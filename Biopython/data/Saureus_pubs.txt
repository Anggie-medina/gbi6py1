TI  - Development of food-grade antimicrobials of fenugreek oil
      nanoemulsion-bioactivity and toxicity analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-19116-y [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobials of natural origin are proving to be an effective solution to
      emerging antimicrobial resistance and its physiological side effects. Recent
      studies have demonstrated that essential oils encapsulated in the form of
      nanoemulsions have better antimicrobial activity than the oil itself, possibly
      due to its high stability, solubility, sustained release, and increased
      bioavailability. In the present study, fenugreek oil-a well-known antimicrobial
      and antioxidant-has been used to fabricate nanoemulsion (NE), with an objective
      to meet potential alternative to synthesized antimicrobials. A combination of
      three different components, water, fenugreek oil, and Tween 80, has been used to 
      prepare the nanoemulsions of different size and one of the most stable
      nanoemulsion with lowest concentration of surfactant Tween 80 was used to assess 
      its bioactivity, antimicrobial properties, and toxicity against human hepatic
      cell line. Among all the formulations, nano-emulsion with 2.5% oil concentration,
      30 min sonication (hydrodynamic size 135.2 nm, zeta potential 36.8 mV, PDI 0.135,
      and pH 5.12), was selected for all studies. The nanoemulsion showed potential
      antibacterial activity against all the microbial strains (Escherichia coli,
      Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) used in
      this study. Interestingly, the nanoemulsion showed potential antibacterial
      activity against P. aeruginosa, known to show resistance against ampicillin. The 
      toxicity evaluation in human hepatic cell line (WRL-68) indicated no significant 
      toxicity of nanoemulsion up to the concentration of 800 microg/ml. The
      synthesized nanoemulsion thus has a translational potential as a food-grade
      non-toxic natural nanoantimicrobials.

AB  - Artemisia species are important traditional medicinal plants of Ethiopia which
      are used for the treatment of infection and non-infection health problems. The
      genus Artemisia (Astraceae) consists of about 500 species worldwide. In this
      study, the main aim was to investigate chemical components of Artemisia spp. (A. 
      abyssinica, A. absinthium and A. annua) and evaluate their antimicrobial
      activities against bacterial strains. The results indicated that the crude
      extract of these plants was effective against selected bacterial strains. Here we
      isolated the well-known antimalarial drug artemisinin (7 mg, 0.004%) from
      Artemisia annua leaves using a rapid n-hexane fractionation method. The n-hexane 
      extract of A. abyssinica, ethyl acetate extract of A. absinthium and n-hexane of 
      A. annua showed varying degrees of inhibiting effect against bacterial strains
      such as Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923( T), Salmonella enteritidis
      ATCC13076(T), Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC1053(T), boydii ATCC1233(T), Escherichia 
      coli ATCC 25922( T), hospital acquired Acinetobacter baumannii. The ethyl acetate
      extract of Artemisia absinthium (A.abe) showed the maximum inhibiting effect (35 
      mm) against A. baumannii. The minimum zone of inhibition (< 3 mm) was recorded
      for test extract of A.ap against Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC1053(T). Ethyl acetate
      extract of A, absinthium (A.abe) was more effective against these selected
      bacterial strains and the zone of inhibition ranged from 5 to 35 mm. The minimum 
      inhibition zone (8 mm) was detected against S. typhimurium ATCC 13311( T) for
      both A.ac and n-hexane- EtOAc fraction (8:2) of A, abyssinica. The maximum zone
      of inhibition (25 mm) for fraction (A.ach F4) of A, abyssinica obtained by column
      chromatography was recorded against S. pyogen ATCC 19,615. However, there was no 
      zone of inhibition detected for boydii ATCC1233(T) due to these test extracts.
      Significant variations (P >/= 0.05) were observed between all test extracts of
      these medicinal plants at 95% of confidence intervals. In this study, clear zones
      of inhibition were detected for the positive control (standard impregnated
      disks). Based on our results we recommend that various species of Artemisia spp. 
      seem to have the potential for in-depth investigation for various antimicrobial
      activities that assisting the effort in searching for antimicrobial lead
      compounds.

TI  - Proteomic Profiles of Staphylococcus aureus Strains Associated with Subclinical
      Bovine Mastitis.
PG  - 101
LID - 10.1007/s00284-022-02796-7 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is the main pathogen associated with bovine mastitis, an
      intramammary inflammation that leads to significant economic losses in dairy
      herds. Efforts have been made to identify the bacterial determinants important to
      the infective process but most of the studies are focused on surface and secreted
      proteins. Considering that virulence is affected by metabolism, in this study we 
      contrasted the proteome of strains of S. aureus causing persistent subclinical
      (Sau302 and Sau340) and clinical bovine mastitis (RF122). Protein expressions
      from cytosolic fractions of bacteria grown under conditions mimicking the
      mastitic mammary glands are reported. A total of 342 proteins was identified, 52 
      of which were differentially expressed. Among those down-regulated in the
      subclinical strains were the two-component sensor histidine kinase SaeS and PurH,
      both involved in bacterial virulence. The ribosome hibernation promotion factor
      and the 50S ribosomal protein L13 were up-regulated suggesting that Sau302 and
      Sau340 modulate protein translation, a condition that may contribute to bacterial
      survival under stressful conditions. TRAP, a regulator possibly involved in
      pathogenesis, was expressed only in RF122 while proteins from the Isd system,
      involved in heme acquisition, were exclusive to Sau302 and Sau340. In summary,
      the metabolic differences suggest a reduced virulence of the strains causing
      subclinical mastitis which may contribute to the persistent infection seen in the
      animals.

      measures.
LID - 10.1007/s12223-022-00954-9 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a serious threat to public health. S. aureus infection
      can cause acute or long-term persistent infections that are often resistant to
      antibiotics and are associated with high morbidity and death. Understanding the
      defensive systems of S. aureus can help clinicians make the best use of
      antimicrobial drugs and can also help with antimicrobial stewardship. The
      mechanisms and clinical implications of S. aureus defense systems, as well as
      potential response systems, were discussed in this study. Because resistance to
      all currently available antibiotics is unavoidable, new medicines are always
      being developed. Alternative techniques, such as anti-virulence and bacteriophage
      therapies, are being researched and may become major tools in the fight against
      staphylococcal infections in the future, in addition to the development of new
      small compounds that affect cell viability.

TI  - Roles of mannosylerythritol lipid-B components in antimicrobial activity against 
      bovine mastitis-causing Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 54
LID - 10.1007/s11274-022-03243-2 [doi]
AB  - Mannosylerythritol lipid-B (MEL-B), which comprises ester-bonded hydrophilic ME
      and hydrophobic fatty acids, is a bio-surfactant with various unique properties, 
      including antimicrobial activity against most gram-positive bacteria. The
      gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus is a causative pathogen of dairy cattle
      mastitis, which results in considerable economic loss in the dairy industry.
      Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of MEL-B as a disinfectant against
      bovine-derived S. aureus and elucidate a mechanism of action of MEL-B in the
      inhibition of bacterial growth. The growth of bovine mastitis causative S. aureus
      BM1006 was inhibited when cultured with MEL-B above 10 ppm. The activity of MEL-B
      required fatty acids (i.e., caprylic and myristoleic acids) as ME, the component 
      of MEL-B lacking fatty acids, did not inhibit the growth of S. aureus even at
      high concentrations. Importantly, ME-bound fatty acids effectively inhibited the 
      growth of S. aureus when compared with free fatty acids. Specifically, the
      concentrations of ME-bound fatty acids and free caprylic and myristoleic acids
      required to inhibit the growth of S. aureus were 10, 1442, and 226 ppm,
      respectively. The involvement of ME in the antimicrobial activity of MEL-B was
      confirmed by digestion of MEL-B with alkali, which dissociated ME and fatty
      acids. These results indicated that a mechanism of action of MEL-B in inhibiting 
      the growth of S. aureus could be explained by the effective transporting of
      antimicrobial fatty acids to the bacterial surface via hydrophilic ME.

TI  - Infective endocarditis in children and adolescents: a different profile with
      clinical implications.
LID - 10.1038/s41390-022-01959-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to compare pediatric infective endocarditis (IE) with the
      clinical profile and outcomes of IE in adults. METHODS: Prospective multicenter
      registry in 31 Spanish hospitals including all patients with a diagnosis of IE
      from 2008 to 2020. RESULTS: A total of 5590 patients were included, 49 were <18
      years (0.1%). Congenital heart disease (CHD) was present in 31 children and
      adolescents (63.2%). Right-sided location was more common in children/adolescents
      than in adults (46.9% vs. 6.3%, P < 0.001). Pediatric pulmonary IE was more
      frequent in patients with CHD (48.4%) than in those without (5.6%), P = 0.004.
      Staphylococcus aureus etiology tended to be more common in pediatric patients
      (32.7%) than in adults (22.3%), P = 0.082. Heart failure was less common in
      pediatric patients than in adults, due to the lower rate of heart failure in
      children/adolescents with CHD (9.6%) with respect to those without CHD (44.4%), P
      = 0.005. Inhospital mortality was high in both children, and adolescents and
      adults (16.3% vs. 25.9%; P = 0.126). CONCLUSIONS: Most IE cases in children and
      adolescents are seen in patients with CHD that have a more common right-sided
      location and a lower prevalence of heart failure than patients without CHD. IE in
      children and adolescents without CHD has a more similar profile to IE in adults. 
      IMPACT: Infective endocarditis (IE) in children and adolescents is often seen in 
      patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Right-sided location is the most
      common in patients with CHD and heart failure is less common as a complication
      compared with patients without CHD. Infective endocarditis (IE) in
      children/adolescents without CHD has a more similar profile to IE in adults. In
      children/adolescents without CHD, locations were similar to adults, including a
      predominance of left-sided IE. Acute heart failure was the most frequent
      complication, seen mainly in adults, and in children/adolescents without CHD.

TI  - Ionic Interaction-Driven Switchable Bactericidal Surfaces.
LID - S1742-7061(22)00079-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.actbio.2022.02.003 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria in the external environment inevitably invade the wound and subsequently
      colonize the wound surface during surgery and biomedical operations, which slows 
      down the process of wound healing and tissue repair; this poses a significant
      threat to human health. Therefore, the development of an intelligent
      antibacterial surface has become the focus of research in the field of
      antimicrobial strategies, which has important social and economic significance.
      Here, we present a simple approach of producing an ionic interaction-driven
      anionic activation substratum which is then functionalized with cationic
      molecules through coulombic interactional immobilization. The switchable
      multifunctional antibacterial surface can decrease bacterial attachment and
      inactivate the attached microorganisms, thus overcoming the conventional
      challenge for antibacterial surfaces. Briefly, poly (3-sulfopropyl methacrylate
      potassium salt) (PSPMA) brushes were constructed by surface-initiated atom
      transfer radical polymerization on silicon or cotton fabric substrates, and a
      positive-charged component, namely lysozyme (LYZ), hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium
      bromide (CTAB) or chitosan (CS), was loaded on negative-charged sulfonate groups 
      through electrostatic interactions. The resultant brush-grafted surfaces
      exhibited more than approximately 95.5% bactericidal efficacy and approximately
      92.8% release rate after the introduction of an adequate amount of contra-ions
      (1.0 M; Na(+) & Cl(-)) against both Gram-negative Escherichia coli and
      Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, thus achieving a regenerated surface through
      the cyclic process of "assembly-dissociation"." Smart cotton fabric
      (Fabric-PSPMA/LYZ and Fabric-PSPMA/CS) surfaces were constructed, which were
      found to promote wound epidermal tissue regeneration with a higher efficiency
      after 7-day in vivo studies. This ionic interaction-driven method used in the
      present work is simple and can reversibly renew antibacterial surfaces, which
      will help in the wider utilization of switchable antibacterial materials with a
      more ecologic and economic significance. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Smart
      antibacterial surfaces with renewable characteristics have attracted considerable
      interests over the past few years. Here, we used ionic interaction-driven force
      to manipulate dynamic conformational changes in PSPMA surface brushes,
      accompanied by highly switchable bacteria killing and bacteria releasing
      behaviors. Different cationic molecules were also designed for
      assembly/dissociation on the PSPMA-modified surfaces, and the essential
      parameters, including chemical structures, molecular weight, and cationic charge 
      density, were investigated. With the refined structural combinations and the
      balance of bacteria killing/bacteria releasing behaviors, smart cotton fabrics
      (e.g., Fabric-PSPMA/lysozyme and Fabric-PSPMA/chitosan) were designed that could 
      promote wound healing and tissue repair. These results contribute to the
      fundamental understanding of a switchable cationic-anionic pair design and the
      corresponding practical, renewable, highly antibacterial fabric.

TI  - Central line-associated bloodstream infections, multidrug-resistant bacteraemias 
      and infection control interventions: a six-year time-series analysis in a
      tertiary-care hospital in Greece.
LID - S0195-6701(22)00036-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jhin.2022.01.020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) are serious
      healthcare-associated infections with substantial morbidity and hospital costs.
      AIM: To investigate the association between the incidence of CLABSI, the
      implementation of specific infection control measures, and the incidence of
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteraemias in a tertiary-care hospital in Greece from
      2013-2018. METHODS: Analysis was applied for the following monthly calculated
      indices: 1.CLABSI rate, 2.use of hand hygiene disinfectants, 3.isolation rate of 
      patients with MDR bacteria, 4.incidence of bacteraemias [total resistant
      Gram-negative: carbapenem-resistant (CR) Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and/or Gram-positive: meticillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci]. FINDINGS: Total
      bacteraemias from CR-Gram-negative pathogens statistically correlated with
      increased CLABSI rate in total Hospital Departments (IRR: 1.17, 95% CI:
      1.05-1.31, p-value: 0.006) and Adults ICU (IRR: 1.37, 95%CI: 1.07-1.75, p-value: 
      0.013). In Adults ICU, every increase in the incidence of each resistant
      Gram-negative pathogen significantly correlated with decreased CLABSI rate (CR-A.
      baumanii: IRR: 0.59, 95%CI: 0.39-0.90, p-value=0.015; CR-K. pneumoniae: IRR:
      0.48, 95%CI: 0.25-0.94, p-value=0.031; CR-P. aeruginosa: IRR: 0.54, 95%CI:
      0.33-0.89, p-value=0.015). The use of hand disinfectants correlated with
      decreased CLABSI rate 1-3 months before the application of this intervention, in 
      total Hospital Departments (IRR: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.69-0.93, p-value: 0.005), and for
      scrub disinfectants the current month in Adults ICU (IRR: 0.34, 95%CI: 0.11-1.03,
      p-value: 0.057). Isolation of patients with MDR pathogens was not associated with
      CLABSI incidence. CONCLUSION: Hand hygiene was associated with a significant
      reduction of CLABSI incidence in our hospital. Time-series analysis is an
      important tool to evaluate infection control interventions.

TI  - Predominance of Staphylococcus correlates with wound burden and disease activity 
      in dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: a prospective case-control study.

AB  - Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is characterized by skin
      blistering and wounds. To uncover changes in skin and mucosal microbiome related 
      to age and disease progression, and microbiome impact on clinical and
      inflammatory laboratory parameters, swabs from wounded and unwounded skin, oral
      mucosa and stool samples of 28 children with RDEB and 28 healthy controls were
      subjected to 16S-rRNA gene sequencing. Skin microbiome of RDEB patients showed
      significantly reduced alpha diversity compared to healthy controls and early,
      age-dependent predominance of Staphylococcus aureus first in wounds, then in
      unwounded skin. These findings were more pronounced in severe disease with higher
      abundances of Staphylococcus aureus compared to intermediate disease.
      Staphylococcus aureus abundance correlated significantly with both acute and
      chronic wound burden. Changes in oral mucosal and gut microbiome were discrete
      with no significant differences in alpha diversity. Our findings show that
      children with RDEB experience skin microbiome changes early in life. Longitudinal
      studies should confirm that dysbiosis starts in wounds and later extends to
      unwounded skin. The predominance of Staphylococcus aureus significantly
      correlates with wound burden and disease activity, and to some extent with
      systemic inflammation.

AB  - Coevolution between hosts and parasites is a major driver of rapid evolutionary
      change(1) and diversification.(2)(,)(3) However, direct antagonistic interactions
      between hosts and parasites could be disrupted(4) when host microbiota form a
      line of defense, a phenomenon widespread across animal and plant
      species.(5)(,)(6) By suppressing parasite infection, protective microbiota could 
      reduce the need for host-based defenses and favor host support for microbiota
      colonization,(6) raising the possibility that the microbiota can alter
      host-parasite coevolutionary patterns and processes.(7) Here, using an
      experimental evolution approach, we co-passaged populations of nematode host
      (Caenorhabditis elegans) and parasites (Staphylococcus aureus) when hosts were
      colonized (or not) by protective bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis). We found that 
      microbial protection during coevolution resulted in the evolution of host
      mortality tolerance-higher survival following parasite infection-and in parasites
      adapting to microbial defenses. Compared to unprotected host-parasite
      coevolution, the protected treatment was associated with reduced dominance of
      fluctuating selection dynamics in host populations. No differences in host
      recombination rate or genetic diversity were detected. Genomic divergence was
      observed between parasite populations coevolved in protected and unprotected
      hosts. These findings indicate that protective host microbiota can determine the 
      evolution of host defense strategies and shape host-parasite coevolutionary
      dynamics.

TI  - Clinical results of a lamina with spinous process and an iliac graft as bone
      grafts in the surgical treatment of single-segment lumbar pyogenic
      spondylodiscitis: a retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1186/s12893-022-01506-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A retrospective study compared the results of a lamina with spinous
      process (LSP) and an iliac graft (IG) as bone grafts in single-segment lumbar
      pyogenic spondylodiscitis (LPS) through one-stage-posterior-only approach with
      radical debridement and instrumentation. METHODS: A LSP was placed in 17 patients
      (group A), and an IG was implemented in 20 patients (group B). The surgery time, 
      surgery hemorrhage, hospital stay, drainage, and follow-up (FU) were recorded and
      compared. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP)
      level, visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), segmental
      angle, intervertebral height and bony fusion time were compared preoperatively
      and at the final FU. RESULTS: All patients were followed-up for a mean of 27.94
      +/- 2.35 months in group A and 30.29 +/- 1.89 months in group B, without a
      difference. The mean age was younger in group A than in group B (P < 0.05). The
      surgery time, surgery hemorrhage, and hospitalization cost were lower in group A 
      than in group B (P < 0.05), except for the hospital stay and drainage time. 10
      patients in group A had fever and 12 patients in group B. The ESR, CRP level, VAS
      and ODI scores were significantly decreased, and no significant differences were 
      found between the groups at the final FU. The distribution of bacterial agents in
      blood culture was 1 case of Aerobacter cloacae, 2 of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of 
      Escherichia coli, and 1 of Streptococcus viridis in group A and 1 of S. aureus, 1
      of Staphylococcus warneri and 2 of Klebsiella pneumoniae in group B. Pyogenic
      infection was observed in the pathological findings of all patients. No
      significant difference was found in the mean segmental angle or mean
      intervertebral height preoperation and at the final FU. CONCLUSION: The use of
      LSP could be an effective bone grafting for surgical management for the LPS while
      surgery is proposed as a good management strategy for single-segment LPS in
      carefully selected patients.

TI  - A novel dressing with silver to treat meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
      biofilm infection in a pig model.
PG  - S42-S48
LID - 10.12968/jowc.2022.31.Sup2.S42 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to use an in vivo biofilm porcine model 
      to examine a new polyvinyl alcohol-based gelling fibre dressing with silver and
      compare it to other commercial dressings containing: polyvinyl alcohol-based
      gelling fibre without silver; carboxymethyl cellulose-based fibre with silver,
      benzethonium chloride and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; and untreated control.
      METHODS: A total of 52 deep partial-thickness wounds (10x7x0.5mm) were created on
      each of three animals and inoculated with 25microl of meticillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (10(6) colony forming units (CFU)/ml). Wounds were
      covered for 24 hours to allow biofilm formation and were randomly designated to
      one of the four treatments. Samples were recovered for microbiological and
      histological analysis on days 3, 5 and 7 post-treatment. RESULTS: Polyvinyl
      alcohol-based gelling fibre dressing with silver was able to significantly reduce
      biofilm more effectively than the other treatment groups. By day 7, wounds
      treated with the dressing had a 2.72+/-0.01 log CFU/g reduction in MRSA count
      versus untreated control wounds and a 2.59+/-0.01 log CFU/g reduction versus
      baseline counts. For histology analysis, all wounds reached 100%
      re-epithelialisation by day 5. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicated
      that polyvinyl alcohol-based gelling fibre dressing with silver was effective
      against biofilm of antibiotic-resistant staphylococcal strains without inhibiting
      the wound healing process, and may have important clinical implications when
      treating acute and/or hard-to-heal wounds.

TI  - Ventilator-Associated Lower Respiratory Tract Bacterial Infections in COVID-19
      Compared With Non-COVID-19 Patients.
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000005462 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections (VA-LRTIs)
      are associated with prolonged length of stay and increased mortality. We aimed to
      investigate the occurrence of bacterial VA-LRTI among mechanically ventilated
      COVID-19 patients and compare these findings to non-COVID-19 cohorts throughout
      the first and second wave of the pandemic. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
      SETTING: Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. PATIENTS: All
      patients greater than or equal to 18 years treated with mechanical ventilation
      between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS
      AND MAIN RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 20,223 ICU episodes (479 COVID-19),
      with a VA-LRTI incidence proportion of 30% (129/426) in COVID-19 and 18%
      (1,081/5,907) in non-COVID-19 among patients ventilated greater than or equal to 
      48 hours. The median length of ventilator treatment for COVID-19 patients was 10 
      days (interquartile range, 5-18 d), which was significantly longer than for all
      other investigated specific diagnoses. The VA-LRTI incidence rate per 1,000
      ventilator days at risk was 31 (95% CI, 26-37) for COVID-19 and 34 (95% CI,
      32-36) for non-COVID-19. With COVID-19 as reference, adjusted subdistribution
      hazard ratios for VA-LRTI was 0.29-0.50 (95% CI, < 1) for influenza, bacterial
      pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and severe sepsis, but 1.38 (95% 
      CI, 1.15-1.65) for specific noninfectious diagnoses. Compared with COVID-19 in
      the first wave of the pandemic, COVID-19 in the second wave had adjusted
      subdistribution hazard ratio of 1.85 (95% CI, 1.14-2.99). In early VA-LRTI
      Staphylococcus aureus was more common and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus
      influenzae, and Escherichia coli less common in COVID-19 patients, while Serratia
      species was more often identified in late VA-LRTI. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is
      associated with exceptionally long durations of mechanical ventilation treatment 
      and high VA-LRTI occurrence proportions. The incidence rate of VA-LRTI was
      compared with the pooled non-COVID-19 cohort, however, not increased in COVID-19.
      Significant differences in the incidence of VA-LRTI occurred between the first
      and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Suction drainage fluid culture during septic orthopaedic surgery, a retrospective
      study.

AB  - We evaluated the usefulness of suction drainage fluid culture after septic
      orthopaedic surgery to predict early surgical reintervention. We conducted a
      retrospective observational study, at the Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph
      between 2014 and 2019. All the patients undergoing septic orthopaedic surgery,
      with perioperative samples and a postoperative suction drainage device, were
      enrolled. We compared the group with positive or negative postoperative drainage 
      fluid cultures, respectively, on surgical outcome. We included 246 patients. The 
      drainage fluid culture was positive in 42.3% of the cases. Early surgical
      reintervention concerned 14.6% of the cases (n = 36), including 61.1% of patients
      with positive drainage fluid culture (n = 22/36). The risk factors associated
      with positive drainage fluid cultures were the debridement of the infected site
      (without orthopaedic device removal), an infection located at the spine,
      perioperative positive cultures to Staphylococcus aureus. The complete change of 
      the orthopaedic device, and coagulase-negative staphylococci on the preoperative 
      samples, was associated with negative drainage fluid cultures. Positive drainage 
      fluid culture was predictive of early surgical reintervention, and
      coagulase-negative staphylococci in the preoperative samples and knee infection
      were predictive of surgical success. Postoperative drainage fluid cultures were
      predictive of early surgical reintervention. Randomized multicentric studies
      should be further conducted.

AB  - A system for the rapid and ultra-sensitive detection of Staphylococcus aureus (S.
      aureus), a prevalent foodborne pathogen is introduced. Limitations of typical
      electrochemical sensing, often subjected to interference from non-specific
      protein adsorption are addressed. A dual-aptamer-based sandwich immunobiosensor
      is shown for its benefits regarding specificity and anti-fouling capacity,
      endowed by a sulfonated polyaniline layer combined with signal amplification via 
      highly conductive gold nanoparticles. EIS spectra (Nyquist plots) were recorded
      at pH 7.4 PBS containing 5 mM Fe(CN)6(3-)/Fe(CN)6(4-), in order to verify the
      possibility of the electrochemical sensing for detection of S. aureus. Results
      demonstrated that the constructed immunobiosensor presents an extended detection 
      range (1 x 10(1) to 1 x 10(5) CFU/mL) and detection limit as low as 2 CFU/mL. The
      resistance values of the immunobiosensor developed maintain at a stable value
      during 2 weeks. Besides, the specificity of the system is highlighted by testing 
      raw milk, and the results of which demonstrate the excellent prospects of the
      system for monitoring foodborne pathogens.

LID - 10.7417/CT.2022.2386 [doi]
AB  - Abstract: we present our experiences of a patient with right femoral artery and
      right coronary artery pseudoaneurysms after percutaneous coro-nary intervention
      (PCI). These complications are rare in transfemoral coronary intervention. The
      patient underwent PCI to treat a chronic total occlusion (CTO) lesion at the
      right coronary artery (RCA) and developed sepsis due to Staphylococcus aureus
      infection following the use of femoral artery closure devices (FACD). To solve
      these complications, the patient underwent two vascular surgeries and a coronary 
      artery bypass grafting (CABG) to the RCA. To manage these conditions, we need to 
      recognize them early and treat them properly by surgery. Interventional
      cardiologists should keep in mind that there are potential vascular complications
      associated with a PCI using FACD.

TI  - Pre-operative leukocytosis: a potential poor prognosis risk factor in cardiac
      device implantation: a case report.
PG  - 6-9
LID - 10.7417/CT.2022.2383 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Despite the benefits of the implantation of cardiac rhythm
      management devices cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infection is an
      emerging problem New debate emerged about the unclear role of the pre-operative
      alteration of pro-inflammatory parameters, such as leukocytosis, in the
      development CIED infection and/or heart failure, and its consequent impact on the
      timing of ICD implantation/reimplantation. Case report: A 65 years old patient
      with a history of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) type II, ventricular and
      supraventricular arrhythmias, chronic myocardial ischemia, heart failure was
      admitted to hospital. Healthcare workers opted for ICD implantation despite the
      presence of a persistent leukocytosis with normothermia. Five days later the
      implantation, patient showed fever and heart failure; blood culture resulted
      positive for Staphylococcus Aureus. Patient died for sepsis syndrome due to a
      cardiac device-related infection after a few days, despite the device extraction.
      Discussion: Cardiac device implantation remains a necessary surgi-cal procedure
      in order to reduce sudden cardiac death's rate in patients with heart failure.
      Leukocytosis is a new potential poor prognosis risk factor. The relationship
      between pro-inflammatory markers', such as CRP and white blood cell count, and
      device implantation is still not entirely clear. Pro-inflammatory markers could
      facilitate an infection development; recent study hypothesized that these markers
      could promote the development of heart failure. Conclusion: Leukocytosis could
      represent a poor prognosis risk factor favoring the development of CIED infection
      and/or heart failure.

TI  - Te-Cefotaxime nanocomposites with restored antibiotic susceptibility and the LED 
      light activated photothermal effect for rapid MRSA eradication.
LID - 10.1039/d1tb02538d [doi]
AB  - The ever-growing antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose a huge threat to public
      health. Restoring the susceptibility of ineffective antibiotics by inorganic
      nanomaterials and combining the photothermal and antibiotic effects could be an
      optional strategy to combat this resistance. Here, cefotaxime (CTX) loaded
      tellurium nanoparticles (Te NPs) were fabricated to recover the antibacterial
      activity of the ineffective beta-lactam antibiotic CTX against
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and at the same time perform
      photothermal therapy under light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation with a
      wavelength in the range of 420-480 nm. The combination of 50 mug mL(-1) Te-CTX
      NPs with 5 min LED irradiation produced a 30.4 degrees C temperature increase and
      killed 99% of MRSA in vitro. In vivo evaluation in mice revealed that Te-CTX NPs 
      and LED irradiation accelerated the healing of MRSA infected wounds and presented
      biosafety. Furthermore, this combination accelerated glutathione oxidation and
      resulted in the disruption of the antioxidant defence system of MRSA. Such a
      synergistic antibiotic and photothermal therapy provides an innovative way for
      the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.

TI  - Synthesis and biological activity profile of novel triazole/quinoline hybrids.
LID - 10.1111/cbdd.14031 [doi]
AB  - Based on the significant and diverse pharmacophore features of triazole ring and 
      considering the potent antimicrobial properties of quinoline scaffold, a novel
      series of 1,2,3-triazole-based polyaromatic compounds containing chloroquinoline 
      moiety were synthesized through a well-established synthetic methodology, named
      click chemistry. The structure of the synthetic compounds was characterized by
      various spectroscopic methods. The final products of triazole/quinoline hybrids
      and ((prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)methyl)benzene intermediates were screened for their
      antibacterial (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and
      Salmonella enterica), antifungal (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and
      Aspergillus fumigatus), and cytotoxic activities. The best antifungal compounds
      exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), in the range of 0.35-0.63
      microM, against S. cerevisiae without any cytotoxic effect. These compounds can
      be selected as the potential candidates for treating invasive fungal infections
      caused by S. cerevisiae, after further investigation. Preliminary in silico ADME 
      studies also predicted the favorable pharmacokinetic attributes of most
      compounds.

TI  - Natural Occurring Phenolic Derivatives from Mauritia flexuosa (Buriti) Stems and 
      Their Potential Antibacterial Activity against Methicillin-Resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
PG  - e202100788
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.202100788 [doi]
AB  - Mauritia flexuosa Linnaeus filius (buriti or aguage; Arecaceae) is a palm used by
      traditional medicine in Brazil to treat dysentery and diarrhea. Our group showed 
      that the soluble dichloromethane (CH2 Cl2 ) fraction from EtOH extract from M.
      flexuosa stems inhibited the growth of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus
      aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and it is rich in
      phenolic compounds. This study aimed to isolate new phenolic compounds from CH2
      Cl2 fraction from M. flexuosa stems with in vitro antibacterial activity. The
      crude CH2 Cl2 fraction was fractionated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
      followed by semi-preparative RP-HPLC. The antibacterial activity was evaluated
      using the broth microdilution method against MSSA (ATCC 29213) and MRSA (clinical
      isolate 155). All compounds were also tested against Gram-negative (Escherichia
      coli; ATCC 35218) bacteria and two fungi species (Candida albicans; ATCC 14053
      and Trichophyton rubrum; ATCC MYA 4438). The chemical structures of isolated
      compounds were determined by analysis and comparison with literature data of
      their NMR and HRMS spectra and optical activity. The chemical investigation
      yielded seven aromatic compounds, of which four,
      (2S,15S)-2,15-dimethyl-2,15-dioxa-1,8(1,4)-dibenzenacyclotetradecaphane (1),
      (2S,5S)-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)hexane-2,5-diol (3), bruguierol E (4), and buritin (5)
      were previously unreported and three are known compounds identified as
      6-(4'-hydroxyphenyl) hexan-2-one (2), (+)-(2R,3R)-dihydrokaempferol (6), and
      (+)-(2R)-naringenin (7). Compounds 1 and 7 showed antibacterial activity against 
      MRSA and MSSA with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of between 62.5 and
      31.3 mug/mL, respectively. Our preliminary findings support that CH2 Cl2 fraction
      from buriti, a typical species of flooded areas of Brazilian savanna, and its
      aromatic phenolic compounds are active against MSSA and MRSA contributing with
      understanding about the traditional use of this species.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and viral analysis of severe influenza A [H1N1]pdm09 in 
      Guangzhou, 2019.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.27642 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the clinical characteristics of and analyze viral genes 
      in patients with severe pneumonia due to [H1N1]pdm09 influenza virus in
      Guangzhou, 2019. METHODS: The clinical data of 120 inpatients with
      laboratory-confirmed influenza A H1N1 virus from January to March 2019 were
      collected and analyzed. The subjects were diagnosed according to the criteria of 
      the "Diagnosis and Treatment Program of Influenza A H1N1 (third Edition 2009)"
      issued by the Ministry of Health and were divided into severe and nonsevere
      groups. Serum samples during fever were collected for cytokine analysis, and the 
      viral genes were analyzed after the virus cultured in MDCK cells. The data were
      analyzed by SPSS 16 software, and the results of gene sequencing were analyzed by
      MEGA 6 software. RESULTS: Among the 120 inpatients, 36 (30%) were severe and 84
      (70%) were nonsevere patients. The average age of severe patients was 53.11
      +/-19.94 years, the average age of nonsevere patients, at 44.03 +/-24.47 years.
      There was no significant difference between the two groups (p< 0.05). There were 
      significant differences in the rates of moist rales and dyspnea in critically ill
      patients (p< 0.05). There were significant differences in the white blood cell
      count (WBC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), serum creatinine 
      (sCr), procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in severe patients with
      type A H1N1. Chest radiologic findings in severe patients showed ground glass
      shadows or pulmonary solid changes, and the difference was statistically
      significant for pulmonary fibrosis. Chronic lung disease (52.8%) and
      cardiovascular disease (27.8%) were independent risk factors for severe disease
      (p< 0.05). There were significant differences in secondary infections by
      Staphylococcus aureus (11.1%), pulmonary Aspergillus (22%) and Acinetobacter
      baumannii (16.7%) in critically ill patients (p< 0.05). Serum IL-8 in critically 
      ill patients was significantly higher than those in nonsevere patients and
      healthy controls. The origin of virus strains in severe and nonsevere patients
      was the same, and there was no obvious mutation in the amino acid region of the
      antigenic site of the HA protein, but compared with the results of gene
      sequencing in previous years, the mutation sites showed a trend of annual
      accumulation. In conclusion, there was a high risk of severe pneumonia caused by 
      H1N1 influenza A virus in Guangzhou in spring 2019. Long-term continuous
      surveillance, prevention and control of the virus should be carried out to
      predict its epidemiology and distribution. This article is protected by

TI  - Multicenter Cohort Study of Ceftaroline Versus Daptomycin for Treatment of
      Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Bloodstream Infection.
PG  - ofab606
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofab606 [doi]
AB  - Background: Observational data suggest ceftaroline may be effective for
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection (BSI),
      but comparative data with standard of care are limited. This analysis compares
      the outcomes of MRSA BSI treated with ceftaroline or daptomycin. Methods:
      Multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study of adult patients with
      MRSA BSI from 2010 to 2017. Patients treated with >/=72 hours of ceftaroline or
      daptomycin were included. Those clearing BSI before study drug and those with a
      pneumonia source were excluded. The primary outcome was composite treatment
      failure, defined as 30-day mortality, BSI duration >/=7 days on study drug, and
      60-day MRSA BSI recurrence. Inverse probability of treatment weighted risk
      difference in composite failure between daptomycin and ceftaroline groups was
      computed and 15% noninferiority margin applied. Results: Two hundred seventy
      patients were included; 83 ceftaroline and 187 daptomycin. Ceftaroline was
      noninferior to daptomycin with respect to composite failure (39% daptomycin,
      32.5% ceftaroline; weighted risk difference, 7.0% [95% confidence interval, -5.0%
      to 19.0%]). No differences between treatment groups was observed for 30-day
      mortality or other secondary efficacy outcomes. Creatine phosphokinase elevation 
      was significantly more common among daptomycin patients (5.3% vs 0%, P = .034).
      Rash was significantly more common among ceftaroline patients (10.8 vs 1.1%, P = 
      .001). Conclusions: No difference in treatment failure or mortality was observed 
      between MRSA BSI treated with ceftaroline or daptomycin. These data support
      future study of ceftaroline as a primary MRSA BSI treatment and current use of
      ceftaroline when an alternative to vancomycin and daptomycin is required.

AB  - Vaginal microbiota dominated by lactobacilli protects women from sexually
      transmitted infection, in particular HIV-1. This protection is, in part, mediated
      by Lactobacillus-released extracellular vesicles (EVs). Here, we investigated
      whether EVs derived from other Gram-positive bacteria also present in healthy
      vaginas, in particular Staphylococcus aureus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Enterococcus
      faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis, can affect vaginal HIV-1 infection. We found 
      that EVs released by these bacteria protect human cervico-vaginal tissues ex vivo
      and isolated cells from HIV-1 infection by inhibiting HIV-1-cell receptor
      interactions. This inhibition was associated with a diminished exposure of viral 
      Env by steric hindrance of gp120 or gp120 modification evidenced by the failure
      of EV-treated virions to bind to nanoparticle-coupled anti-Env antibodies.
      Furthermore, we found that protein components associated with EV's outer surface 
      are critical for EV-mediated protection from HIV-1 infection since treatment of
      bacteria-released EVs with proteinase K abolished their anti-HIV-1 effect. We
      identified numerous EV-associated proteins that may be involved in this
      protection. The identification of EVs with specific proteins that suppress HIV-1 
      may lead to the development of novel strategies for the prevention of HIV-1
      transmission.

TI  - Antimicrobial oxygen-loaded nanobubbles as promising tools to promote wound
      healing in hypoxic human keratinocytes.

AB  - Chronic wounds (CWs) are typically characterized by persistent hypoxia,
      exacerbated inflammation, and impaired skin tissue remodeling. Additionally, CWs 
      are often worsened by microbial infections. Oxygen-loaded nanobubbles (OLNBs),
      displaying a peculiar structure based on oxygen-solving perfluorocarbons such as 
      perfluoropentane in the inner core and polysaccharydes including chitosan in the 
      outer shell, have proven effective in delivering oxygen to hypoxic tissues.
      Antimicrobial properties have been largely reported for chitosan. In the present 
      work chitosan/perfluoropentane OLNBs were challenged for biocompatibility with
      human skin cells and ability to promote wound healing processes, as well as for
      their antimicrobial properties against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA) and Candida albicans. After cellular internalization, OLNBs were
      not toxic to human keratinocytes (HaCaT), whereas oxygen-free NBs (OFNBs)
      slightly affected their viability. Hypoxia-dependent inhibition of keratinocyte
      migratory ability after scratch was fully reversed by OLNBs, but not OFNBs. Both 
      OLNBs and OFNBs exerted chitosan-induced short-term bacteriostatic activity
      against MRSA (up to 6 h) and long-term fungistatic activity against C. albicans
      (up to 24 h). Short-term antibacterial activity associated with NB prolonged
      adhesion to MRSA cell wall (up to 24 h) while long-term antifungal activity
      followed NB early internalization by C. albicans (already after 3 h of
      incubation). Taken altogether, these data support chitosan-shelled and
      perfluoropentane-cored OLNB potential as innovative, promising, non-toxic, and
      cost-effective antimicrobial devices promoting repair processes to be used for
      treatment of MRSA- and C. albicans-infected CWs.

AB  - Spontaneous rupture of the urinary bladder represents a rare condition that may
      complicate with paravesical abscess. Although Staphylococcus aureus may be a part
      of the intestinal tract flora, it is an unusual cause of abdominal or pelvic
      abscesses. We report the case of a male patient with spontaneous bladder
      perforation with osteomyelitis and paravesical abscess, secondary to
      community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.

AB  - Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common pathogens
      causing skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI). Guideline-recommended empiric
      antibiotics targeting these organisms would also treat coagulase negative
      Staphylococci, which are not typically considered skin and soft tissue pathogens.
      Coagulase negative Staphylococci are, however, well known for their propensity to
      cause indolent infections in the setting of prosthetic material. Here, we present
      a case of a patient with surgical clips from a femoral artery surgical repair one
      year prior, presenting with cellulitis at the prior surgical site, complicated by
      high-grade Staphylococcus hominis bacteremia. Signs of infection persisted after 
      4 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy and resolved rapidly upon non-steroidal 
      anti-inflammatory administration. This case highlights the importance of
      recognizing coagulase negative Staphylococci as a possible etiology of cellulitis
      in patients with prosthetic material, and of considering anti-inflammatory
      medications as a supplement to antibiotic therapy to hasten resolution of
      cellulitis in appropriate patients.

LID - 10.7573/dic.2021-8-9 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health threat due to its associated
      increase in mortality, and the most appropriate treatment algorithms for
      resistant and persistent Gram-positive and Gram-negative infections have yet to
      be elucidated. Whilst combination therapy has been touted as a viable method to
      overcome prominent resistant mechanisms represented amongst these microbes, the
      optimal agents to utilize remains controversial. Beta-lactams have a safe profile
      and are bactericidal against most Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms.
      Thus, the use of dual beta-lactam therapy to overcome multidrug-resistant
      pathogens is of supreme interest. This article reviews the mechanisms of
      beta-lactam resistance in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, discusses the
      rationale for dual beta-lactam use against multidrug-resistant infections (and
      other scenarios in which this strategy may be most utilized in clinical
      practice), explores the available in vitro, in vivo and clinical data, and
      provides considerations for the use of dual beta-lactam therapy against
      Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus,
      Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii pathogens.

TI  - RW-BP100-4D, a Promising Antimicrobial Candidate With Broad-Spectrum Bactericidal
      Activity.

AB  - With the rapid emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
      genes in bacteria from animal, animal-derived food and human clinic, it is of
      great significance to develop new approaches to combat the multidrug-resistant
      bacteria. This study presented a short linear antimicrobial peptide RW-BP100-4D, 
      which was derived from RW-BP100 (RRLFRRILRWL-NH2) by transforming the N-terminal 
      4th amino acid from L- to D-enantiomer. This modification remarkably reduced the 
      peptide cytotoxicity to mammalian cells, as indicated by hemolytic and
      cytotoxicity assays. Meanwhile, the antimicrobial activity of RW-BP100-4D was
      improved against a more variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
      (sensitive and resistant) as well as fungi. Also, RW-BP100-4D showed strong in
      vitro anti-biofilm activity in a concentration-dependent manner, including
      inhibition of the biofilm-formation and dispersion of the mature biofilms of
      Staphylococcus aureus. RW-BP100-4D could be efficiently uptaken by bovine mammary
      epithelial cells (MAC-T) cells to eliminate the intracellular S. aureus ATCC29213
      and Salmonella enterica ATCC13076. Moreover, RW-BP100-4D was highly effective in 
      food disinfection of multiple bacterial contamination (including S. aureus,
      Listeria monocytogenesis, Escherichia coli O157: H7, Campylobacter jejuni, S.
      enterica, and Shewanella putrefaction, 3.61 +/- 0.063 log reduction) on chicken
      meat, and could kill 99.99% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA) strain in the mouse skin infection model. In summary, RW-BP100-4D is a
      promising antimicrobial candidate for application on food disinfection and local 
      infection treatment. However, the protease-sensitivity of RW-BP100-4D and toxic
      effect at higher doses reduced the therapeutic effect of the candidate peptide in
      vivo and should be improved in the future studies.

TI  - Secreted Toxins From Staphylococcus aureus Strains Isolated From Keratinocyte
      Skin Cancers Mediate Pro-tumorigenic Inflammatory Responses in the Skin.
PG  - 789042
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2021.789042 [doi]
AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common type of skin cancer that typically
      arises from premalignant precursor lesions named actinic keratoses (AK). Chronic 
      inflammation is a well-known promoter of skin cancer progression. AK and SCC have
      been associated with an overabundance of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. 
      aureus). Certain secreted products from S. aureus are known to promote cutaneous 
      pro-inflammatory responses; however, not all S. aureus strains produce these. As 
      inflammation plays a key role in SCC development, we investigated the
      pro-inflammatory potential and toxin secretion profiles of skin-cancer associated
      S. aureus. Sterile culture supernatants ("secretomes") of S. aureus clinical
      strains isolated from AK and SCC were applied to human keratinocytes in vitro.
      Some S. aureus secretomes induced keratinocytes to overexpress inflammatory
      mediators that have been linked to skin carcinogenesis, including IL-6, IL-8, and
      TNFalpha. A large phenotypic variation between the tested clinical strains was
      observed. Strains that are highly pro-inflammatory in vitro also caused more
      pronounced skin inflammation in mice. Proteomic characterization of S. aureus
      secretomes using mass spectrometry established that specific S. aureus enzymes
      and cytolytic toxins, including hemolysins, phenol-soluble modulins, and serine
      proteases, as well as currently uncharacterized proteins, correlate with the
      pro-inflammatory S. aureus phenotype. This study is the first to describe the
      toxin secretion profiles of AK and SCC-associated S. aureus, and their potential 
      to induce a pro-inflammatory environment in the skin. Further studies are needed 
      to establish whether these S. aureus products promote SCC development by
      mediating chronic inflammation.

AB  - Reactivation of fetal hemoglobin by editing the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A
      (BCL11A) erythroid enhancer is an effective gene therapy for beta-thalassemia.
      Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, fetal gamma-globin expression can be robustly
      reactivated to mitigate the clinical course of beta-thalassemia. In our study, we
      found that the transfection efficiencies of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor
      cells (HSPCs) were significantly and negatively correlated with the length of
      plasmids and greatly affected by the linearization of plasmids. Furthermore, the 
      transgene expression of minicircles (MC) without plasmid backbone sequences was
      better both in vitro and in vivo compared with conventional plasmids. Thus, MC
      DNA was used to deliver the cassette of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) into 
      HSPCs, and a single-guide RNA targeting the erythroid enhancer region of BCL11A
      was selected. After electroporation with MC DNA, an evident efficiency of gene
      editing and reactivation of gamma-globin expression in erythroblasts derived from
      unsorted HSPCs was acquired. No significant off-target effects were found by deep
      sequencing. Furthermore, fragments derived from lentiviral vectors, but not MC
      DNA, were highly enriched in promoter, exon, intron, distal-intergenic, and
      cancer-associated genes, indicating that MC DNA provided a relatively safe and
      efficient vector for delivering transgenes. The developed MC DNA vector provided 
      a potential approach for the delivery of SaCas9 cassette and the reactivation of 
      gamma-globin expression for ameliorating syndromes of beta-thalassemia.

AB  - Magnesium ferrite nanoparticles (Mg Fe2O4 NPs) was synthesized by a chemical
      co-precipitation method and characterized via structural and optical properties. 
      The surface of Mg Fe2O4 NPs was stabilized with citric acid (CA) by a direct
      addition method (CA-Mg Fe2O4 NPs), then Amoxicillin (AX) was loaded with CA-Mg
      Fe2O4 nanocomposites. Furthermore, their antimicrobial, and antibiofilm
      activities, growth curve, and effect of UV-illumination methods were examined
      against different pathogenic microbes. Based on XRD, HRTEM and SEM analyses, it
      is found that Mg Fe2O4 NPs are located at the core, while the CA and AX are
      coated this core. In-vitro zone of inhibition (ZOI) and minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) results verified that AX-loaded CA-Mg Fe2O4 nanocomposites
      exhibited its encouraged antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, E. coli, and
      C. albicans (32.2, 22.0, and 19.0 mm ZOI, respectively) & (0.312, 0.625, and 1.25
      mug/ml MIC, respectively). AX-CA-Mg Fe2O4 nanocomposites are showed antibiofilm
      percentage against S. aureus (95.34%), E. coli (93.93%), and C. albicans
      (76.23%). AX-CA-MgFe2O4 nanocomposites are an excellent disinfectant agents once 
      they are excited by UV light. Membrane leakage assay explains the formation of
      holes on the surface of bacteria, and confirms SEM reaction mechanism. AX-loaded 
      CA-Mg Fe2O4 NPs are promising for potential applications in biomedical uses.

TI  - Antiplatelet therapy for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: Will it stick?
PG  - e1010240
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010240 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) remains a clinically challenging infection
      despite extensive investigation. Repurposing medications approved for other
      indications is appealing as clinical safety profiles have already been
      established. Ticagrelor, a reversible adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonist
      that prevents platelet aggregation, is indicated for patients suffering from
      acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, some clinical data suggest that patients 
      treated with ticagrelor are less likely to have poor outcomes due to S. aureus
      infection. There are several potential mechanisms by which ticagrelor may affect 
      S. aureus virulence. These include direct antibacterial activity, up-regulation
      of the innate immune system through boosting platelet-mediated S. aureus killing,
      and prevention of S. aureus adhesion to host tissues. In this Pearl, we review
      the clinical data surrounding ticagrelor and infection as well as explore the
      evidence surrounding these proposed mechanisms of action. While more evidence is 
      needed before antiplatelet medications formally become part of the arsenal
      against S. aureus infection, these potential mechanisms represent exciting
      pathways to target in the host/pathogen interface.

TI  - Chiral evasion and stereospecific antifolate resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - e1009855
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009855 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance presents a significant health care crisis. The mutation 
      F98Y in Staphylococcus aureus dihydrofolate reductase (SaDHFR) confers resistance
      to the clinically important antifolate trimethoprim (TMP). Propargyl-linked
      antifolates (PLAs), next generation DHFR inhibitors, are much more resilient than
      TMP against this F98Y variant, yet this F98Y substitution still reduces efficacy 
      of these agents. Surprisingly, differences in the enantiomeric configuration at
      the stereogenic center of PLAs influence the isomeric state of the NADPH
      cofactor. To understand the molecular basis of F98Y-mediated resistance and how
      PLAs' inhibition drives NADPH isomeric states, we used protein design algorithms 
      in the osprey protein design software suite to analyze a comprehensive suite of
      structural, biophysical, biochemical, and computational data. Here, we present a 
      model showing how F98Y SaDHFR exploits a different anomeric configuration of
      NADPH to evade certain PLAs' inhibition, while other PLAs remain unaffected by
      this resistance mechanism.

TI  - DNA-Dependent Binding of Nargenicin to DnaE1 Inhibits Replication in
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.1c00643 [doi]
AB  - Natural products provide a rich source of potential antimicrobials for treating
      infectious diseases for which drug resistance has emerged. Foremost among these
      diseases is tuberculosis. Assessment of the antimycobacterial activity of
      nargenicin, a natural product that targets the replicative DNA polymerase of
      Staphylococcus aureus, revealed that it is a bactericidal genotoxin that induces 
      a DNA damage response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and inhibits growth by 
      blocking the replicative DNA polymerase, DnaE1. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed
      that binding of nargenicin to Mtb DnaE1 requires the DNA substrate such that
      nargenicin is wedged between the terminal base pair and the polymerase and
      occupies the position of both the incoming nucleotide and templating base.
      Comparative analysis across three bacterial species suggests that the activity of
      nargenicin is partly attributable to the DNA binding affinity of the replicative 
      polymerase. This work has laid the foundation for target-led drug discovery
      efforts focused on Mtb DnaE1.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus controls eicosanoid and specialized pro-resolving mediator 
      production via lipoteichoic acid.
LID - 10.1111/imm.13449 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus causes severe infections associated with inflammation, such
      as sepsis or osteomyelitis. Inflammatory processes are regulated by distinct
      lipid mediators (LM) but how their biosynthetic pathways are orchestrated in S.
      aureus infections is elusive. We show that S. aureus strikingly modulates
      pro-inflammatory but also inflammation-resolving LM pathways in murine
      osteomyelitis and osteoclasts as well as in human monocyte-derived macrophages
      (MDM) with different phenotype. Targeted LM metabololipidomics using
      ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed massive
      generation of LM with distinct LM signature profiles in acute and chronic phases 
      of S. aureus-induced murine osteomyelitis in vivo. In human MDM, S. aureus
      elevated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1
      (mPGES-1), but impaired levels of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1), with respective
      changes in LM signature profiles initiated by these enzymes, i.e., elevated PGE2 
      and impaired specialized pro-resolving mediators, along with reduced M2-like
      phenotypic macrophage markers. The cell wall component lipoteichoic acid (LTA)
      mimicked the impact of S. aureus elevating COX-2/mPGES-1 expression via NF-kappaB
      and p38 MAPK signalling in MDM, while the impairment of 15-LOX-1 correlates with 
      reduced expression of Lamtor1. In conclusion, S. aureus dictates LM pathways via 
      LTA resulting in a shift from anti-inflammatory M2-like towards pro-inflammatory 
      M1-like LM signature profiles.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that the combination disinfectant,
      Ortho-phthalaldehyde and benzyldimethyldodecylammonium chloride (ODB), can
      effectively kill a variety of microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli,
      Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. To observe the sporicidal ability
      and mechanism of ODB for spores, Bacillus subtilis spores were used as the
      research object in this experiment. TEM images revealed that ODB destroyed the
      integrity of the coat, cortex, and inner membrane of the spores after 0.5-h
      treatment, and the nuclear material was also broken and exuded after 4-h
      treatment. The broken structure led to the release of dipicolinic acid (DPA) in
      large amount. The results show that B. subtilis spores can be effetely killed by 
      ODB through destroying the structure of the spores.

AB  - Incorporating antimicrobial components into food packaging materials can prevent 
      microbial contamination. Fungus combs could be an alternative source of natural
      antimicrobial agents. In this study, n-hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water
      extracts were obtained from fungus combs isolated from Indomalayan termite
      (Macrotermes gilvus Hagen) mound. Their antibacterial and antifungal activities
      against food spoilage microorganisms including Escherichia coli ATCC 25922,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Aspergillus 
      flavus, and Aspergillus niger were evaluated by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion and
      microdilution. Results showed that ethyl acetate extract formed the largest
      diameter inhibition zone for all tested bacteria and fungi, exhibited
      antibacterial activity against all tested bacteria with minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of 0.39
      and 0.78 mg/mL, respectively, and suppressed A. flavus and A. niger with an MIC
      value of 0.78 mg/mL. This extract contained guaiacol and syringol, which were
      predicted as the main antimicrobial components in fungus comb. n-Hexane extract
      only inhibited Gram-positive bacteria. S. aureus ATCC 25923 was the most
      sensitive to all the extracts, and A. flavus was more sensitive than A. niger.
      All these fungus comb extracts exhibited antimicrobial activity against E. coli
      ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, S. aureus ATCC 25923, A. flavus, and A.
      niger. This study revealed that fungus comb extracts, especially ethyl acetate,
      could be considered as a new antimicrobial agent.

AB  - The hexanic extracts of Hypericum austrobrasiliense, H. caprifoliatum, H.
      denudatum, H. pedersenii and H. polyanthemum, and three isolated dimeric
      acylphloroglucinols (uliginosin B, japonicine A and hyperbrasilol B) were assayed
      for their antimicrobial activity against some Gram-positive and Gram-negative
      bacteria (including resistant strains). These extracts were assayed using the
      disc diffusion test, and the results indicated that the tested species did non
      exhibit activity on the Gram-negative strains. Subsequently, the minimum
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC)
      were measured using the broth dilution technique adopted to macrodillution. The
      most susceptible strains were the MRSA and the S. aureus MLSb. Regarding these
      pathogens, the better MIC values were obtained with the extracts from H.
      austrobrasiliense, H. caprifoliatum and H. pedersenii. The acylphloroglucinols
      uliginosin B and hyperbrasilol B presented the lowest MIC values against
      Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA and S. aureus MLSb resistance.

TI  - Role of PemI in the Staphylococcus aureus PemIK toxin-antitoxin complex: PemI
      controls PemK by acting as a PemK loop mimic.
LID - gkab1288 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkab1288 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a notorious and globally distributed pathogenic
      bacterium. New strategies to develop novel antibiotics based on intrinsic
      bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems have been recently reported. Because TA
      systems are present only in bacteria and not in humans, these distinctive systems
      are attractive targets for developing antibiotics with new modes of action. S.
      aureus PemIK is a type II TA system, comprising the toxin protein PemK and the
      labile antitoxin protein PemI. Here, we determined the crystal structures of both
      PemK and the PemIK complex, in which PemK is neutralized by PemI. Our biochemical
      approaches, including fluorescence quenching and polarization assays, identified 
      Glu20, Arg25, Thr48, Thr49, and Arg84 of PemK as being important for RNase
      function. Our study indicates that the active site and RNA-binding residues of
      PemK are covered by PemI, leading to unique conformational changes in PemK
      accompanied by repositioning of the loop between beta1 and beta2. These changes
      can interfere with RNA binding by PemK. Overall, PemK adopts particular open and 
      closed forms for precise neutralization by PemI. This structural and functional
      information on PemIK will contribute to the discovery and development of novel
      antibiotics in the form of peptides or small molecules inhibiting direct binding 
      between PemI and PemK.

TI  - The efficacy of bactrim in reducing surgical site infections after spine surgery.
PG  - 100095
LID - 10.1016/j.xnsj.2021.100095 [doi]
AB  - Background: Previous studies show an increasing incidence of gram-negative
      organisms in surgical site infections after spine surgery. This study is looking 
      for the association of the post-operative prophylactic use of Bactrim and the
      gram-negative surgical site infection after lumbar spine surgery. Methods:
      Patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery between August 2010 and December 2019
      at the institution were retrospectively reviewed. Results: There were 11
      infections out of 511 cases where no oral antibiotics were given (2.2%). There
      were 2 infections out of 84 cases where Bactrim was given (2.4%). This was not
      statistically significant (P=0.89). The organisms cultured from the no oral
      antibiotic group were 8 cases of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
      (MSSA), 1 case of E. coli, 1 case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 case of MRSA. The 
      organisms cultured from the Bactrim group were 1 case of MRSA, and 1 case of
      combined Citrobacter freundii and methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
      (MSSA). Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference in SSIs
      when Bactrim was given for two weeks after surgery. However, two subjects who
      developed infection from the Bactrim group were paradoxically affected by
      gram-negative and antibiotic resistant organisms. So, clinicians should be
      judicious in their use of oral antibiotics after spine surgery. Level of
      Evidence: III.

AB  - Selection for resistance to azithromycin (AZM) and other antibiotics such as
      tetracyclines and lincosamides remains a concern with long-term AZM use for
      treatment of chronic lung diseases (CLD). We investigated the impact of 48 weeks 
      of AZM on the carriage and antibiotic resistance of common respiratory bacteria
      among children with HIV-associated CLD. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and sputa were 
      collected at baseline, 48 and 72 weeks from participants with HIV-associated CLD 
      randomised to receive weekly AZM or placebo for 48 weeks and followed
      post-intervention until 72 weeks. The primary outcomes were prevalence and
      antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Staphylococcus aureus
      (SA), Haemophilus influenzae (HI) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MC) at these
      timepoints. Mixed-effects logistic regression and Fisher's exact test were used
      to compare carriage and resistance, respectively. Of 347 (174 AZM, 173 placebo)
      participants (median age 15 years (IQR 13-18), female 49%), NP carriage was
      significantly lower in the AZM (n=159) compared to placebo (n=153) arm for SP
      (18% versus 41%, p<0.001), HI (7% versus 16%, p=0.01) and MC (4% versus 11%,
      p=0.02); SP resistance to AZM (62% (18 out of 29) versus 13% (8 out of 63),
      p<0.0001) or tetracycline (60% (18 out of 29) versus 21% (13 out of 63),
      p<0.0001) was higher in the AZM arm. Carriage of SA resistant to AZM (91% (31 out
      of 34) versus 3% (1 out of 31), p<0.0001), tetracycline (35% (12 out of 34)
      versus 13% (4 out of 31), p=0.05) and clindamycin (79% (27 out of 34) versus 3%
      (1 out of 31), p<0.0001) was also significantly higher in the AZM arm and
      persisted at 72 weeks. Similar findings were observed for sputa. The persistence 
      of antibiotic resistance and its clinical relevance for future infectious
      episodes requiring treatment needs further investigation.

LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2021.790686 [doi]
AB  - Because of the excessive use of antibiotics, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA) has become prevalent worldwide. Moreover, the formation of S.
      aureus biofilms often cause persistence and relapse of infections. Thus, the
      discovery of antibiotics with excellent antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities
      is urgently needed. In the present study, eltrombopag (EP), a classic
      thrombopoietin receptor agonist, exhibited potential antimicrobial activity
      against S. aureus and its biofilms. Through our mechanistic studies, EP was found
      to interfere with proton motive force in S. aureus. The in vivo anti-infective
      efficacy of EP was further confirmed in the wound infection model, thigh
      infection model and peritonitis model by MRSA infection. In addition, the
      cytotoxicity of EP against mammalian cells and the in vivo toxicity of EP in
      animal models were not observed at the tested concentrations. Collectively, these
      results indicate that EP could be considered a potential novel antimicrobial
      agent against recalcitrant infections caused by MRSA.

      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: Synthesis, optimization, and
      evaluation.
PG  - 58-69
LID - 10.1002/elsc.202100050 [doi]
AB  - Curcumin is a polyphenolic molecule with antibacterial, antioxidant,
      anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. This study aimed to prepare
      nanocurcumin by encapsulating in biopolymers to improve its stability,
      bioavailability, water-solubility, antibacterial efficiency against
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Three effective variables of
      curcumin concentration, polymer concentration, and water volume on
      curcumin-loaded polymer nanoparticles, were optimized. The average size of
      polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polyethyleneimine (PEI)
      nanoparticles were obtained 75.2, 77.1, 86.4 nm, respectively. The nanoparticles 
      had a spherical shape, a smooth and uniform surface morphology. The MIC of PAA,
      PVA, and PEI nanoparticles was 0.480, 0.390, and 0.340 mg/mL, respectively and
      the MIC of PAA, PVA, and PEI combined with methicillin was 0.330, 0.260, and
      0.200 mg/mL, respectively. According to the results, curcumin-loaded PEI
      nanoparticles had the highest inhibitory effect against methicillin-resistant S. 
      aureus among the synthesized nanoparticles. The results showed that solvent
      volume, polymer concentration and curcumin concentration had a significant effect
      on particle size. The inhibitory properties of curcumin nanoparticles
      significantly increased due to the smaller particle size and increased
      penetration into the bacterium. Curcumin-loaded nanoparticles can be promising
      drug carriers for the treatment of infections, cancer, and other diseases.

      Infections in Public Hospitals in Northern Jordan.
PG  - 359-366
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S350406 [doi]
AB  - Background: Surgical site infections are hospital-acquired, vary from one
      hospital to another, and can cause significant postoperative morbidity,
      mortality, and prolonged hospital stay. Objective: The main aim of the study was 
      to identify the bacterial pathogens associated with surgical site infections and 
      their antibiotic susceptibility in a public hospital in northern Jordan. Methods:
      Postsurgical wound samples were collected and processed in a microbiology
      laboratory using standard microbiological techniques. Antibiotic susceptibility
      tests were performed using 13 antibiotics covering the gram-positive and
      gram-negative bacteria using the disc diffusion test. Results: The bacterial
      species that were identified in this study include Escherichia coli 8 (29%),
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 (11%), Proteus mirabilis 1 (3.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae
      4 (14%), Salmonella enterica 2 (7%), Staphylococcus aureus 8 (29%),
      Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 (3.5%), and Streptococcus pyogenes 1 (4%). The
      antibiotic profiles of these bacteria showed high resistance. The MAR indices
      showed that 17 of 28 bacteria isolated were above 0.2 indicating high resistance.
      Conclusion: Resistant bacteria are becoming more dominant in wound infections
      with a high prevalence of multidrug resistant isolates. Hospital disinfection and
      treatment protocols regarding the use of antibiotics should be practiced
      vigorously and monitored regularly to combat resistance.

AB  - The essential oil of Elsholtzia beddomei C. B. Clarke ex Hook. f. was
      investigated for its chemical composition and tested for antioxidant and
      antimicrobial activities. The E. beddomei essential oil was extracted using
      hydrodistillation for 4 h (yield of 1.38% w/w). Forty-three volatile compounds
      were identified in the E. beddomei essential oil, including linalool (83.67%),
      perillaldehyde (4.68%), neral (3.68%), perillene (1.65%), E-caryophyllene
      (1.55%), and alpha-zingiberene (1.06%) as the major compounds. The antioxidant
      activity of the E. beddomei essential oil was determined using
      2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical and
      2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical cation
      scavenging activity. The IC50 values calculated using the DPPH and ABTS methods
      were 148.31 and 172.22 microg/mL, respectively. In addition, using disc diffusion
      and broth microdilution methods, the antimicrobial activities of the E. beddomei 
      essential oil against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter
      aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, 
      and Candida albicans were evaluated. The E. beddomei essential oil possessed an
      inhibitory effect with the minimum inhibitory concentration in the range of
      31.25-250.00 microg/mL among these pathogens. The results indicated that E.
      beddomei essential oil is an alternative raw material of food, and medicinal
      products for use in pharmaceutical applications.

AB  - Bacterial cellulose (BC) is an ecofriendly biopolymer with diverse commercial
      applications. Its use is limited by the capacity of bacterial production strains 
      and cost of the medium. Mining for novel organisms with well-optimized growth
      conditions will be important for the adoption of BC. In this study, a novel
      BC-producing strain was isolated from rotten fruit samples and identified as
      Lactiplantibacillus plantarum from 16S rRNA sequencing. Culture conditions were
      optimized for supporting maximal BC production using one variable at a time,
      Plackett-Burman design, and Box Behnken design approaches. Results indicated that
      a modified Yamanaka medium supported the highest BC yield (2.7 g/l), and that
      yeast extract, MgSO4, and pH were the most significant variables influencing BC
      production. After optimizing the levels of these variables through Box Behnken
      design, BC yield was increased to 4.51 g/l. The drug delivery capacity of the
      produced BC membrane was evaluated through fabrication with sodium alginate and
      gentamycin antibiotic at four different concentrations. All membranes (normal and
      fabricated) were characterized by scanning electron microscope, Fourier
      transform-infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and mechanical properties.
      The antimicrobial activity of prepared composites was evaluated by using six
      human pathogens and revealed potent antibacterial activity against Escherichia
      coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans,
      with no detected activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans.

TI  - Mucosa-Associated Invariant T Cell Hypersensitivity to Staphylococcus aureus
      Leukocidin ED and Its Modulation by Activation.
LID - ji2100912 [pii]
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2100912 [doi]
AB  - Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells recognize bacterial riboflavin
      metabolite Ags presented by MHC class Ib-related protein (MR1) and play important
      roles in immune control of microbes that synthesize riboflavin. This includes the
      pathobiont Staphylococcus aureus, which can also express a range of virulence
      factors, including the secreted toxin leukocidin ED (LukED). In this study, we
      found that human MAIT cells are hypersensitive to LukED-mediated lysis and lost
      on exposure to the toxin, leaving a T cell population devoid of MAIT cells. The
      cytolytic effect of LukED on MAIT cells was rapid and occurred at toxin
      concentrations lower than those required for toxicity against conventional T
      cells. Furthermore, this coincided with high MAIT cell expression of CCR5, and
      loss of these cells was efficiently inhibited by the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc.
      Interestingly, exposure and preactivation of MAIT cells with IL-12 and IL-18, or 
      activation via TCR triggering, partially protected from LukED toxicity.
      Furthermore, analysis of NK cells indicated that LukED targeted the mature
      cytotoxic CD57(+) NK cell subset in a CCR5-independent manner. Overall, these
      results indicate that LukED efficiently eliminates immune cells that can respond 
      rapidly to S. aureus in an innate fashion without the need for clonal expansion, 
      and that MAIT cells are exceptionally vulnerable to this toxin. Thus, the
      findings support a model where LukED secretion may allow S. aureus to avoid
      recognition by the rapid cell-mediated responses mediated by MAIT cells and NK
      cells.

TI  - Rationalising empirical antibiotics for bloodstream infections: A retrospective
      study at a South African district-level hospital.
PG  - 13520
AB  - BACKGROUND: Incorrect empirical antibiotic therapy is one of the factors that
      contribute to poor clinical outcomes and the development of antimicrobial
      resistance. Knowledge of the local infectious disease burden and antibiotic
      resistance patterns can assist with development of strategies, updating of
      guidelines and subsequent improvement in initial empirical therapy. OBJECTIVES:
      To determine whether the empirical antibiotic choice for treatment of septic
      episodes at a district-level hospital was appropriate according to national
      guidelines, and to describe the epidemiological features of the septic episode
      population being studied and depict their antibiotic susceptibility profile.
      METHODS: This was a retrospective, descriptive study of adult inpatients with
      bloodstream infections at Karl Bremer Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa.
      Laboratory and clinical data were obtained and analysed for the period 1 July
      2017 - 30 June 2018. Septic episodes were subdivided into community-acquired
      bloodstream infection (CABSI) and hospital-acquired bloodstream infection (HABSI)
      study populations, and empirical antibiotics for both groups were assessed and
      compared with the adult Standard Treatment Guidelines and Essential Medicines
      List for South Africa, Hospital Level Care, 2015 edition (STG and EML). RESULTS: 
      Our study sample consisted of 184 septic episodes, isolated from 176 patients.
      Nearly half of the septic episodes (49.5%) were hospital acquired. Overall
      guideline adherence in the CABSI population was 88%, compared with 58% in the
      HABSI population. The reasons for guideline non-adherence in the CABSI population
      were lack of source-appropriate empirical antibiotics (n=7) and septic episodes
      where empirical antibiotics were indicated but not prescribed (n=4), while in the
      HABSI group the main reason was that the patients were treated by
      community-acquired standards (n=30; 33.0%). The in-hospital mortality rate for a 
      septic episode in this study was 38%. Considering the typical first-line
      antibiotics used, 77.3% of CABSIs were found to be susceptible to co-amoxiclav
      (n=75) and 59.8% to ceftriaxone (n=58). With the exclusion of
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates 
      as confounders, HABSIs had a susceptibility of 86% to the piperacillin/tazobactam
      plus amikacin combination, 81% to ertapenem, 90% to imipenem and 93% to
      meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates poor guideline adherence in
      HABSIs, emphasising the importance of distinguishing between CABSIs and HABSIs.
      The empirical antibiotics advised by the STG and EML were found to be appropriate
      in the majority of septic episodes. Future revision and improvement of
      prescribing practices can assist in rationalising empirical antibiotic decisions.

TI  - Surface-Charge-Switchable and Size-Transformable Thermosensitive Nanocomposites
      for Chemo-Photothermal Eradication of Bacterial Biofilms in Vitro and in Vivo.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.1c24229 [doi]
AB  - The appearance of multidrug-resistant bacteria and their biofilms presents a
      serious threat to modern medical systems. Herein, we fabricated a novel
      gold-nanorod-based chemo-photothermal-integrated antimicrobial platform with
      surface-charge-switchable and near-infrared (NIR)-induced size-transformable
      activities that show an enhanced killing efficiency against methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in both planktonic and biofilm phenotypes. The
      nanocomposites are prepared by in situ copolymerization using N-isopropyl
      acrylamide (NIPAM), acrylic acid (AA), and N-allylmethylamine (MAA) as monomers
      on the surfaces of gold nanorods (GNRs). Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is loaded onto
      polymer shells of nanocomposites with a loading content of 9.8%. The negatively
      charged nanocomposites switch to positive upon passive accumulation at the
      infectious sites, which promotes deep biofilm penetration and bacterial adhesion 
      of the nanoparticles. Subsequently, NIR irradiation triggers the nanocomposites
      to rapidly shrink in volume, further increasing the depth of biofilm penetration.
      The NIR-triggered, ultrafast volume shrinkage causes an instant release of CIP on
      the bacterial surface, realizing the synergistic benefits of chemo-photothermal
      therapy. Both in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrate that drug-loaded
      nanocomposites could eradicate clinical MRSA biofilms. Taken together, the
      multifunctional chemo-photothermal-integrated antimicrobial platform, as
      designed, is a promising antimicrobial agent against MRSA infections.

      caused by the Staphylococcus Aureus bacteria, the clinical presentation and
      diagnostic results in all three was different. This case report presents various 
      courses of the same disease, each with a slightly different treatment and
      outcome. Although the incidence of osteomyelitis is decreasing, it is of great
      importance to consider osteomyelitis as a diagnosis in pediatric bone complaints 
      so that it can be recognized and treated in time to decrease the risk of bone
      destruction and growth disorders.

TI  - Inactivation of the Response Regulator AgrA Has a Pleiotropic Effect on Biofilm
      Formation, Pathogenesis and Stress Response in Staphylococcus lugdunensis.
PG  - e0159821
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01598-21 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus that emerges as
      an important opportunistic pathogen. However, little is known about the
      regulation underlying the transition from commensal to virulent state. Based on
      knowledge of S. aureus virulence, we suspected that the agr quorum sensing system
      may be an important determinant for the pathogenicity of S. lugdunensis. We
      investigated the functions of the transcriptional regulator AgrA using the agrA
      deletion mutant. AgrA played a role in cell pigmentation: DeltaargA mutant
      colonies were white while the parental strains were slightly yellow. Compared
      with the wild-type strain, the DeltaargA mutant was affected in its ability to
      form biofilm and was less able to survive in mice macrophages. Moreover, the
      growth of DeltaagrA was significantly reduced by the addition of 10% NaCl or 0.4 
      mM H2O2 and its survival after 2 h in the presence of 1 mM H2O2 was more than
      10-fold reduced. To explore the mechanisms involved beyond these phenotypes, the 
      DeltaagrA proteome and transcriptome were characterized by mass spectrometry and 
      RNA-Seq. We found that AgrA controlled several virulence factors as well as
      stress-response factors, which are well correlated with the reduced resistance of
      the DeltaagrA mutant to osmotic and oxidative stresses. These results were not
      the consequence of the deregulation of RNAIII of the agr system, since no
      phenotype or alteration of the proteomic profile has been observed for the
      DeltaRNAIII mutant. Altogether, our results highlighted that the AgrA regulator
      of S. lugdunensis played a key role in its ability to become pathogenic.
      IMPORTANCE Although belonging to the natural human skin flora, Staphylococcus
      lugdunensis is recognized as a particularly aggressive and destructive pathogen. 
      This study aimed to characterize the role of the response regulator AgrA, which
      is a component of the quorum-sensing agr system and known to be a major element
      in the regulation of pathogenicity and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus
      aureus. In the present study, we showed that, contrary to S. aureus, the agrA
      deletion mutant produced less biofilm. Inactivation of agrA conferred a white
      colony phenotype and impacted S. lugdunensis in its ability to survive in mice
      macrophages and to cope with osmotic and oxidative stresses. By global proteomic 
      and transcriptomic approaches, we identified the AgrA regulon, bringing molecular
      bases underlying the observed phenotypes. Together, our data showed the
      importance of AgrA in the opportunistic pathogenic behavior of S. lugdunensis
      allowing it to be considered as an interesting therapeutic target.

TI  - Screening for Highly Transduced Genes in Staphylococcus aureus Revealed Both
      Lateral and Specialized Transduction.
PG  - e0242321
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.02423-21 [doi]
AB  - Bacteriophage-mediated transduction of bacterial DNA is a major route of
      horizontal gene transfer in the human pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus.
      Transduction involves the packaging of bacterial DNA by viruses and enables the
      transmission of virulence and resistance genes between cells. To learn more about
      transduction in S. aureus, we searched a transposon mutant library for genes and 
      mutations that enhanced transfer mediated by the temperate phage, varphi11. Using
      a novel screening strategy, we performed multiple rounds of transduction of
      transposon mutant pools selecting for an antibiotic resistance marker within the 
      transposon element. When determining the locations of transferred mutations, we
      found that the screen had selected for just 1 or 2 transposon mutant(s) within
      each pool of 96 mutants. Subsequent analysis showed that the position of the
      transposon, rather than the inactivation of bacterial genes, was responsible for 
      the phenotype. Interestingly, from multiple rounds, we identified a pattern of
      transduction that encompassed mobile genetic elements as well as chromosomal
      regions both upstream and downstream of the phage integration site. The latter
      was confirmed by DNA sequencing of purified phage lysates. Importantly,
      transduction frequencies were lower for phage lysates obtained by phage infection
      rather than induction. Our results confirmed previous reports of lateral
      transduction of bacterial DNA downstream of the integrated phage but also
      indicated a novel form of specialized transduction of DNA upstream of the phage. 
      These findings illustrated the complexity of transduction processes and increased
      our understanding of the mechanisms by which phages transfer bacterial DNA.
      IMPORTANCE Horizontal transfer of DNA between bacterial cells contributes to the 
      spread of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes in human pathogens. For
      Staphylococcus aureus, bacterial viruses play a major role in facilitating the
      horizontal transfer. These viruses, termed bacteriophages, can transfer bacterial
      DNA between cells by a process known as transduction, which despite its
      importance is only poorly characterized. Here, we employed a transposon mutant
      library to investigate transduction in S. aureus. We showed that the genomic
      location of bacterial DNA relative to where bacteriophages integrated into that
      bacterial genome affected how frequently that DNA was transduced. Based on serial
      transduction of transposon mutant pools and direct sequencing of bacterial DNA in
      bacteriophage particles, we demonstrated both lateral and specialized
      transduction. The use of mutant libraries to investigate the genomic patterns of 
      bacterial DNA transferred between cells could help us understand how horizontal
      transfer influences virulence and resistance development.

TI  - Comparison of Genetic Features and Evolution of Global and Chinese Strains of
      Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus ST22.
PG  - e0203721
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.02037-21 [doi]
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sequence type (ST) 22,
      especially the epidemic MRSA-15 (EMRSA-15), has been one of the most important
      disease-causing clones transmitting rapidly within and between hospitals
      globally. However, the genetic features and evolution of Chinese MRSA ST22 remain
      to be determined. Herein, we performed comparative genomics analysis of 12 ST22
      community-associated (CA) MRSA isolates from China with 9 Chinese ST22 CA-MSSA
      isolates and 284 ST22 genomes from global sources, to clarify the genotypic
      features and potential transmission of MRSA ST22 strains isolated in China.
      Phylogenetic reconstruction and time estimation suggested that the Chinese
      subclade emerged around 2006, and the ST22-SCCmec V clone may have evolved from
      the native ST22-MSSA clone rather than spread from other regions, indicating that
      the Chinese ST22-MRSA-V clone is independent of the EMRSA-15 and Gaza clone, with
      differences in lukSF-PV and tsst-1 carriage. Virulence assays suggested that the 
      ST22-MRSA clone was highly virulent, displaying higher or similar virulence
      potential as MSSA ST22 predecessors and the epidemic USA300 and ST22-MSSA.
      However, two nonsense mutations caused by a frameshift in agrC were identified in
      two ST22-MSSA isolates, resulting in a significant attenuation of virulence.
      RT-qPCR also demonstrated that the high virulence potential of these ST22 strains
      may be attributed to elevated expression of agr. This study provides insight into
      the epidemiology of the novel and highly virulent CA-MRSA ST22 clones. IMPORTANCE
      Staphylococcus aureus sequence type 22 (ST22) is the main HA-MRSA clone spreading
      in Europe. It has strong capacity to supplant and replace other formerly epidemic
      MRSA clones. Previous work has described genotypic characteristics of ST22
      belonging to EMRSA-15 and Gaza clone; however, the genetic feature and virulence 
      potential of Chinese spread of ST22 strains are still limited. We conducted a
      detailed analysis of genomic evolution of global ST22 strains, to clarify the
      genotypic features and potential transmission of MRSA ST22 strains isolated from 
      China. Our results suggested that the Chinese subclade is highly virulent, and
      emerged around 2006. We also demonstrated that the ST22-SCCmec V may have evolved
      from the native ST22-MSSA clone rather than spread from other regions, and the
      high virulence potential of these ST22 strains may be attributed to the high
      expression of agr based on the results of virulence assays of Chinese ST22
      clones. Our findings are of great importance for providing insights into the
      epidemiology and pathogenicity of global and Chinese ST22 clones.

TI  - Sequencing Independent Molecular Typing of Staphylococcus aureus Isolates:
      Approach for Infection Control and Clonal Characterization.
PG  - e0181721
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01817-21 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a major bacterial human pathogen that causes a wide
      variety of clinical manifestations. The main aim of the presented study was to
      determine and optimize a novel sequencing independent approach that enables
      molecular typing of S. aureus isolates and elucidates the transmission of
      emergent clones between patients. In total, 987 S. aureus isolates including both
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA)
      isolates were used to evaluate the novel typing approach combining
      high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) genes
      (mini-MLST) and spa gene (spa-HRM). The novel approach's discriminatory ability
      was evaluated by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The clonal relatedness of tested 
      isolates was set by the BURP and BURST approach using spa and MLST data,
      respectively. Mini-MLST classified the S. aureus isolates into 38 clusters,
      followed by spa-HRM classifying the isolates into 101 clusters. The WGS proved
      HRM-based methods to effectively differentiate between related S. aureus
      isolates. Visualizing evolutionary relationships among different spa-types
      provided by the BURP algorithm showed comparable results to MLST/mini-MLST clonal
      clusters. We proved that the combination of mini-MLST and spa-HRM is rapid,
      reproducible, and cost-efficient. In addition to high discriminatory ability, the
      correlation between spa evolutionary relationships and mini-MLST clustering
      allows the variability in population structure to be monitored. IMPORTANCE Rapid 
      and cost-effective molecular typing tools for Staphylococcus aureus
      epidemiological applications such as transmission tracking, source attribution
      and outbreak investigations are highly desirable. High-resolution melting based
      methods are effective alternative to those based on sequencing. Their good
      reproducibility and easy performance allow prospective typing of large set of
      isolates while reaching great discriminatory power. In this study, we established
      a new epidemiological approach to S. aureus typing. This scheme has the potential
      to greatly improve epidemiological investigations of S. aureus.

TI  - Transparent Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and Antibacterial Silver Oxide Coatings.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.1c20872 [doi]
AB  - Transparent antimicrobial coatings can maintain the aesthetic appeal of surfaces 
      and the functionality of a touch-screen while adding the benefit of reducing
      disease transmission. We fabricated an antimicrobial coating of silver oxide
      particles in a silicate matrix on glass. The matrix was grown by a modified
      Stober sol-gel process with vapor-phase water and ammonia. A coating on glass
      with 2.4 mg of Ag2O per mm(2) caused a reduction of 99.3% of SARS-CoV-2 and
      >99.5% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus compared to the uncoated glass after 
      1 h. We envisage that screen protectors with transparent antimicrobial coatings
      will find particular application to communal touch-screens, such as in
      supermarkets and other check-out or check-in facilities where a number of
      individuals utilize the same touch-screen in a short interval.

TI  - "On-Demand" Antimicrobial Photodynamic Activity through Supramolecular
      Photosensitizers Built with Rose Bengal and (p-Vinylbenzyl)triethylammomium
      Polycation Derivatives.
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.1c00596 [doi]
AB  - The antimicrobial photodynamic activity (aPDA) in fungal and bacterial strains of
      supramolecular adducts formed between the anionic photosensitizer (PS) Rose
      Bengal (RB(2-)) and aromatic polycations derived from
      (p-vinylbenzyl)triethylammonium chloride was evaluated. Stable supramolecular
      adducts with dissociation constants Kd approximately 5 muM showed
      photosensitizing properties suitable for generating singlet oxygen (PhiDelta =
      0.5 +/- 0.1) with the added advantage of improving the photostability of the
      xanthenic dye. However, the aPDA of both free and supramolecular RB(2-) was
      highly dependent on the type of microorganism treated, indicating the importance 
      of specific interactions between the different cell wall structures of the
      microbe and the PSs. Indeed, in the case of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, 
      the aPDA of molecular and supramolecular PSs was highly effective. Instead, in
      the case of Gram-negative Escherichia coli, only the RB(2-):polycation adducts
      showed aPDA, while RB(2-) alone was inefficient, but in the case of Candida
      tropicalis, the opposite behavior was observed. Therefore, the present results
      indicate the potential of supramolecular chemistry to obtain aPDA a la carte
      depending on the target microbe and the PS properties.

TI  - Infectious complications and optimising infection prevention for children with
      cochlear implants.
LID - 10.1111/jpc.15889 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To describe the clinical epidemiology of children receiving cochlear
      implants, as well as the management and outcomes of cochlear implant infections
      and adherence to infection prevention measures. METHODS: A retrospective
      observational study was conducted in children </=18 years who received cochlear
      implants in Western Australia's tertiary paediatric hospital. Information was
      obtained from medical and laboratory records regarding demographics, indication
      for implant, implant infection and preoperative Staphylococcus aureus
      screening/decolonisation. Immunisation history was examined using the Australian 
      Immunisation Register. RESULTS: Overall, 118 children received cochlear implants,
      with 158 devices inserted (599 cochlear implant insertion-years). An implant
      infection rate of 3.8% (6/158) was identified during the study period (four
      pneumococcal and two community-acquired methicillin resistant S. aureus
      infections). All required surgical management, with an overall median duration of
      antibiotic therapy of 37 days (interquartile range (IQR) 29-48) and median length
      of stay of 8 days (IQR 8-9.5). All devices were retained and there were no
      relapses or deaths. Half of the children who developed cochlear implant
      infections (50%, 3/6) were up-to-date with additional pneumococcal vaccinations
      and no children (0%, 0/118) received S. aureus screening/decolonisation before
      implant insertion. CONCLUSIONS: Favourable outcomes were achieved with cochlear
      implant retention; however, the treatment was burdensome for families. We
      demonstrate significant scope to improve adherence to existing infection
      prevention strategies and provide direction for optimising preventative measures 
      in the future. These include ensuring parental education, additional pneumococcal
      vaccinations and S. aureus decolonisation which are delivered as an infection
      prevention bundle to the growing population of infants receiving cochlear
      implants.

      Quality of Milk.
PG  - 454-462
LID - 10.17113/ftb.59.04.21.7179 [doi]
AB  - Research background: The application of high power ultrasound combined with a
      slightly increased temperature on raw cow's milk, skimmed cow's milk and skimmed 
      cow's milk that passed the bactofugation process was analysed. We combined
      ultrasound with bactofugation of milk to achieve the microbiological accuracy
      that is equivalent to pasteurization. Experimental approach: The milk samples
      (200 mL) were treated for 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 min with high-power ultrasound (200 
      and 400 W) with a frequency of 24 kHz. The treatments were conducted with a
      constant duty cycle of 100%. Temperatures during the treatments were 20 and 55
      degrees C. The somatic cell count of the aerobic mesophilic bacteria, as well the
      number of Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus cells
      were analysed. Results and conclusions: From the perspective of the reduction of 
      the total count of bacteria, the best result was achieved by high-power
      ultrasound at 400 W treated for 10 min. High reduction of Enterobacteriaceae, E. 
      coli and S. aureus cells was achieved with ultrasound treatment of raw, skimmed
      and skimmed cow's milk that passed the bactofugation with a power of 200 and 400 
      W regardless of the treatment time. Novelty and scientific contribution: This
      work combines bactofugation and high-power ultrasound for the inactivation of
      microoganisms. This combination was used at a slightly increased temperature (up 
      to 55 degrees C), which is much more economical than pasteurization, while it
      preserves the sensory and physicochemical properties of milk.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a significant causative
      agent of hospital-acquired infections. We characterized MRSA isolated from August
      2012 to July 2015 from Thammasat University Hospital. Genotypic characterization 
      of MRSA SCCmec type II and III isolates were scrutinized by whole genome
      sequencing (WGS). The WGS data revealed that the MRSA SCCmec type II isolates
      belonged to ST764 previously reported mainly in Japan. All of tested isolates
      contained ACME Type II', SaPIn2, SaPIn3, seb, interrupted SA1320, and had a
      virulence gene profile similar to Japan MRSA ST764. Rigorous surveillance of MRSA
      strains is imperative in Thailand to arrest its potential spread.

LID - 10.11406/rinketsu.63.31 [doi]
AB  - Monoclonal gammopathy of undermined significance (MGUS) is usually asymptomatic, 
      and untreated follow-up is the standard treatment. However, MGUS progresses to
      multiple myeloma or related malignancy at a frequency of 1.5% per year. It is
      sometimes difficult to diagnose the progression of the disease via usual
      examinations. We herein report a case wherein rapid renal dysfunction led to a
      diagnosis of disease progression to multiple myeloma in a patient with MGUS that 
      was asymptomatic for a long time. A 66-year-old woman developed rapid renal
      dysfunction requiring continuous hemodiafiltration 8 years after the diagnosis of
      IgA-kappa type MGUS. A complete examination led to the diagnosis of IgA-kappa
      type multiple myeloma. Chemotherapy was not effective, and she died due to sepsis
      on the 19th day of admission. A pathological autopsy revealed systemic
      amyloidosis and multiple abscesses positive for Staphylococcus aureus. An
      abnormal free light chain kappa/lambda ratio and M protein other than IgG are
      reportedly risk factors of disease progression of MGUS. In cases with these risk 
      factors, it is important to always keep in mind the possibility of disease
      progression and to monitor the patient carefully for an early diagnosis.

TI  - Automated Susceptibility Testing with Vitek 2 Compared to MicroScan Reduces
      Vancomycin Alternative Therapy for Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      Bacteremia.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Variability in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with automated 
      susceptibility testing instruments may influence methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
      the difference in vancomycin MIC values and the impact on vancomycin alternative 
      therapy for MRSA bacteremia using the MicroScan and Vitek 2 automated systems.
      METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter cohort study of adult patients with
      MRSA bacteremia. Patients were stratified by susceptibility testing with
      MicroScan (May 2013-December 2016) or Vitek 2 (June 2017-February 2020). The
      primary outcome was vancomycin alternative therapy use. Secondary endpoints
      included MRSA MIC, 30-day mortality, 30 and 90-day readmission, and hospital
      length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: A total of 193 patients were included for
      analysis: 89 in the MicroScan group and 104 in the Vitek 2 group. Vancomycin
      alternative therapy use was higher in the MicroScan compared to the Vitek 2 group
      (56.2% vs. 20.2%, p<0.0001). Median MIC value was 2 mg/L and 1 mg/L for MicroScan
      and Vitek 2, respectively (p<0.0001). Median hospital LOS was shorter in the
      Vitek 2 period (16 vs. 12 days, p=0.02). Thirty-day mortality (10.1% vs. 7.7%,
      p=0.555) and 90-day readmission (34.8% vs. 29.8%, p=0.457) did not significantly 
      differ between MicroScan and Vitek 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Vitek 2 use was
      associated with lower reported vancomycin MICs and less use of vancomycin
      alternative therapy.

AB  - Metal organic framework (MOF)-nanocages (MOF-NCs) in the form of zinc-based
      nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized as drug carriers for the purpose of wound
      healing. The prepared NCs (single and bi-metallic with silver-MOF) were based on 
      zinc and they were loaded with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as a model drug which
      accelerates wound healing. The NCs were then investigated by several
      characterization techniques such as XRD, TEM, FTIR and BET surface area.
      Furthermore, the release behavior of the loaded ascorbic acid from the developed 
      NCs was measured in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). NCs antibacterial activity
      was tested against strain of gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC- 
      29213, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC-19615 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC-6633),
      gram-negative bacteria strain (Pseudomonas aeruginosaATCC-27853and Escherichia
      coli ATCC-25922) and fungi (Candida albicans ATCC-10231).The physicochemical
      features of the NCs were confirmed by the results obtained from XRD and FTIR
      measurements. The particle size of the NCs was confirmed to be in the range of
      30-50nm. Prolonged drug release that was combined with impressive antibacterial
      activities, and good wound healing rates were also recognized for the zinc based 
      NCs in comparison to commonly used Ag NPs. It is concluded that the current NCs
      are potentially suitable for wound healing and drug delivery applications.

TI  - Impact of Empiric Linezolid for Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections on Duration of
      Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus-Active Therapy Empiric Linezolid Use 
      for Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections.
LID - 10.1089/sur.2021.329 [doi]
AB  - Background: Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) require prompt surgical
      debridement and antimicrobial therapy. Indicated antimicrobial therapy involves
      broad-spectrum coverage against common pathogens and toxin inhibition. Linezolid 
      provides both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) coverage and
      toxin inhibition, however, there is limited evidence evaluating its role in
      empiric treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of
      empiric linezolid use for NSTIs on the total duration of MRSA-active therapy.
      Patients and Methods: This retrospective, single-center study included adult
      surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients treated with empiric vancomycin and
      clindamycin or linezolid along with gram-negative and anaerobe coverage for
      NSTIs. The primary end point of this study was the duration of MRSA-active
      therapy. Secondary end points included ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS;
      days), new-onset acute kidney injury (AKI), and Clostridioides difficile
      infection (CDI). Results: There were 21 patients in the vancomycin/clindamycin
      cohort and 28 patients in the linezolid cohort. The average duration of
      vancomycin was 3.9 days versus 2.9 days of linezolid (p = 0.04). The average
      hospital LOS for the vancomycin/clindamycin cohort was somewhat longer than the
      linezolid cohort, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 
      0.07), and the incidence of new-onset AKI during hospitalization was higher in
      the vancomycin/clindamycin cohort (38.1% vs. 0%; p < 0.001). No differences were 
      observed for ICU LOS or CDI. Conclusions: Empiric linezolid use for NSTI was
      associated with one less day of MRSA-active therapy and lower incidence of
      new-onset AKI during hospitalization. Linezolid was a safe and effective
      alternative to vancomycin/clindamycin for empiric treatment of NSTIs.

TI  - Highly flexible hydrogel dressing with efficient antibacterial, antioxidative,
      and wound healing performances.
LID - 10.1039/d1bm02010b [doi]
AB  - Bacterial induced wound infection is very common in real life, but the abuse of
      antibiotics means that is poses a potential threat to human health. The
      development of non-antibiotic type antibacterial materials appears to be of
      importance. Herein, a microenvironment-responsive and biodegradable hydrogel
      complex, consisting of an acid-degradable antibacterial hydrogel and a hydrogen
      peroxide (H2O2)-responsive polymer/gold hybrid film with photothermal conversion 
      ability was constructed based on polyethylenimine (PEI), polyethylene glycol
      (PEG), hexachlorocyclic triphosphonitrile (HCCP), and gold nanoparticles. The
      resultant hydrogel showed excellent adhesion to various surfaces, whether in air 
      or underwater. However, a simple glycerine and water (v/v = 1/1) mixed solution
      could rapidly promote the detachment of the hydrogel from skin automatically,
      without any external force and no residue was left, exhibiting a manmade
      controllable flexible feature. Moreover, the in vitro antibacterial performance
      against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus
      aureus (S. aureus), as well as wound healing investigations conducted in living
      mice confirmed that these hydrogels possessed excellent antibacterial,
      antioxidative, and wound healing abilities. We believe this proof of concept
      could create a novel pathway for the design and construction of highly efficient 
      hydrogel dressings using readily available polymeric materials and that the
      resulting dressing have potential for clinical applications.

TI  - Fabricating Antipathogenic Interfaces via Nanoscale Topographies Inspired from
      Snake Skin.
LID - 10.1021/acsabm.1c01243 [doi]
AB  - Advancements in developing antipathogenic interfaces are critical in mitigating
      the risk of infection spread amid the practical limitations of hygienic control
      in crowded and resource-limited settings. Such requirements are also extremely
      compelling in busy patient care centers including intensive care units where the 
      statutory maintenance of environmental standards often appears to be impractical 
      because of the overflooded patient loads. While advances in surface engineering
      have emerged with great promises to cater these needs, the underlying
      technological complexities appear to be prohibitive against practicable
      applications amid constrained technological resources. Here, we harnessed the
      role of unique topographical features of the skin of Ptyas mucosa (oriental rat
      snake), a commonly found snake species in south and southeast Asia, in terms of
      exhibiting supreme antifouling properties via natural inheritance, leading to
      pathogenic resistance. Our characterization studies unveiled that unlike the
      previously reported vertical pillars, hairs, and needles, arrays of horizontal
      denticulation, offering favorable topographical characteristics of structured
      roughness and hierarchical features, emerged to be responsible for exhibiting the
      desired functionalities. We subsequently adapted these structures with certain
      simplifications by biomimicking artificially engineered topologies on a
      polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface. The resulting surfaces were proven to offer 
      dual antimicrobial mechanisms such as resistances to adhesion or colonization of 
      different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus
      mutans) and facilitation for cell wall deformation and programmed cell death as
      evidenced by an abundance of oxidative stresses. These results opened up
      strategies of producing biomimetic surface textures and their effective
      implementation against pathogenic invasion in a plethora of applications ranging 
      from medical implants to marine propulsion.

TI  - Detailed Characterization of Antipathogenic Properties of Human Milk N-Glycome,
      against Staphylococcus aureus, Indicating Its Targeting on Cell Surface Proteins.
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.1c00652 [doi]
AB  - Human milk N-glycome was previously identified to have strong antipathogenic
      activities. This study is aimed to characterize the detailed antibacterial
      properties and the potential function mechanism of human milk N-glycome against
      Staphylococcus aureus. A serials of traditional antibacterial assays showed that 
      human milk N-glycome possessed both bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities,
      which was further confirmed by the cell structure disruption including the change
      of transmembrane potential and leakage of intracellular contents. The results of 
      the bacterial surface zeta potential and hydrophobicity, bacterial binding assay,
      gel shift assay, and fluorescence spectra and the different synergistic effects
      of human milk N-glycome combined with different antibiotics indicated that the
      bacterial surface proteins could be the targets of human milk N-glycome.
      Moreover, human milk N-glycome also showed antibiofilm activity. In conclusion,
      human milk N-glycome exhibited good potential for acting as an antibacterial
      substance against S. aureus and the antibacterial mechanism was a cell surface
      targeting action.

PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/s13568-022-01345-6 [doi]
AB  - Paper sheets represent one of the infection risk sources inside educational and
      administrative institutions under biological pandemics. So, the present study
      aimed to validate the efficiency of gamma radiation or dry heat techniques to
      sterilize contaminated paper sheets with different indicator pathogens while
      retaining their structure. The results showed that gamma radiation at 6, 12, or
      24 kGy can successfully kill Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus cereus and
      Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and
      Salmonella typhi, and fungi such as Candida albicans. Moreover, dry heating at
      100 degrees C for 60 min, 150 degrees C for 30 min, or 200 degrees C for 15 min
      can be successful in paper decontamination of all tested species. Surprisingly,
      scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs proved that gamma radiation at 6
      kGy, dry heat at 100 degrees C for 60 min or 150 degrees C for 30 min or 200
      degrees C for 15 min, is suitable for paper sheet sterilization while maintaining
      their structure. Ultimately, dry heat is a simple, effective, fast, safe, and
      inexpensive technique for paper sterilization. It may be used as a precautionary 
      step inside educational institutions, especially during written examination
      periods, to ensure a safe life for academic members during biological pandemics
      such as COVID-19.

TI  - Binding of cationic analogues of alpha-MSH to lipopolysaccharide and disruption
      of the cytoplasmic membranes caused bactericidal action against Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1987
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-05684-z [doi]
AB  - In earlier reports, we have shown the antimicrobial activity of a host
      neuropeptide, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and its cationic
      analogues against Staphylococcus aureus. These analogues of alpha-MSH showed
      enhanced staphylocidal activity without any significant mammalian cell toxicity. 
      Therefore, here, we explored the antimicrobial activity of alpha-MSH and its
      cationic analogues against Escherichia coli. Though the presence of
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Gram-negative bacteria enables them to resist most
      conventional antibiotics, encouragingly alpha-MSH and its four analogues showed
      killing of both logarithmic and stationary phase E. coli cells in a time, dose
      and cationicity-dependent manner. In fact, the most cationic analogue, KKK-MSH
      with a + 5 charge, demonstrated successful eradication of 10(5) CFU/mL of E. coli
      cells within 15 min at a concentration as low as 1 microM. BC displacement
      experiment revealed that cationicity of the peptides was directly related to the 
      killing efficacy of these alpha-MSH analogues against E. coli cells via initial
      LPS-binding, leading to rapid disruption of the LPS-outer membrane complex
      followed by inner bacterial membrane damage and eventual cell death. Here, we
      propose alpha-MSH based cationic peptides as promising future agents with
      broad-spectrum antibacterial efficacy against both Gram-negative and
      Gram-positive pathogens.

TI  - Suboccipital extracranial and intracranial abscess of a neonate: an exceedingly
      rare occurrence.
LID - e246929 [pii]

AB  - Intracranial abscess is a life-threatening disease that is uncommon in paediatric
      populations. Although there have been few reports in the literature, some
      aetiologies, such as mastoiditis and sinusitis, have been proposed. The
      pathophysiology is not completely known, and there are no data regarding the
      long-term follow-up of these patients. Herein, we present a case of a newborn
      affected with a mass in the suboccipital region due to an extracranial and
      intracranial abscess that had no clear association with infections except for a
      transient fever episode 1 month earlier. Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus from 
      an open-surgery sample identified the cause of the mass. The patient achieved
      excellent recovery with no recurrence even after 8 years of follow-up. To our
      knowledge, this rare pattern of infection highlights the importance of early
      diagnosis in combination with a surgical approach as an effective diagnosis and
      treatment approach that provided a good outcome.

AB  - A great variety of coumarin-related compounds, both natural and synthetic, being 
      often brightly fluorescent, have shown themselves beneficial in medicine for both
      therapeutic and imaging purposes. Here, in search for effective uncouplers of
      oxidative phosphorylation, we synthesized a series of 7-hydroxycoumarin
      (umbelliferone, UB) derivatives combining rather high membrane affinity with the 
      presence of a hydroxyl group deprotonable at physiological pH - alkyl esters of
      umbelliferone-4-acetic acid (UB-4 esters) differing in alkyl chain length.
      Addition of UB-4 esters to isolated rat liver mitochondria (RLM) resulted in
      their rapid depolarization, unexpectedly followed by membrane potential recovery 
      on a minute time scale. According to TLC and HPLC data, incubation of RLM with
      UB-4 esters caused their hydrolysis, which led to disappearance of the uncoupling
      activity (recoupling). Both mitochondrial recoupling and hydrolysis of UB-4
      esters were suppressed by inhibitors of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase
      (ALDH2), disulfiram and daidzin, thus pointing to the involvement of this enzyme 
      in the recoupling of RLM incubated with UB-4 esters. The protonophoric mechanism 
      of mitochondrial uncoupling by UB-4 esters was proved in experiments with
      artificial bilayer lipid membranes (BLM): these compounds induced
      proton-selective electrical current across planar BLM and caused dissipation of
      pH gradient on liposomes. UB-4 esters showed antibacterial activity against
      Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium smegmatis.

TI  - Targeting the ATP synthase in bacterial and fungal pathogens - beyond
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
LID - S2213-7165(22)00030-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jgar.2022.01.026 [doi]
AB  - The ATP synthase is a multicomponent enzyme that is largely conserved across the 
      kingdoms of life. In many species the ATP synthase is central in the synthesis of
      ATP by using the electrochemical proton gradient generated via the electron
      transport chain. Bacteria inhabit very diverse ecological niches, hence their
      metabolism to extract nutrients and generation of ATP varies from species to
      species. Some species are obligate aerobes (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis),
      relying on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP synthesis, while others are strict
      anaerobes (e.g. Clostridioides difficile) relying primarily on substrate-level
      phosphorylation using various fermentative pathways. Yet other species, such as
      Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli are facultative anaerobes and can
      convert energy via both respiratory and fermentative pathways. The metabolic
      propensity and growth conditions experienced by bacterial species have great
      impact on the necessity of a functional ATP synthase. The ATP synthase has been
      validated as a druggable target with the approval of the ATP synthase inhibitor
      bedaquiline for treatment of M. tuberculosis, an organism in which the ATP
      synthase is essential for growth. Currently no ATP synthase inhibitors are in
      clinical use against non-mycobacterial pathogens. In this review, the
      physiological functions of the ATP synthase in various bacterial pathogens are
      discussed in relation to the metabolic pathways utilized for providing energy.
      The ATP synthase is essential in important pathogenic species that are obligate
      aerobes, obligate anaerobes and aerotolerant anaerobes, whereas it is dispensable
      for growth in most facultative anaerobic pathogens. Interference with the ATP
      synthase in facultative anaerobes has physiological consequences, such as
      membrane hyperpolarization, which can be exploited for combination therapies.
      Collectively, the available data indicate that the ATP synthase is an interesting
      target for development of new antimicrobials beyond M. tuberculosis.

AB  - Ozone treatment is an eco-friendly and cost-effective approach to achieve
      material disinfection, and this disinfection method is of utmost importance in
      the present global pandemic. The efficacy of ozone's oxidative potential on
      common microorganisms has been extensively studied, particularly in the food and 
      water treatment industries. However, little is still understood regarding its
      antimicrobial capabilities for the treatment of textile substrates in air. In
      this study, fabric swatches inoculated with bacterial and fungal suspensions are 
      exposed to ozone for different durations and at different ozone concentrations.
      Pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus), and fungi
      (Aspergillus fumigatus, and Candida albicans), are the microbes utilised in this 
      study. The efficacy of ozone is demonstrated by the complete removal of
      microbiota on the tested swatches when a concentration and exposure duration of
      20 ppm and 4 mins are respectively maintained in a test ozone chamber. We expect 
      the insights from this work to guide the development of new ozonation techniques 
      capable of rapid sterilisation in industrial & public settings.

LID - S0255-0857(22)00005-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmmb.2022.01.005 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Staphylococcus aureus infections are a major cause of concern in
      nosocomial infections and especially so, in the hospitalized immunocompromised
      patients. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a skin commensal that could have a role
      in preventing colonization on human skin by potential pathogen. METHODS: The
      probable protective role of S. epidermidis, its lysate (S.epi lysate) and spent
      culture fluid (SCF) has been explored against S. aureus using human epidermal
      keratinocytes as a model system. The viability of keratinocytes and bacterial
      adhesion was investigated pre- and post-exposure to S. epi lysate and SCF.
      RESULTS: The viability of keratinocytes was significantly reduced when incubated 
      with S. aureus for 24 h while S. epidermidis and its extracts exhibited no
      significant effect. S. aureus infected keratinocytes showed increased viability
      when incubated with viable S. epidermidis which was even greater with its lysate 
      and SCF. The timing of the application of lysate and SCF affected the degree of
      protection conferred to the keratinocytes against S. aureus induced toxicity.
      Co-exposed and post-exposed keratinocytes were afforded equal protection.
      However, a pre-exposure of 2 h was not efficient enough to provide significant
      protection. S. epi lysate and SCF reduced the number of adherent cells
      considerably even after 8 h of pathogen exposure. CONCLUSIONS: S. epidermidis and
      its extracts protect human epidermal keratinocytes from the toxic effects of S.
      aureus by competitive displacement of pathogen and reduction in adhesion. S. epi 
      lysate and SCF are safer options for the treatment of pathogen induced skin
      damage.

      endogenous FOXP3 in human breast cancer cells.
PG  - 38
LID - 10.1186/s12943-021-01472-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unlike autosomal tumor suppressors, X-linked tumor suppressors can be
      inactivated by a single hit due to X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). Here, we
      argue that targeted reactivation of the non-mutated allele from XCI offers a
      potential therapy for female breast cancers. METHODS: Towards this goal, we
      developed a dual CRISPR interference and activation (CRISPRi/a) approach for
      simultaneously silencing and reactivating multiple X-linked genes using two
      orthogonal, nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas9 (dCas9) proteins. RESULTS: Using
      Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9-KRAB for silencing XIST and Staphylococcus aureus
      dCas9-VPR for activating FOXP3, we achieved CRISPR activation of FOXP3 in various
      cell lines of human female breast cancers. In human breast cancer HCC202 cells,
      which express a synonymous heterozygous mutation in the coding region of FOXP3,
      simultaneous silencing of XIST from XCI led to enhanced and prolonged FOXP3
      activation. Also, reactivation of endogenous FOXP3 in breast cancer cells by
      CRISPRi/a inhibited tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. We further optimized
      CRISPRa by fusing dCas9 to the demethylase TET1 and observed enhanced FOXP3
      activation. Analysis of the conserved CpG-rich region of FOXP3 intron 1 confirmed
      that CRISPRi/a-mediated simultaneous FOXP3 activation and XIST silencing were
      accompanied by elevated H4 acetylation, including H4K5ac, H4K8ac, and H4K16ac,
      and H3K4me3 and lower DNA methylation. This indicates that CRISPRi/a targeting to
      XIST and FOXP3 loci alters their transcription and their nearby epigenetic
      modifications. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous activation and repression of the
      X-linked, endogenous FOXP3 and XIST from XCI offers a useful research tool and a 
      potential therapeutic for female breast cancers.

TI  - Pott's puffy tumour of the frontal and Parietal bones with subgaleal abscess as a
      complication of acute sinusitis - a case report.
PG  - S170-S173
AB  - Acute sinusitis is a frequent medical condition that can affect any age group and
      may lead infrequently to very serious life-threatening complications. These
      complications include the spread of infection to frontal and other cranial bones,
      meninges, and other intracranial structures that require urgent medical actions
      to prevent mortality and morbidity. We report the case of acute frontal sinusitis
      in a 14 years old male who presented with fever, severe headache, and fluctuant
      swelling of the nasal root, and right supraorbital and frontoparietal regions.
      Imaging studies demonstrated signs of left-sided sinusitis, osteomyelitis of the 
      frontal bones, and right parietal bone. Urgent surgery was performed with
      drainage of the abscesses and samples were sent for culture and sensitivity.
      Bilateral antral washout and trephination of the left frontal sinus was performed
      and pus was evacuated. Growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Peptostreptococcus
      micros was reported and according to the sensitivity report, the patient was kept
      on intravenous meropenem, 1500 mg per day and vancomycin 1500 mg per day was
      added on the 7th postoperative day. The patient was discharged from the hospital 
      in good health on the 25th postoperative day and kept on oral vancomycin for one 
      month.

TI  - Ellagic acid-rich Pomegranate extracts synergizes moxifloxacin against
      methicillin resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
PG  - S88-S92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the anti- Methicillin resistance Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA) effect of pomegranate alone and in combination with moxifloxacin
      fluoroquinolone. METHODS: A total of five clinical isolates of MRSA (ATCC 43300) 
      were used in the study. Disc diffusion method was used to determine the anti-MRSA
      effect of pomegranate and/or moxifloxacin by using Mueller-Hinton agar. Minimal
      inhibitory concentration (MIC), fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) of
      moxifloxacin and pomegranate were calculated, the dynamic picture of the
      bactericidal effect of pomegranate and/or moxifloxacin was determined. SPSS
      version 20.00 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Zone of inhibition (ZOI) of
      moxifloxacin was 19.67+/-4.84mm which was not significant compared with
      pomegranate ZOI 14.59+/-2.73mm, (P=0.07). The combination of moxifloxacin and
      pomegranate led to more significant ZOI (26.83+/-4.91mm) compared with
      moxifloxacin (P=0.04) and pomegranate alone (P=0.0012). MIC of pomegranate was
      high (31.62+/-6.95mg/mL) compared with low MIC of moxifloxacin (2.70+/-0.63
      mg/mL), (P<0.0001), while MIC of the combination was low (1.22+/-0.85mg/mL)
      compared MIC of moxifloxacin, (P=0.012). FIC of pomegranate was 0.038 and FIC of 
      moxifloxacin was 0.45, therefore sFIC index was 0.488, equal to the synergistic
      effect. The kill rates of combination were higher than those of pomegranate or
      moxifloxacin, against MRSA ATCC 43300. CONCLUSIONS: Ellagic acid-rich pomegranate
      extract alone has significant antibacterial activity and synergizes the
      bactericidal effect of moxifloxacin against MRSA.

TI  - Preoperative Colonization with Staphylococcus Aureus in THA Is Associated with
      Increased Length of Stay.
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000002136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a common organism implicated in prosthetic
      joint infection after THA and TKA, prompting preoperative culturing and
      decolonization to reduce infection rates. It is unknown whether colonization is
      associated with other noninfectious outcomes of THA or TKA. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
      (1) What is the association between preoperative S. aureus colonization
      (methicillin-sensitive S. aureus [MSSA] and methicillin-resistant S. aureus
      [MRSA]) and the noninfectious outcomes (discharge destination, length of stay,
      Hip/Knee Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [HOOS/KOOS] pain score,
      HOOS/KOOS physical function score, 90-day readmission, and 1-year reoperation) of
      THA and TKA? (2) What factors are associated with colonization with S. aureus?
      METHODS: Between July 2015 and March 2019, 8078 patients underwent primary THA in
      a single healthcare system, and 17% (1382) were excluded because they were not
      tested preoperatively for S. aureus nasal colonization, leaving 6696 patients in 
      the THA cohort. Between June 2015 and March 2019, 9434 patients underwent primary
      TKA, and 12% (1123) were excluded because they were not tested for S. aureus
      colonization preoperatively, leaving 8311 patients in the TKA cohort. The goal of
      the institution's standardized care pathways is to test all THA and TKA patients 
      preoperatively for S. aureus nasal colonization; the reason the excluded patients
      were not tested could not be determined. Per institutional protocols, all
      patients were given chlorhexidine gluconate skin wipes to use on the day before
      and the day of surgery, and patients with positive S. aureus cultures were
      instructed to use mupirocin nasal ointment twice daily for 3 to 5 days
      preoperatively. Adherence to these interventions was not tracked, and patients
      were not rescreened to test for S. aureus control. The minimum follow-up time for
      each outcome and the percentage of the cohort lost for each was: for discharge
      destination, until discharge (0 patients lost); for length of stay, until
      discharge (0.06% [4 of 6696] lost in the THA group and 0.01% [1 of 8311] lost in 
      the TKA group); for HOOS/KOOS pain score, 1 year (26% [1734 of 6696] lost in the 
      THA group and 24% [2000 of 8311] lost in the TKA group); for HOOS/KOOS physical
      function, 1 year (33% [2193 of 6696] lost in the THA group and 28% [2334 of 8311]
      lost in the TKA group); for 90-day readmission, 90 days (0.06% [4 of 6696] lost
      in the THA group and 0.01% [1 of 8311] lost in the TKA group); and for 1-year
      reoperation, 1 year (30% [1984 of 6696] lost in the THA group and 30% [2475 of
      8311] lost in the TKA group). Logistic regression models were constructed to test
      for associations between MSSA or MRSA and nonhome discharge, length of stay
      greater than 1 day, improvement in the HOOS/KOOS pain subscale (>/= the minimum
      clinically important difference), HOOS/KOOS physical function short form (>/=
      minimum clinically important difference), 90-day readmission, and 1-year
      reoperation. We adjusted for patient-related and hospital-related factors, such
      as patient age and hospital site. Variable significance was assessed using the
      likelihood ratio test with a significance level of p < 0.05. To assess factors
      associated with S. aureus colonization, we constructed a logistic regression
      model with the same risk factors. RESULTS: Among the THA cohort, after
      controlling for potentially confounding variables such as patient age, smoking
      status, and BMI, S. aureus colonization was associated with length of stay
      greater than 1 day (MSSA: odds ratio 1.32 [95% CI 1.08 to 1.60]; MRSA: OR 1.88
      [95% CI 1.24 to 2.85]; variable p < 0.001 by likelihood ratio test) but not the
      other outcomes of THA. Male sex (OR 1.26 [95% CI 1.09 to 1.45]; p = 0.001) and
      BMI (OR 1.02 for a one-unit increase over median BMI [95% CI 1.01 to 1.03]; p =
      0.003) were patient-related factors associated with S. aureus colonization,
      whereas factors associated with a lower odds were older age (OR 0.99 [95% CI 0.98
      to 0.99]; p < 0.001) and Black race compared with White race (OR 0.64 [95% CI
      0.50 to 0.82]; p < 0.001). Among the TKA cohort, S. aureus colonization was
      associated with 90-day readmission (MSSA: OR 1.00 [95% CI 0.99 to 1.01]; MRSA: OR
      1.01 [95% CI 1.00 to 1.01]; variable p = 0.007 by likelihood ratio test). Male
      sex (OR 1.19 [95% CI 1.05 to 1.34]; p = 0.006) was associated with S. aureus
      colonization, whereas factors associated with a lower odds of colonization were
      older age (OR 0.99 [95% CI 0.98 to 0.99]; p < 0.001), Veterans RAND-12 mental
      component score (OR 0.99 [95% CI 0.99 to 1.00]; p = 0.027), Black race compared
      with White race (OR 0.70 [95% CI 0.57 to 0.85]; p < 0.001), and being a former
      smoker (OR 0.86 [95% CI 0.75 to 0.97]; p = 0.016) or current smoker (OR 0.70 [95%
      CI 0.55 to 0.90]; p = 0.005) compared with those who never smoked. CONCLUSION:
      After controlling for the variables we explored, S. aureus colonization was
      associated with increased length of stay after THA and 90-day readmission after
      TKA, despite preoperative decolonization. Given that there is little causal
      biological link between colonization and these outcomes, the association is
      likely confounded but may be a proxy for undetermined social or biological
      factors, which may alert the surgeon to pay increased attention to outcomes in
      patients who test positive. Further study of the association of S. aureus
      colonization and increased length of stay after THA and readmission after TKA may
      be warranted to determine what the confounding variables are, which may be best
      accomplished using large cohorts or registry data. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, 
      therapeutic study.

TI  - In vitro characterization of hydroxyapatite and cobalt ferrite nanoparticles
      compounds and their biocompatibility in vivo.
PG  - 21
LID - 10.1007/s10856-022-06640-z [doi]
AB  - Bioactive materials in combination with antibiotics have been widely developed
      for the treatment of bone infection. Thus, this work aims to characterize six
      biomaterials formulated with different concentrations of hydroxyapatite and
      cobalt ferrite nanoparticles, in addition to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, using 
      X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the antibiotic
      diffusion test on agar. Furthermore, in vivo biocompatibility and the
      reabsorption process of these materials were analyzed. XRD showed that both
      hydroxyapatite and cobalt ferrite present high crystallinity. The
      photomicrographs obtained by SEM revealed that composites have a complex surface,
      evidenced by the irregular arrangement of the hydroxyapatite and cobalt ferrite
      granules, besides demonstrating the interaction between their components. The
      antibiotic-diffusion test showed that all biomaterials produced an inhibition
      halo in Staphylococcus aureus cultures. For the biocompatibility study,
      composites were surgically implanted in the dorsal region of rabbits. At 15, 30, 
      70, and 100 days, biopsies of the implanted regions were performed. The
      biomaterials were easily identified during histological analysis and no
      significant inflammatory process, nor histological signs of toxicity or rejection
      by the adjacent tissue were observed. We can conclude that the biomaterials
      analyzed are biocompatible, degradable, and effective in inhibiting the in vitro 
      growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Graphical abstract.

TI  - Preparation of chitosan-tannic acid coating and its anti-osteoclast and
      antibacterial activities in titanium implants.
LID - 10.1007/s00774-022-01309-7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial infection and aseptic loosening caused by bone resorption
      at the implant interface are major clinical complications during bone defect
      implantation surgery, and surface modification of the implant to address the
      aforementioned problems has long been a research focus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In
      this paper, a chitosan (CTS)-tannic acid (TA) colloid coating with a negative
      charge and excellent hydrophilicity was prepared on a Ti6Al4V (TC4) surface using
      a layer-by-layer assembly method. The physical properties, anti-osteoclast
      activity, and antimicrobial activity of the coatings were investigated. RESULTS: 
      The findings showed that when the pH value was 5 and the ratio of CTS:TA was 0.8,
      the carrying rate of TA was the best. Furthermore, the CTS-TA coating had no
      cytotoxicity on the morphology and proliferation of BMSCs cells and effectively
      inhibited the differentiation of RAW264.7 cells into osteoclasts and the
      proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. With the increase in
      the immersion time of TC4 in CTS-TA colloid solution, the inhibitory effects will
      also enhance. CONCLUSION: Therefore, the preparation of the CTS-TA coating
      provides a revolutionary technique for implant surface modification to avoid
      postoperative bacterial infection and aseptic loosening.

TI  - Investigational agents for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
      aureus (MRSA) bacteremia: Progress in clinical trials.
LID - 10.1080/13543784.2022.2040015 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus is common. Cases caused 
      by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are particularly formidable and often
      lethal. The mortality associated with MRSA bacteremia has not significantly
      decreased over the past couple of decades and concerns regarding efficacy and
      toxicity of standard therapy highlight the need for novel agents and new
      therapeutic approaches. AREAS COVERED: This paper explores clinical trials
      investigating novel therapeutic approaches to S. aureus bacteremia. There is a
      special focus on MRSA bacteremia. Monotherapy and combination therapies and novel
      antimicrobials and adjunctive therapies that are only recently being established 
      for therapeutic use are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: The unfavorable safety profile
      of combination antimicrobial therapy in clinical trials has outweighed its
      benefits. Therefore, future investigation should focus on optimizing duration and
      de-escalation protocols. Antibody and bacteriophage lysin-based candidates have
      mostly been limited to safety trials, but progress with these agents is
      demonstrated through a lysin-based agent receiving a phase III trial. Antibiotics
      indicated for use in treating MRSA skin infections see continued investigation as
      treatments for MRSA bacteremia despite the difficulty of completing trials in
      this patient population. Promising agents include dalbavancin, ceftobiprole,
      ceftaroline, and exebacase.

TI  - Submicron topography design for controlling staphylococcal bacterial adhesion and
      biofilm formation.
LID - 10.1002/jbm.a.37369 [doi]
AB  - Surface topography modification with nano- or micro-textured structures has been 
      an efficient approach to inhibit microbial adhesion and biofilm formation and
      thereby to prevent biomaterial-associated infection without modification of
      surface chemistry/bulk properties of materials and without causing antibiotic
      resistance. This manuscript focuses on submicron-textured patterns with ordered
      arrays of pillars on polyurethane (PU) biomaterial surfaces in an effort to
      understand the effects of surface pillar features and surface properties on
      adhesion and colonization responses of two staphylococcal strains. Five submicron
      patterns with a variety of pillar dimensions were designed and fabricated on PU
      film surfaces and bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation of Staphylococcal
      strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A and Staphylococcus aureus Newman D2C)
      were characterized. Results show that all submicron textured surface
      significantly reduced bacterial adhesion and inhibited biofilm formation, and
      bacterial adhesion linearly decreased with the reduction in top surface area
      fraction. Surface wettability did not show a linear correlation with bacterial
      adhesion, suggesting that surface contact area dominates bacterial adhesion. From
      this, it appears that the design of textured patterns should minimize surface
      area fraction to reduce the bacterial interaction with surfaces but in a way that
      ensures the mechanical strength of pillars in order to avoid collapse. These
      findings may provide a rationale for design of polymer surfaces for antifouling
      medical devices.

TI  - Orange-red to NIR emissive carbon dots for antimicrobial, bioimaging and bacteria
      diagnosis.
LID - 10.1039/d1tb02457d [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has become a popular technology for the
      treatment of bacterial infections. The development of antimicrobial agents
      combining diagnosis and treatment remains a major challenge. Herein, curcumin
      carbon quantum dots (Cur-NRCQDs) with antibacterial and imaging effects were
      synthesized using a hydrothermal method. The fluorescence absorption range of the
      Cur-NRCQDs in aqueous solution was 555 to 850 nm, showing orange-red to near
      infrared (NIR) fluorescence, and its maximum emission wavelength was 635 nm. At
      the same time, Cur-NRCQDs improved the efficiency of Cur as the photosensitizer
      (PS), showed good storage and light stability, and enhanced the efficiency of
      reactive oxygen (ROS) generation and antibacterial activity. Under the
      irradiation of a xenon lamp, Cur-NRCQDs inactivated 100% Staphylococcus aureus
      (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) at concentrations of 10 and 15 muM,
      respectively. The possible reason for this was that under PDT, the ROS produced
      by the Cur-NRCQDs destroyed the integrity of the cell membrane, resulting in
      leakage of the contents. In addition, the Cur-NRCQDs showed good cell
      compatibility, as they can also enter bacteria and cells for imaging, so they can
      be employed for the detection of bacteria and cell tissues. Therefore, Cur-NRCQDs
      are an ideal candidate material for aPDT treatment and fluorescent bioimaging.

AB  - Antidesma thwaitesianum Mull. Arg. or Mao is well-known in Thailand for its use
      in soft drinks and wine. This study investigated the potential of its fruit juice
      as a food preservative based on its antimicrobial activity against food-borne
      pathogens and spoilage. The fruit juice had antibacterial activity against
      Bacillus cereus TISTR1527, Staphylococcus aureus TISTR2329, Listeria
      monocytogenes DMST17303, Pseudomonas aeruginosa TISTR357, Salmonella Typhimurium 
      DMST562, and Escherichia coli TISTR074. The minimum inhibitory concentration
      ranged from 25 to 100 mg/ml. Of significance was that the juice had excellent
      antifungal activities against Aspergillus flavus TISTR3135 and Penicillium
      digitatum ATCC10030. Furthermore, the fruit juice increased the lag time of spore
      germination of P. digitatum. Analysis of the phytochemical contents of the juice 
      showed that the total phenolic and flavonoid contents were 20.07 mg GAE/g and
      3.57 mg QE/g, respectively. In antioxidant activity assay, the juice exhibited
      moderate DPPH and ABTS(+) radical scavenging and ferric-reducing activities. The 
      addition of 5% fruit juice extended the microbial shelf life of chiffon cake. The
      treated chiffon cake had a shelf-life of 7 days, compared to 3 days for the
      untreated control. These results support the possible use of Mao fruit juice as
      an antimicrobial agent and a natural food preservative.

AB  - This study aimed to estimate the effect of cobalt nanoparticles (Co NPs) with
      different concentrations against multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacteria.
      Three isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive), Proteus spp.
      (gram-negative), and Escherichia coli (gram-negative) bacteria were extracted
      from various clinical examples utilizing routine methods on bacteriological
      culture media. The antibacterial sensitivity of commercial antibiotics such as
      Ciprofloxacin, Cefotaxime, Gentamycin, and Amoxicillin was broken down on a
      Muller Hinton agar plate and evaluated using the disk diffusion method. The study
      results demonstrated the antibacterial effect of the Co NPs against the bacterial
      isolates with three different concentrations utilized in the study. The results
      indicated that the Co NPs showed the highest antibacterial activity when
      utilizing 100 mug/ml against Escherichia coli followed by Proteus spp and
      Staphylococcus aureus with zones of inhibition measured as 22.2+/-0.1 mm,
      20.3+/-0.15 mm, and 15.8+/-0.1 mm; respectively. Co NPs at a 100 mug/mL
      concentration showed higher inhibition zones than several common antibiotics
      except for Ciprofloxacin, which demonstrated better antibacterial activity
      against the bacterial isolates employed in this study. Scanning Electron
      Microscope (SEM)and X-Ray diffraction (XRD)studies confirmed that Cobalt
      nanoparticles (Co NPs) were synthesized from cobalt sulphate solution with a size
      ranging from 40 nm to 60 nm. The nanoparticles showed a crystalline structure
      with a round shape and smooth surface. The antibacterial resistance of Co NPs
      against three common bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus spp, and
      Escherichia coli was assessed in this study. The optimum concentration of the Co 
      NPs was identified as 100 mug/ml, which could provide a similar or higher
      antibacterial effect.

TI  - Ophthalmic herpes zoster with severe complications in an immunocompromised
      patient: A case report and review of the literature.
PG  - 214
LID - 10.3892/etm.2022.11138 [doi]
AB  - The increasing incidence for herpes zoster, including its ophthalmic form, is
      based on physiological (senescence) and acquired immunosuppression, particularly 
      under oncologic treatment. The immunocompromised status of the patient favors the
      appearance of severe complications. The patient, aged 54, with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia, presented 1 week from the onset with an erythematous,
      vesicular-bullous rash on the right trigeminal nerve's ophthalmic dermatome,
      marked edema, intense pain and large submandibular ganglion masses. There were
      cutaneous (necrotic ulcerations superinfected with methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus), ocular (keratoconjunctivitis, total ophthalmoplegia,
      lagophthalmia, anterior hemorrhagic uveitis with hyphema and right eye blindness)
      and neurological (postherpetic neuralgia) complications. Systemic therapy was
      performed with acyclovir, antibiotics, supportive, rebalancing and symptomatics. 
      With regards to treatment for skin ulcers, disinfection and necrectomy were
      performed, and epithelialization agents were subsequently administrated. At the
      ocular level, the ophthalmologist carefully monitored the patient and
      administered antivirals, antibiotics, epithelialization agents and autologous
      serum. The evolution of the case recorded severe, disabling complications, with
      extensive eyelid necrosis and definitive blindness. In this case, the severity of
      the ophthalmic herpes zoster (OHZ) was favored by the synergistic action of four 
      factors: Acquired immunosuppression (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), delayed
      consultation, superinfectious lesions and patient non-compliance regarding the
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment.

AB  - Nosocomial surfaces are potential pathogen reservoirs. Our aim was to describe
      the microbial diversity and analyze microbial patterns of healthcare-associated
      pathogens in two step-down-care-units at a tertiary care hospital. We monitored
      infected patients over 45 days to describe microbial diversity and colonization
      patterns. A total of 2762 isolates were recovered from the sampled sites,
      coagulase-negative staphylococci represented 44.64% (1233/2762) of the isolates. 
      The most frequently recovered ESKAPE species (Enterococcus faecium,
      Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae) were A. baumannii (7.53%;
      208/2762 isolates) and E. faecium/Enterococcus faecalis (5.18%; 143/2762). We
      recovered a high diversity of species, including potential pathogens. A.
      baumannii was detected more frequently on diverse surfaces and persisted in
      patients' nostrils during the hospital stay.

TI  - Detection, molecular characterization, and antibiogram of multi-drug resistant
      and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from pets and pet
      owners in Malaysia.
PG  - 277-287
LID - 10.22099/ijvr.2021.39586.5752 [doi]
AB  - Background: The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains such as
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MDRSA) in animals and humans with continuous contact are a
      great zoonotic concern. Aims: This cross-sectional study was performed to
      investigate the carriage rate, genotypic characteristics, and to determine the
      antibiogram of S. aureus isolated from pets and pet owners in Malaysia. Methods: 
      Nasal and oral swab samples from 40 cats, 30 dogs, and 70 pet owners were
      collected through convenient sampling. Presumptive colonies on mannitol salt agar
      were subjected to biochemical identification. S. aureus and MRSA were confirmed
      by PCR detection of nuc and mecA genes, respectively. Molecular profiles for
      antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes in S. aureus were also determined.
      The antibiogram was carried out via Kirby-Bauer test using 18 antibiotics.
      Results: 17.5% of cats, 20% of dogs, and 27% of pet owners were S. aureus
      positive. MRSA was also detected in dogs, and pet owners. S. aureus isolates
      displayed high resistance against penicillin (72.7%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate
      (66.7%). 39.4% of S. aureus isolates showed multidrug-resistance traits,
      phenotypically. Molecular characterization of S. aureus revealed the presence of 
      mecA, tetk, tetL, ermA, ermB, ermC, msrA, scn, chp, sak, sep, and sea genes.
      Conclusion: This study showed the emergence of MRSA and MDRSA in pets and pet
      owners in Malaysia. The antibiogram findings showed resistance of S. aureus to
      multiple antibiotics. Furthermore, molecular analysis of immune evasion cluster
      (IEC) strongly suggests the spread of animal-adapted S. aureus lineages among
      pets and pet owners.

      Cactus Transcription in Prawns Macrobrachium nipponense.
PG  - 828271
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.828271 [doi]
AB  - The Hippo signaling pathway controls organ size and immune system in Drosophila
      and mammals. Yorkie acts as a transcriptional co-activator in the Hippo pathway
      and cross-talks with other essential pathways. In this study, a Yorkie gene and
      two Cactus isoforms (designated as MnYorkie, MnCactus-a, and MnCactus-b,
      respectively) were isolated and characterized from oriental river prawns
      (Macrobrachium nipponense). Results showed that MnYorkie includes 1620 bp open
      reading frame and encodes a protein of 539 amino acids (aa). MnCactus-a (377 aa) 
      and MnCactus-b (471 aa) were produced by alternative splicing. MnYorkie and
      MnCactus were continuously expressed in all selected tissues. Upon Gram-positive 
      bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio
      parahaemolyticus stimulation, the mRNA levels of MnYorkie and MnCactus in
      hemocytes and intestines underwent time-dependent enhancement. RNA interference
      studies showed that MnYorkie silencing remarkably downregulated the transcription
      of MnCactus but upregulated the expression of seven immune-related genes. In
      addition, MnYorkie silencing in vivo decreased the susceptibility of prawns to
      bacterial challenge. After S. aureus and V. parahaemolyticus infection, the
      survival rate of prawns increased significantly from 2 to 6 days, which
      corresponded to the period of MnYorkie knockdown. All these findings suggested
      that MnYorkie in the Hippo pathway might exhibit remarkable biological roles in
      the immune defense of M. nipponense by negatively regulating the expression of
      immune-related genes and promoting the transcription of MnCactus.

TI  - Plasma SiOx:H Nanocoatings to Enhance the Antibacterial and Anti-Inflammatory
      Properties of Biomaterials.
PG  - 381-394
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S339000 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of SiOx:H
      nanocoatings using a plasma-deposition technique. Materials and Methods: Four
      groups of SiOx:H nanocoatings were prepared by plasma nanocoating technique using
      different deposition gases and durations, specifically trimethylsilane (TMS) for 
      groups A1 and A2 and a mixture of TMS and oxygen for groups B1 and B2. Changes in
      surface chemistry and physical properties were measured. Staphylococcus aureus
      and Streptococcus mutans were cultured on plasma SiOx:H nanocoatings to evaluate 
      antibacterial and antibiofilm formation activities. Human gingival fibroblasts
      (HGFs) and HaCaT human keratinocytes were cultured and stimulated with tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Cell viability was measured using a Cell
      Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
      (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to evaluate
      anti-inflammatory properties, including the mRNA and protein levels of
      inflammatory mediators and proinflammatory cytokines. Results: The carbon content
      was dominant in group A nanocoatings and the oxygen and silicon elements were
      dominant in group B nanocoatings. Groups A2 and B2 were approximately threefold
      thicker than groups A1 and B1. The plasma SiOx:H nanocoatings decreased bacterial
      growth and biofilm formation by 30-70% (p < 0.05). Scanning electron microscopy
      (SEM) revealed damaged biofilm structures. Moreover, the antibacterial properties
      of group B were greater than group A, and the antibacterial properties of groups 
      A2 and B2 were more effective than A1 and B1, respectively. CCK-8 assays revealed
      the plasma SiOx:H nanocoatings had good biocompatibility. Furthermore, under
      TNF-alpha-induced inflammation, the mRNA and protein levels of interleukin-6,
      interleukin-8, cyclooxygenase-2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were
      downregulated in the plasma SiOx:H nanocoating groups (p < 0.05). Conclusion:
      Plasma SiOx:H nanocoatings exerted antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects
      with excellent biocompatibility. Therefore, the plasma SiOx:H nanocoating
      technique has potential for implant materials and other medical devices.

TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus lung infection in coronavirus disease
      2019: how common?
LID - 10.1097/QCO.0000000000000813 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may
      develop pulmonary bacterial coinfection or superinfection, that could unfavorably
      impact their prognosis. RECENT FINDINGS: The exact burden of
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) lung infection in peculiar
      populations such as patients with COVID-19 remains somewhat elusive, possibly
      because of wide heterogeneity in methods and endpoints across studies. SUMMARY:
      There was important heterogeneity in the retrieved literature on the epidemiology
      of MRSA lung infection in patients with COVID-19, both when considering all other
      bacteria as the denominator (relative prevalence ranging from 2% to 29%) and when
      considering only S. aureus as the denominator (relative prevalence ranging from
      11% to 65%). Overall, MRSA is among the most frequent causative agents of
      pulmonary infection in patients with COVID-19. Improving our ability to rapidly
      reach etiological diagnosis of bacterial lung infection in COVID-19 patients
      remains fundamental if we are to improve the rates of appropriate antibiotic
      therapy in patients with COVID-19 and concomitant/superimposed MRSA infection, at
      the same time avoiding antibiotic overuse in line with antimicrobial stewardship 
      principles.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective for treating a
      number of neurological and psychiatric indications, surgical and hardware-related
      adverse events (AEs) can occur that affect quality of life. This study aimed to
      give an overview of the nature and frequency of those AEs in our center and to
      describe the way they were managed. Furthermore, an attempt was made at
      identifying possible risk factors for AEs to inform possible future preventive
      measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing DBS-related procedures
      between January 2011 and July 2020 were retrospectively analyzed to inventory
      AEs. The mean follow-up time was 43 +/- 31 months. Univariate logistic regression
      analysis was used to assess the predictive value of selected demographic and
      clinical variables. RESULTS: From January 2011 to July 2020, 508 DBS-related
      procedures were performed including 201 implantations of brain electrodes in 200 
      patients and 307 implantable pulse generator (IPG) replacements in 142 patients. 
      Surgical or hardware-related AEs following initial implantation affected 40 of
      200 patients (20%) and resolved without permanent sequelae in all instances. The 
      most frequent AEs were surgical site infections (SSIs) (9.95%, 20/201) and wire
      tethering (2.49%, 5/201), followed by hardware failure (1.99%, 4/201), skin
      erosion (1.0%, 2/201), pain (0.5%, 1/201), lead migration (0.52%, 2/386 electrode
      sites), and hematoma (0.52%, 2/386 electrode sites). The overall rate of AEs for 
      IPG replacement was 5.6% (17/305). No surgical, ie, staged or nonstaged,
      electrode fixation, or patient-related risk factors were identified for SSI or
      wire tethering. CONCLUSIONS: Major AEs including intracranial surgery-related AEs
      or AEs requiring surgical removal or revision of hardware are rare. In
      particular, aggressive treatment is required in SSIs involving multiple sites or 
      when Staphylococcus aureus is identified. For future benchmarking, the
      development of a uniform reporting system for surgical and hardware-related AEs
      in DBS surgery would be useful.

TI  - Thymbra capitata essential oil has a significant antimicrobial activity against
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pre-formed biofilms.
LID - 10.1111/lam.13665 [doi]
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant
      opportunistic pathogen with a great ability to form biofilms. Herein, the
      antimicrobial potential of Thymbra capitata essential oil (EO) against MRSA
      biofilms was investigated. The determination of the minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) and the minimum lethal concentration (MLC) of the T. capitata
      EO was first investigated on a group of clinical isolates from septicemias,
      diabetic foot ulcers and osteomyelitis. Biofilms were incubated with the EO at
      the MLC and its anti-biofilm potential was investigated. A strong antimicrobial
      activity was observed, with MIC and MLC values between 0.32 and 0.64 mg L(-1) .
      However, the concentration of EO necessary for the eradication of planktonic
      cells was insufficient to significantly reduce the biofilm biomass of some
      isolates. Nevertheless, cell culturability and overall cellular metabolism was
      strongly reduced in all biofilms tested, only when the EO was tested. Contrary to
      the tested antibiotics, T. capitata EO showed a significant antimicrobial
      activity against MRSA biofilms, by reducing cellular metabolism and cellular
      culturability.

AB  - A visual Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) fibrous film incorporated with Roselle
      anthocyanin (RS) and Cinnamon essential oil (CEO) (PRC film) was designed via
      electrospinning technology for pork preservation and freshness monitoring. The
      PRC film presented well structural integrity and stability in buffer solutions
      without leaking out RS. And PCR film had well hydrophobic and high permeability
      with water contact angle (WCA) of 109.52 degrees and water vapor permeability
      (WVP) of 2.63 x 10(-7) g m(-1)h(-1)Pa(-1). Importantly, PRC film exhibited good
      antibacterial activity with the inhibition diameter at 29.0 mm and 27.1 mm which 
      against Escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Finally, the
      PRC film was employed as a colorimetric sensor for monitoring pork freshness. It 
      presented visible color changes from pink to blue and effectively prolonged the
      pork shelf-life by 2 days at 4 degrees C. These results indicate a great
      potential in intelligent and active packaging.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Difficult-to-treat infections caused by antibiotic susceptible
      strains have been linked with the occurrence of persisters, a subpopulation of
      dormant bacteria that tolerate antibiotic exposure despite lacking genetic
      resistance. They can be identified phenotypically upon plating on nutrient agar
      because of their altered growth dynamics, resulting in colony size heterogeneity.
      The occurrence of within-patient bacterial phenotypic heterogeneity in various
      infections and clinical determinants of persister formation remains unknown.
      METHODS: We plated bacteria derived from 132 patient-samples of
      difficult-to-treat infections directly on nutrient-rich agar and monitored colony
      growth by time-lapse imaging. We retained 36 Staphylococcus aureus mono-cultures 
      for further analysis. We investigated clinical factors associated with increased 
      colony growth-delay with regression analyses. We corroborated the clinical
      findings using in vitro grown static biofilms, exposed to distinct antibiotics.
      RESULTS: The extent of phenotypic heterogeneity of patient-derived S. aureus
      varied substantially between patients (from no delay to maximally 57.6 h).
      Increased heterogeneity coincided with increased median colony growth-delay.
      Multivariable regression showed that rifampicin treatment was significantly
      associated with increased median growth-delay (13.3 h, [7.13, 19.6], p < 0.001). 
      S. aureus grown in biofilms and exposed to high concentrations of rifampicin or a
      combination of rifampicin with clindamycin or levofloxacin exhibited prolonged
      growth-delay (p < 0.05 for 11/12 comparisons), correlating with a
      strain-dependent increase in antibiotic tolerance. CONCLUSION: Colony size
      heterogeneity upon direct sampling of difficult-to-treat S. aureus infections was
      frequently observed. Hence, future studies are needed to assess the potential
      benefit of phenotypic heterogeneity quantification for staphylococcal infection
      prognosis and treatment guidelines.

AB  - Chitosan (CHI) based hydrogels promote wound healing and relieve inflammations
      and chronic infections. However, in hardly healable ulcers with excessively
      painful inflammations, anti-inflammatory activity of hydrogels can be enhanced by
      the sustained release of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or combining them 
      with antibiotics. Thus, CHI was crosslinked with genipin (GP) to obtain
      biocompatible hydrogels. Moreover, their antibacterial activity was confirmed
      against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with an almost 100% bacteria
      reduction and a potential antibacterial efficacy (R > 2). Furthermore, hydrogels 
      effective healing of ulcerated wounds was corroborated by a significant
      improvement in metabolic activity (95.58 +/- 4.40%), collagen and elastin
      quantities (1.48 +/- 0.07 mug collagen and 5.82 +/- 0.73 mug elastin per mg
      dermal tissue) and histological analysis. Finally, the sustained release of
      acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), cefuroxime (CFX), tetracycline (TCN) and amoxicillin 
      (AMX) were studied, as well as their anti-inflammatory activity. Results confirm 
      the synergistic anti-inflammatory activity by the significant reduction in the
      amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines when ASA was combined with CFX (5.39 +/-
      0.81 ng.mL(-1) TNF-alpha), TCN (4.70 +/- 0.21 ng.mL(-1) TNF-alpha and 49.06 +/-
      9.64 ng.mL(-1) IL-8), and AMX (2.28 +/- 0.36 ng.mL(-1) TNF-alpha, 14.84 +/- 5.57 
      ng.mL(-1) IL-8, and total IL-6 removal).

AB  - Protein-polysaccharide-polyphenol noncovalent ternary complexes possess unique
      physicochemical, structural, and functional properties. In the present study,
      ternary complexes based on whey protein concentrate (WPC; 2%, wt/vol) and high
      methoxyl pectin (HMP; 0.5%, wt/vol) complexes and 0.2 to 0.6% (wt/vol)
      chlorogenic acid (CA) or rosmarinic acid (RA) were formed and characterized at 3 
      pH values (4, 4.5, and 5). The pH conditions were decided according to phase
      diagram of WPC and HMP during acidification. Fluorescence quenching experiments
      indicated that WPC-HMP complexes bound RA stronger than CA and the binding
      constant increased with increasing pH for both phenolic acids. Particle size of
      ternary complexes decreased and absolute zeta-potential increased with pH values 
      changing from 4 to 5, and RA influenced the particle size of WPC-HMP complexes
      greater than CA. The CA and RA in ternary complexes showed good stability against
      UV light with pH order of pH 5 > pH 4.5 > pH 4. Fourier-transform infrared
      spectroscopy spectra indicated the involvement of hydrogen bonding between
      WPC-HMP and CA or RA. Antibacterial tests showed that ternary complexes had good 
      antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli at
      concentrations of 6.2 mg/mL and the ability increased with decreasing pH values. 
      All ternary complexes possessed strong scavenging radical capacities with median 
      inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 2.71 +/- 0.05 to 6.20 +/-
      0.41 mug/mL. Antioxidative ability of ternary complexes increased as pH went up
      and WPC-HMP-RA showed significantly higher antioxidative property compared with
      WPC-HMP-CA. Data may provide useful information for rational design of ternary
      complexes and applications of the formed complexes in food matrices such as
      beverages and emulsions.

AB  - In this study, a biodegradable photodynamic antibacterial film (Car-Cur) was
      prepared using casting method with kappa-Carrageenan (kappa-Car) as film-forming 
      substrate and curcumin-beta-cyclodextrin (Cur-beta-CD) complex as
      photosensitizer. The comprehensive performance of this Car-Cur film was
      investigated. The obtained results showed that the concentration of Cur-beta-CD
      was an important factor determining the properties of film including tensile
      strength (TS) elongation at break (EB), water vapor permeability (WVP), water
      content (WC) and thermal stability. When the concentration of Cur-beta-CD is 1%, 
      the film demonstrated the maximum TS and EB, increased thermal stability, with
      desirable WVP and WC. Furthermore, this film also showed good photodynamic
      antibacterial potential against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli upon
      irradiation of blue LED light. Moreover, the film can be degraded in the soil in 
      one week. In conclusion, our results suggested Car-Cur photodynamic film could be
      developed as biodegradable antimicrobial packaging material for food
      preservation.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus mediates pyroptosis in bovine mammary epithelial cell via
      activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/s13567-022-01027-y [doi]
AB  - Cell death and inflammation are intimately linked during mastitis due to
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Pyroptosis, a programmed necrosis triggered by
      gasdermin protein family, often occurs after inflammatory caspase activation.
      Many pathogens invade host cells and activate cell-intrinsic death mechanisms,
      including pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. We reported that bovine mammary
      epithelial cells (MAC-T) respond to S. aureus by NOD-like receptor protein 3
      (NLRP3) inflammasome activation through K(+) efflux, leading to the recruitment
      of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) and the activation of caspase-1.
      The activated caspase-1 cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD) and forms a N-terminal pore
      forming domain that drives swelling and membrane rupture. Membrane rupture
      results in the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-1beta,
      which are activated by caspase-1. Can modulate GSDMD activation by
      NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation and then cause pyroptosis of bovine mammary 
      epithelial cells.

AB  - Bacterial infections on implantable materials can cause severe complications for 
      affected patients, posing a serious threat to human health. Therefore, the
      development of appropriate surface modification strategies to construct the
      antibacterial platforms on medical implants are urgently needed. In this work,
      the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-stabilized polypyrrole nanoparticles (PVA-PPy NPs) 
      were prepared by oxidative polymerization using FeCl3 as the oxidant. Subsequent 
      mixing of the PVA-PPy NPs solution mixture with tannic acid (TA) was facilitated 
      by hydrogen bonding. The as-formed TA/PVA-PPy NPs can be deposited with good
      adhesion onto solid materials in a substrate-independent manner. The hydrophilic 
      TA/PVA-PPy NPs-deposited titanium (Ti-TPP) surface can reduce the adhesion of
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). In addition,
      the Ti-TPP surface had photothermal property under 808 nm near-infrared (NIR)
      irradiation, which can kill the adhered bacteria via the hyperthermal effect.
      Upon exposure to NIR, the respective survival rates of S. aureus and E. coli on
      the Ti-TPP surfaces were only 1.66% and 2.78%, in comparison to those on the
      pristine Ti surfaces. Furthermore, the Ti-TPP surface could prevent the formation
      of early-stage biofilm under NIR irradiation. The TA/PVA-PPy NPs composites can
      be utilized as a contact-photoactive antibacterial coating for biomedical
      applications.

AB  - Although the coronavirus pandemic has been the defining global health crisis of
      our time, public health officials have been sounding the alarm of another ominous
      threat for years: an impending antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis. Antibiotics
      in dermatology are often used for prolonged courses in the treatment of skin and 
      soft tissue infections and common inflammatory skin conditions, increasing the
      risk of microbiome alteration and antibiotic-related adverse effects, all while
      exerting consequential selective pressures on both pathogenic and bystander
      bacteria. In this review, we hope to raise awareness of the crisis of AMR and
      review the resistance concerns related to dermatology-relevant bacterial
      pathogens.

AB  - Fatty acid (FA) transfer proteins extract FA from membranes and sequester them to
      facilitate their movement through the cytosol. Detailed structural information is
      available for these soluble protein-FA complexes, but the structure of the
      protein conformation responsible for FA exchange at the membrane is unknown.
      Staphylococcus aureus FakB1 is a prototypical bacterial FA transfer protein that 
      binds palmitate within a narrow, buried tunnel. Here, we define the
      conformational change from a 'closed' FakB1 state to an 'open' state that
      associates with the membrane and provides a path for entry and egress of the FA. 
      Using NMR spectroscopy, we identified a conformationally flexible dynamic region 
      in FakB1, and X-ray crystallography of FakB1 mutants captured the conformation of
      the open state. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations show that the new
      amphipathic alpha-helix formed in the open state inserts below the phosphate
      plane of the bilayer to create a diffusion channel for the hydrophobic FA tail to
      access the hydrocarbon core and place the carboxyl group at the phosphate layer. 
      The membrane binding and catalytic properties of site-directed mutants were
      consistent with the proposed membrane docked structure predicted by our molecular
      dynamics simulations. Finally, the structure of the bilayer-associated
      conformation of FakB1 has local similarities with mammalian FA binding proteins
      and provides a conceptual framework for how these proteins interact with the
      membrane to create a diffusion channel from the FA location in the bilayer to the
      protein interior.

TI  - Bactericidal and antioxidant effects of essential oils from Satureja montana L., 
      Myristica fragrans H. AND Cymbopogon flexuosus.

AB  - The extraction and characterization of the essential oils (EO) from Satureja
      montana L., Myristica fragrans H. and Cymbopogon flexuosus and the determination 
      of their antibacterial and antioxidante activities were achieved. The EO were
      identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and quantified by gas
      chromatography using a flame ionization detector. The antibacterial potential
      against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated by cell
      susceptibility assays and by scanning electron microscopy. The antioxidant
      activity was evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl assay, by
      beta-carotene bleaching and by determining the reducing power. Borneol (36.18%), 
      gamma-terpineol (12.66%), and carvacrol (11.07%) were the principal components in
      the EO from S. montana, and sabinene (49.23%) and alpha-pinene (13.81%) were
      found in the EO from M. fragrans. Geranial (59.66%) and neral (38.98%) isomers
      were the only major components in the EO from C. flexuosus. The EO from S.
      montana was effective against E. coli, with minimum inhibitory and bactericidal
      concentrations (MIC and MBC) of 6.25 microl mL(-1) , whereas bactericidal
      potential against both was observed for the EO from M. fragrans; MIC = 6.25 ml
      mL(-1) for S. aureus and MBC = 12.5 microL mL(-1) for E. coli. A significant
      protective role on lipid substrates in the beta-carotene bleaching assay was seen
      for the EO from S. montana and M. fragrans. Overall, such EO can be promising
      agents against pathogenic bacteria and for protecting biomolecules during
      oxidative stress.

TI  - Proteomic analysis revealed the biofilm-degradation abilities of the
      bacteriophage UPMK_1 and UPMK_2 against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus.
LID - 10.1007/s10529-022-03229-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The degradation activity of two bacteriophages UPMK_1 and UPMK_2
      against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus phages were examined using
      gel zymography. METHODS: The analysis was done using BLASTP to detect peptides
      catalytic domains. Many peptides that are related to several phage proteins were 
      revealed. RESULTS: UPMK_1 and UPMK_2 custom sequence database were used for
      peptide identification. The biofilm-degrading proteins in the bacteriophage
      UPMK_2 revealed the same lytic activity towards polysaccharide intercellular
      adhesin-dependent and independent of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
      (MRSA) biofilm producers in comparison to UPMK_1, which had lytic activity
      restricted solely to its host. CONCLUSION: Both bacteriophage enzymes were
      involved in MRSA biofilm degradation during phage infection and they have
      promising enzybiotics properties against MRSA biofilm formation.

AB  - Various materials are used in bone tissue engineering (BTE). Graphene oxide (GO) 
      is a good candidate for BTE due to its antibacterial activity and
      biocompatibility. In this study, an innovative biomaterial consists of GO,
      agarose and hydroxyapatite (HA) was synthesized using electrophoresis system. The
      characterization of the synthesized biomaterial showed that needle-like crystals 
      with high purity were formed after 10 mA/10 h of electrophoresis treatment.
      Furthermore, the calcium-phosphate ratio was similar to thermodynamically stable 
      HA. In the synthesized biomaterial with addition of 1.0 wt% of GO, the colony
      forming units test showed significantly less Staphylococcus aureus. Initial
      attachment of MC3T3-E1 cells on the synthesized biomaterial was observed which
      showed the safety of the synthesized biomaterial for cell viability. This study
      showed that the synthesized biomaterial is a promising material that can be used 
      in BTE.

AB  - The multiantibiotic resistant characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus and the
      prevalence of foodborne illnesses due to foods, particularly dairy products,
      contaminated by the pathogen call for alternative preservation technologies.
      Essential oils (EOs) have shown activities against various bacterial pathogens.
      However, EOs are water-insoluble and have unpleasant sensory properties, and
      strategies are needed to prepare colloidal systems for dispersion in liquid
      products and increase their antimicrobial activity and therefore reduce their
      usage level. In the present study, the overall objective was to fabricate and
      characterize self-emulsified nanoemulsions containing multiple EOs with
      synergistic antibacterial activities. Cinnamon, lemongrass, oregano, and tea tree
      EOs were observed to have synergistic antibacterial activities when used in
      combinations, especially for their triple combinations showing the fractional
      inhibitory concentration index of 0.625 and below. When triple EOs were
      emulsified by the combination of sunflower lecithin and Tween 20, mixing EOs with
      corn oil enabled the preparation of translucent oil-in-water nanoemulsions by
      simply stirring the mixtures. Three formulations were chosen for the preparation 
      of self-emulsified nanoemulsions as these systems remained translucent, the
      droplet diameter remained to be smaller than 200 nm, and the polydispersity index
      remained to be smaller than 0.3 after 180-day ambient storage at 21 degrees C.
      The oil: surfactant mass ratio in these nanoemulsions (1.16 or higher) was higher
      than that of EO microemulsions (up to 0.77) prepared with a similar method. The
      minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the nanoemulsions remained to be 0.5 or
      1.0 mg/mL against S. aureus, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC)
      remained to be 1.0 or 2.0 mg/mL after the 180-day storage. A higher EO:
      surfactant mass ratio of nanoemulsions resulted in a lower MIC and MBC. When
      tested in whole milk with 3.3% fat at 21 degrees C, no inhibition of S. aureus
      was observed for nanoemulsions at overall EO levels of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/mL; at an
      overall EO concentration of 7.5 mg/mL, no inhibition was observed for one
      nanoemulsion with the lowest EO:(corn oil + surfactant) mass ratio, while the
      gradual reduction of S. aureus by ~1 or 2 log CFU/mL in 120 h was observed for
      the other two nanoemulsions. The formulations and nanoemulsion preparation method
      in the present study may be significant to the utilization of EOs as natural
      preservatives to improve food safety.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are widely acknowledged as an alternative class of
      antimicrobial agents. In this study, a lysine-rich scorpion peptide derivative
      Pacavin-5K was designed, which showed an improved antibacterial spectrum,
      significantly higher antibacterial activity, and lower toxicity compared to the
      native peptide. It also showed an improved thermal and serum stability. Notably, 
      Pacavin-5K significantly decreased the bacterial counts in the wounded region in 
      the mouse cutaneous infection model caused by Staphylococcus aureus and
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, Pacavin-5K did not induce bacterial resistance 
      associated with its antibacterial mechanism disrupting the membrane. Furthermore,
      Pacavin-5K could kill the S. aureus cells at the biofilm state. Overall,
      Pacavin-5K could be a potential alternative antibacterial agent against skin
      infection caused by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.

AB  - A gellan-polylysine (GPL) fiber was prepared by wet spinning molding with gellan 
      solution containing glucose, soybean peptide, fish collagen peptide as spinning
      liquid, and epsilon-poly-l-lysine as fixative liquid. Results showed that the
      material addition order affects the spinning and an acceptable material addition 
      order was as follows: soybean peptides -->glucose --> fish collagen peptides. The
      mechanical strength of the GPL fiber decreased with the collagen peptide titer
      and the fiber strength can reach 0.99 cN/dtex. In addition, the GPL fiber showed 
      comparable water absorption capacity. The GPL fiber demonstrated good
      antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The 
      GPL fiber also had no cytotoxicity on mouse embryo fibroblast L-929 cells and
      could effectively promote wound healing for rats. As a result, the bifunctional
      edible GPL fiber is potentially used as a military and rescue emergency
      equipment.

AB  - Ammonia dependent NAD(+) synthetase from multi drug resistance Staphylococcus
      aureus catalyzes ATP dependent formation of NAD(+) from deamido-NAD(+) and
      ammonia at the synthetase active site. Binding of ATP accompanies a large
      movement of flexible loop region (205-225) acting as a lid to the catalytic core.
      A 17 A long ammonia tunnel with an entry and exit radius of 3.5 A and 3.2 A
      respectively allows transfer of ammonia from surface to the active site of the
      enzyme in each monomer to attack the C7N=O7N linkage of transient intermediate
      NAD-adenylate thus releasing NAD(+). In this study, we report structural details 
      of ammonia transport tunnel in Staphylococcus aureus NH3-dependent NAD synthetase
      and compared their architecture and dynamics with other bacterial and eukaryotic 
      enzymes. Tunnel shows conformational variations in apo and substrate complexes
      and is less intricate compared to glutamine dependent counterparts. We have also 
      performed steered molecular dynamic simulations of ammonia transport across the
      tunnel in enzyme-intermediate complex which reveals critical bottleneck residues 
      and structural determinants during ammonium migration. Ordered water molecules
      and conserved charged residues form a network of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic
      interaction which facilitate the ammonium movement towards the active center.
      Analysis of the sMD simulated structural snapshots delineates the conformational 
      reshaping of ammonia tunnel at the different step of the enzymatic reaction.
      Tunnel architecture and environment could offer the new target site to design
      novel small molecule inhibitors for the development of more efficient
      therapeutics against multi drug resistant S. aureus strains.

      cutaneous inflammation and infection.
PG  - eabi9126
LID - 10.1126/sciimmunol.abi9126 [doi]
AB  - Neutrophils are the first nonresident effector immune cells that migrate to a
      site of infection or inflammation; however, improper control of neutrophil
      responses can cause considerable tissue damage. Here, we found that neutrophil
      responses in inflamed or infected skin were regulated by CCR7-dependent migration
      and phagocytosis of neutrophils in draining lymph nodes (dLNs). In mouse models
      of Toll-like receptor-induced skin inflammation and cutaneous Staphylococcus
      aureus infection, neutrophils migrated from the skin to the dLNs via lymphatic
      vessels in a CCR7-mediated manner. In the dLNs, these neutrophils were
      phagocytosed by lymph node-resident type 1 and type 2 conventional dendritic
      cells. CCR7 up-regulation on neutrophils was a conserved mechanism across
      different tissues and was induced by a broad range of microbial stimuli. In the
      context of cutaneous immune responses, disruption of CCR7 interactions by
      selective CCR7 deficiency of neutrophils resulted in increased antistaphylococcal
      immunity and aggravated skin inflammation. Thus, neutrophil homing to and
      clearance in skin-dLNs affects cutaneous immunity versus pathology.

TI  - Potent, Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial Effects of
      S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine-Impregnated Nitric Oxide-Releasing Latex Urinary 
      Catheters.
LID - 10.1021/acsabm.1c01130 [doi]
AB  - Although numerous prevention and intervention techniques have been developed to
      counteract catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), urinary
      catheters remain one of the most common sources of hospital-acquired infections. 
      Nitric oxide (NO), a gaseous free radical responsible for regulating many
      physiological functions in the body, has gained immense popularity due to its
      potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which is capable of combating
      medical device-associated infections. In this work, a straightforward
      solvent-swelling method was used to load the NO donor
      S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) into commercial latex catheters
      (SNAP-UCs) for the first time. The effects of swelling catheters with different
      concentrations of SNAP solutions (25-125 mg/mL SNAP in tetrahydrofuran (THF))
      were studied by measuring the NO release kinetics, SNAP loading, and SNAP
      leaching. SNAP-UCs impregnated with a 50 mg/mL SNAP-THF solution were found to
      maximize the amount of SNAP loaded into the latex (0.115 +/- 0.009 mg SNAP/mg
      catheter) and showed physiological levels of NO release (>2 x 10(-10) mol min(-1)
      cm(-2)) over 7 days and minimal SNAP leaching (<2%). SNAP-UCs showed impressive
      in vitro contact-based and diffusible antimicrobial efficacy against three
      CAUTI-associated pathogens, reducing the viability of adhered and planktonic
      Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus by approximately
      98.0 to 99.1% (adhered) and 86.3-96.3% (planktonic) compared to control latex
      catheters. In vitro cytotoxicity against 3T3 mouse fibroblasts using a CCK-8
      assay showed that SNAP-UCs were noncytotoxic (>90% viability). In summary,
      SNAP-UCs show stable, noncytotoxic NO release characteristics capable of potent, 
      broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, demonstrating great potential for reducing
      the devastating effects associated with CAUTIs.

TI  - Low albumin level is more strongly associated with adverse outcomes and

LID - 10.1002/jor.25282 [doi]
AB  - Postsurgical deep musculoskeletal infections are a major clinical problem in
      Orthopaedic Surgery. A serum-based nomogram, which can objectively risk-stratify 
      patients, and aid surgeons in delineating infection risk associated with
      orthopedic surgical interventions, would be immensely helpful. Here, we
      constructed a multi-parametric nomogram based on serum anti-Staphylococcus aureus
      antibody responses, patient characteristics including demographics and standard
      clinical tests. This nomogram was formally tested in a prospective cohort study
      comparing 303 hospitalized patients with culture-confirmed S. aureus infection
      compared with a cohort of 223 healthy screened preoperative patients. Serum
      anti-S. aureus antibody responses, standard of care clinical tests, and patient
      demographic data were utilized to perform multivariate logistic regression
      analysis to quantify the presence of infection and adverse outcome using odds
      ratios (OR) and to assess predictive ability via area under the ROC curve (AUC). 
      At enrollment, high anti-S. aureus IgG titers were predictive of infection.
      Remarkably, low serum albumin was found to be significantly associated with
      infection (OR = 479.963, 95% CI 61.59 - 3740.33, p < 0.0001) and this finding was
      surprisingly higher than BMI or HbA1c-associations. Combining all risk factors in
      the nomogram yielded a diagnostic AUC of 0.949 for predicting S. aureus
      infection. Our results indicate that a serum-based multi-parametric nomogram can 
      be useful in diagnosing S. aureus infections, and importantly, malnourishment is 
      significantly associated with these infections.

TI  - Polymyxin and lipopeptide antibiotics: membrane-targeting drugs of last resort.
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.001136 [doi]
AB  - The polymyxin and lipopeptide classes of antibiotics are membrane-targeting drugs
      of last resort used to treat infections caused by multi-drug-resistant pathogens.
      Despite similar structures, these two antibiotic classes have distinct modes of
      action and clinical uses. The polymyxins target lipopolysaccharide in the
      membranes of most Gram-negative species and are often used to treat infections
      caused by carbapenem-resistant species such as Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter
      baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. By contrast, the lipopeptide daptomycin
      requires membrane phosphatidylglycerol for activity and is only used to treat
      infections caused by drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria such as
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
      However, despite having distinct targets, both antibiotic classes cause membrane 
      disruption, are potently bactericidal in vitro and share similarities in
      resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, there are concerns about the efficacy of
      these antibiotics, and there is increasing interest in using both polymyxins and 
      daptomycin in combination therapies to improve patient outcomes. In this review
      article, we will explore what is known about these distinct but structurally
      similar classes of antibiotics, discuss recent advances in the field and
      highlight remaining gaps in our knowledge.

TI  - Platelets mediate trained immunity against bone and joint infections in a mouse
      model.
PG  - 73-81
LID - 10.1302/2046-3758.112.BJR-2021-0279.R1 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Trained immunity confers non-specific protection against various types of
      infectious diseases, including bone and joint infection. Platelets are active
      participants in the immune response to pathogens and foreign substances, but
      their role in trained immunity remains elusive. METHODS: We first trained the
      innate immune system of C57BL/6 mice via intravenous injection of two toll-like
      receptor agonists (zymosan and lipopolysaccharide). Two, four, and eight weeks
      later, we isolated platelets from immunity-trained and control mice, and then
      assessed whether immunity training altered platelet releasate. To better
      understand the role of immunity-trained platelets in bone and joint infection
      development, we transfused platelets from immunity-trained mice into naive mice, 
      and then challenged the recipient mice with Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia 
      coli. RESULTS: After immunity training, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
      (tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-17A) and chemokines
      (CCL5, CXCL4, CXCL5, CXCL7, CXCL12) increased significantly in platelet
      releasate, while the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-13)
      decreased. Other platelet-secreted factors (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor
      (PDGF)-AA, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, cathepsin D, serotonin, and histamine) were
      statistically indistinguishable between the two groups. Transfusion of platelets 
      from trained mice into naive mice reduced infection risk and bacterial burden
      after local or systemic challenge with either S. aureus or E. coli. CONCLUSION:
      Immunity training altered platelet releasate by increasing the levels of
      inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and decreasing the levels of anti-inflammatory 
      cytokines. Transfusion of platelets from immunity-trained mice conferred
      protection against bone and joint infection, suggesting that alteration of
      platelet releasate might be an important mechanism underlying trained immunity
      and may have clinical implications. Cite this article: Bone Joint Res

      Infections.
PG  - 199-204
LID - 10.1016/j.artd.2021.10.015 [doi]
AB  - Background: Modular knee arthrodesis (MKA) is a salvage treatment option for
      patients with challenging periprosthetic joint infections (PJI). The purpose of
      this study was to investigate the outcomes of patients who underwent MKA for PJI 
      with a single technique and determine if specific factors are associated with MKA
      failure. Methods: This was a retrospective review of 81 patients who underwent
      MKA at a single institution. Knee Society Scores were recorded before MKA and at 
      the final follow-up (mean 52 months). Poisson regression was used to calculate
      rate ratios for MKA failure secondary to infection. Results: The mean patient age
      was 67 years; most patients were McPherson B hosts (56.8%) and had type 3
      extremities (53.1%), and all had a type III infection (chronic, >4 wks).
      Forty-six percent of patients had a prior explantation (59.5% failed 2-stage,
      40.5% failed spacer). Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus were
      the most common organisms, 22.2% and 18.5%, respectively. Thirty percent of
      patients had at least one reoperation, excluding reimplantation (14.8% irrigation
      and debridement/wound closure, 9.9% MKA exchange, and 7.4% amputation). Of 82.7% 
      of MKA patients with no evidence of infection, 82.1% (56 patients) underwent
      reimplantation endoprosthetic reconstruction, and 67.3% of these remained
      infection-free at the final follow-up. Discussion: MKA is a salvage option for
      challenging PJI cases that may serve as definitive surgical management or as a
      bridge to endoprosthetic reconstruction for patients who have failed prior
      infection control procedures.

AB  - Mechanisms that target and destroy foreign nucleic acids are major barriers to
      horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in prokaryotes. Amongst them,
      restriction-modification (R-M) systems are found in >/=75% of the sequenced
      genomes in Bacteria and Archaea. Due to their high target sequence specificity
      and potent nucleolytic activity, R-M systems are used as a paradigm to elucidate 
      the mechanisms of DNA binding and cleavage. Since these enzymes modulate HGT,
      they are one of the machineries implicated in the ability of a bacterium to gain 
      antibiotic resistance. This protocol provides a detailed purification strategy
      for the Type IV restriction endonuclease SauUSI from Staphylococcus aureus. This 
      protocol eventually leads to >/=95% purity of protein which can then be used for 
      crystallographic and biochemical purposes. Graphic abstract: Workflow for
      purification of SauUSI.

TI  - Bioinformatics analysis on enrichment analysis of potential hub genes in breast
      cancer.
PG  - 2399-2408
LID - 10.21037/tcr-21-749 [doi]
AB  - Background: Despite recent advances in screening, treatment, and survival, breast
      cancer remains the most invasive cancer in women. The development of novel
      diagnostic and therapeutic markers for breast cancer may provide more information
      about its pathogenesis and progression. Methods: We obtained GSE86374
      micro-expression matrix chip data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database
      consisting of 159 samples (124 normal samples and 35 breast cancer samples). The 
      language was then used to perform data processing and differential expression
      analysis. For all differentially expressed genes (DEGs), "FDR <0.01 and |logFC|
      >/=1" were selected as thresholds. Results: In this study, 173 up-regulated genes
      and 143 down-regulated genes were selected for GO and KEGG enrichment analysis.
      These genes are also significantly enriched in the KEGG pathway, including
      phenylalanine metabolism, staphylococcus aureus infection, and the PPAR signaling
      pathway. The survival and prognosis of the selected eight key genes (DLGAP5,
      PRC1, TOP2A, CENPF, RACGAP1, RRM2, PLK1, and ASPM) were analyzed by the
      Kaplan-Meier plotter database. Conclusions: Eight hub genes and pathways closely 
      related to the onset and progression of breast cancer were identified. We found
      that the PPAR signaling pathway, especially PPARgamma, plays an important role in
      breast cancer and suggest this pathway be the subject of further research.

PG  - 1854473

AB  - Iron oxide and titania-based composite nanoparticles (NPs) populated with
      core-shell structures, as part of the mixture of the monometallic NPs, were
      prepared in water medium by the two-fluence LASER ablation technique by applying 
      30 and 60 mJ/cm(2) LASER energy irradiations. The prepared monometallics,
      composite, and core-shell NPs structures were confirmed from the XRD, TEM, and
      EDX analyses, followed by the FE-SEM and UV absorptions. Optically, the NPs
      exhibited an increase in the energy gap from 3.27 eV to 3.75 eV as LASER fluence 
      increased from 30 mJ/cm(2) to 60 mJ/cm(2). The average NPs core size
      distributions for the core-shell material ranged at approximately 70 nm with the 
      shell thickness around 20 nm. The biggest NPs were of approximately 170 nm size
      which were sparsely distributed. The magnetization behaviors of the NPs were also
      investigated using the vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The NPs showed
      antimicrobial activities against the pathogenic species: Escherichia coli and
      Staphylococcus aureus. The antimicrobial activities of the synthesized NPs,
      synthesized under the influence of magnetic fields, were found to be more potent 
      than the NPs synthesized without the presence of any magnetic field. The NPs
      prepared under the influence of the magnetic fields also comparatively exhibited 
      higher levels of cytotoxicity against lung cancer cell lines (A549) than the NPs 
      prepared under no magnetic field's influence by the similar energy level effects 
      of the LASER fluence. The flow cytometry analyses confirmed the NPs' cytotoxic
      impacts against the human lung cancer A549 cell lines through the initiation of
      apoptosis and promotion of the cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase of cell
      division. To further confirm the cytotoxic effects and the mechanism of the
      anticancer activity of the synthesized NPs against the A549 cell lines, several
      related parameters (cell viability, membrane permeability, nuclear intensity, and
      cytochrome-C release) were analyzed using the high-content screening (HCS) assay.
      The study suggested that the prepared NPs have potential as antimicrobial and
      also as anti-lung-cancer agents as tested in vitro. These NPs can also be part of
      combined chemotherapy in different oncological interventions, as well as a
      sonosensitizer in sonomagnetic heating-based therapy, especially for cancers.

      Calcified Mitral Annular Abscess Misdiagnosed as Klebsiella pneumoniae
      Endocarditis".
PG  - 818219
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2021.818219 [doi]
AB  - Infective endocarditis (IE) involving mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a
      rare disease, but is potentially lethal due to frequent serious periannular
      complications, and therefore requires early diagnosis and prompt treatment.
      However, either reaching the correct diagnosis or the detection of periannular
      complications, even with conventional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE),
      remains challenging because calcium deposition obscures clear visualization of
      the area around the MAC. We describe a unique case of methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) IE involving a calcified mitral annular abscess,
      which was initially misdiagnosed as Klebsiella pneumoniae IE. Accurate diagnosis 
      of MAC-related IE as well as detection of the annular abscess were made possible 
      by 4D TEE, leading to successful cardiac surgery, which confirmed MRSA IE
      pathologically, and the associated annular abscess. This case highlights the
      usefulness of 4D TEE for the accurate diagnosis and proper surgical planning. In 
      addition, this case raises the limitations of the modified Duke criteria in cases
      of definite IE with dual bacteremia.

TI  - Antimicrobial Resistance Among Pathogens Causing Bloodstream Infections: A
      Multicenter Surveillance Report Over 20 Years (1998-2017).
PG  - 249-260
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S344875 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a common consequence of infectious
      diseases and cause high morbidity and mortality. Appropriate antibiotic use is
      critical for patients' treatment and prognosis. Long-term monitoring and analysis
      of antimicrobial resistance are important in guiding physicians to choose
      appropriate antibiotics and understand the changes in antimicrobial resistance
      and infection control. Here, we report a retrospective study on the trends of
      antimicrobial resistance in the common BSI-associated pathogens. Methods: The
      identification of strains and antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed
      in each anticipating hospital independently. Data from the Hubei Province
      Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (HBARSS) from 1998 to 2017 were
      retrospectively analyzed using WHONET 5.6 software. Results: Data from HBARSS
      (1998-2017) revealed that 40,518 Gram-positive bacteria and 26,568 Gram-negative 
      bacteria caused BSIs, the most common of which were Staphylococcus aureus and
      Escherichia coli. Salmonella typhi was a predominant BSI-associated pathogen in
      1998-2003. Antimicrobial susceptibility data showed that the resistance rates of 
      E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae to cefotaxime were significantly higher than
      those to ceftazidime. The proportion of strains of special antimicrobial
      resistance phenotypes including difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR),
      carbapenem-resistant (CR), extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant (ECR) and
      fluoroquinolone resistant (FQR) in E. coli was 0.18%, 0.26%, 13.95%, 22.78% while
      in K. pneumoniae was 11.95%, 14.00%, 31.91% and 11.40%, respectively. In
      2013-2017, K. pneumoniae showed resistance levels reaching 15.8% and 17.5% to
      imipenem and meropenem, respectively, and Acinetobacter baumannii showed high
      resistance rates ranging from 60 to 80% to common antibiotics. The detection rate
      of Salmonella typhi resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and
      fluoroquinolones was less than 5%. Control of methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remains a major challenge, and in 2009-2017, the
      MRSA detection rate was 40-50%. Conclusion: Prevalence of CR K. pneumoniae has
      increased significantly in recent years. Resistance rates of A. baumannii to
      common antimicrobial agents have increased exponentially, reaching high levels.
      MRSA remains a challenge to control. For K. pneumoniae, DTR, CR, ECR and FQR were
      antimicrobial resistance phenotypes that could not be ignored while for E. coli
      DTR and CR were rare antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. CR K. pneumoniae, A.
      baumannii and MRSA present major challenges for controlling BSIs.

TI  - Nanobubble Ozone Stored in Hyaluronic Acid Decorated Liposomes: Antibacterial,
      Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Effect and Biocompatibility Tests.
PG  - 351-379
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S328090 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals may be asymptomatic, and therefore, the 
      virus is highly contagious. We aimed to develop an agent to control viral
      replication in the upper respiratory tract and to prevent progression of the
      disease into the lower airways as well as inter-individual transmission. For this
      purpose, we investigated the antibacterial and antiviral activities of our novel 
      nanobubble ozonated hyaluronic acid-decorated liposomal (NOHAL) solution,
      developed by using nanotechnology. Methods: The MIC levels of NOHAL solution were
      determined on blood agar cultures of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538),
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922). The in
      vitro anti-viral activity of NOHAL solution was studied using recombinant
      SARS-CoV-2 copies of the original virus, grown in Vero cells generated by reverse
      genetic technology. Human primary lung epithelial cells obtained by bronchoscopy 
      or lung resection were used for cell viability tests using flow cytometry
      analysis. The cytotoxicity testing was performed using the BALB/c 3T3 (CCL-163)
      cell line. Skin, oral, nasal and ocular irritation tests were performed using New
      Zealand albino rabbits, Syrian hamsters, BALB c mice and New Zealand albino
      rabbits of both sexes. Results: Bacterial growth was prevented by NOHAL solution 
      in a time-/dose-dependent manner. In vivo or in vitro experiments did not show
      any toxicity of NOHAL solution. No cytotoxicity was recorded on cell viability.
      No skin, oral, nasal or ocular toxicities were recorded. In addition, in a
      SARS-CoV-2 mouse infection model, NOHAL solution diminished the viral RNA levels 
      effectively in nasopharyngeal and lung samples after its prophylactic intranasal 
      application. Conclusion: NOHAL solution has the potential to reduce or prevent
      the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the nose and/or oral cavity. The clinical
      efficacy of this solution needs to be tested in order to determine its efficacy
      in the early phase of COVID-19.

LID - 10.1038/s41429-022-00510-0 [doi]
AB  - Four new pestalone-type benzophenones, pestalotinones A-D (1-4), along with six
      known congeners, pestalone, pestalone E-F, SB87-Cl, SB87-H, and pestalachloride
      B, were isolated from the endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis trachicarpicola
      SC-J551 cultivated on rice grains. Their structures were established by extensive
      spectroscopic analysis. Compounds 1-3 exhibited potent activity against
      Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA (MIC: 1.25-2.5 mug ml(-1)) while no cytotoxicity
      against Vero cells (IC50 > 50 muM). The activity profile of this group of
      compounds suggested that replacement of the C-14 aldehyde with an oxymethyl
      greatly increases their activity and selectivity towards the bacteria and
      chlorine substitutions result in the increase of antibacterial activity and
      slight decrease of cytotoxicity against the mammalian cells.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has greatly impacted medical
      care practices. Although the effects on infectious disease treatment and
      infection control, such as antimicrobial resistance, have been specified, very
      few reports exist on the specific effects of COVID-19. METHODS: We investigated
      the effects of COVID-19 on daily medical practices at a tertiary hospital in
      Japan by comparing the use of hand sanitizers, the detection of bacteria from
      blood cultures, and the amount dose of antibacterial drugs used for one year
      before (April 2019 to March 2020, fiscal year 2019.) and after COVID-19
      admissions began (April 2020 to March 2021, fiscal year 2020). RESULTS: The use
      of hand sanitizers increased by 1.4-3 times during the year after COVID-19
      admissions began; the incidence of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 
      and all S. aureus detected in blood cultures reduced in all departments. No
      decrease was observed in the usage of all antibacterial drugs; rather, the usage 
      of all antibacterial drugs tended to increase in all departments. Therefore, no
      significant change was observed in the detection of drug-resistant bacteria and
      the trends of antibacterial drug use based on the acceptance of COVID-19
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria and trends of
      antibacterial drug use remained unchanged despite the increased use of hand
      sanitizers due to the admission of patients with COVID-19.

TI  - A prospective multicentre screening study on multidrug-resistant organisms in
      intensive care units in the Dutch-German cross-border region, 2017 to 2018: the
      importance of healthcare structures.
LID - 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.5.2001660 [doi]
AB  - BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance poses a risk for healthcare, both in the
      community and hospitals. The spread of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs)
      occurs mostly on a local and regional level, following movement of patients, but 
      also occurs across national borders.AimThe aim of this observational study was to
      determine the prevalence of MDROs in a European cross-border region to understand
      differences and improve infection prevention based on real-time routine data and 
      workflows.MethodsBetween September 2017 and June 2018, 23 hospitals in the Dutch 
      (NL)-German (DE) cross-border region (BR) participated in the study. During 8
      consecutive weeks, patients were screened upon admission to intensive care units 
      (ICUs) for nasal carriage of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
      and rectal carriage of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium/E. faecalis
      (VRE), third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (3GCRE) and
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). All samples were processed in the 
      associated laboratories.ResultsA total of 3,365 patients were screened (median
      age: 68 years (IQR: 57-77); male/female ratio: 59.7/40.3; NL-BR: n=1,202; DE-BR: 
      n=2,163). Median screening compliance was 60.4% (NL-BR: 56.9%; DE-BR: 62.9%).
      MDRO prevalence was higher in DE-BR than in NL-BR, namely 1.7% vs 0.6% for MRSA
      (p = 0.006), 2.7% vs 0.1% for VRE (p < 0.001) and 6.6% vs 3.6% for 3GCRE (p <
      0.001), whereas CRE prevalence was comparable (0.2% in DE-BR vs 0.0% in NL-BR
      ICUs).ConclusionsThis first prospective multicentre screening study in a European
      cross-border region shows high heterogenicity in MDRO carriage prevalence in
      NL-BR and DE-BR ICUs. This indicates that the prevalence is probably influenced
      by the different healthcare structures.

TI  - The need to improve antimicrobial susceptibility testing capacity in Ugandan
      health facilities: insights from a surveillance primer.
PG  - 23
LID - 10.1186/s13756-022-01072-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lab-based surveillance (LBS) of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is not
      systematically implemented in Uganda. We aimed to identify the gaps in
      establishing regular LBS of AMR in Uganda. METHODS: This was a retrospective
      records review. It was done at Mulago Hospital (MH) Microbiology Lab (MHL). It
      analyzed lab records on bacteria and their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles 
      (ASPs) over 6 months. Since MH is the national referral hospital, we hypothesized
      that (1) MHL is the best resourced and that any limitations seen here are
      amplified in labs at regional referral hospitals (RRHs) and health centers (HCs);
      (2) data from MHL on LBS mirrors that from labs at RRHs and HCs; (3) the state of
      records from MHL show lab performance and the presence or absence of standard
      operating procedures (SOPs), as would be the case at RRHs and HCs. RESULTS: The
      lab got 1760 samples over the six months. The most common sample was urine (659, 
      37.4%). From the 1760 samples, data on 478 bacterial isolates were available.
      Urine gave the most isolates (159, 33.3%). Most of the isolates were
      gram-negative (267, 55.9%). Escherichia coli (100, 37%) was the most common
      gram-negative (of the Enterobacteriaceae). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17, 6%) was
      the most common gram-negative (of the non-Enterobacteriaceae). The gram-negative 
      bacteria were highly resistant to beta-lactams. These were highly sensitive to
      carbapenems. The Staphylococcus aureus were highly resistant to beta-lactams. The
      gram-positive bacteria were highly sensitive to vancomycin. ASPs for all
      bacterial categories were incomplete. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from MHL suggest 
      that there is a need to improve antimicrobial susceptibility testing capacity.
      They also suggest that the situation at RRHs and HCs around the country could be 
      worse. So, there is a need to extend the political will, which already exists,
      into operational and implementation action.

TI  - Blood culture surveillance in a secondary care hospital in Benin: epidemiology of
      bloodstream infection pathogens and antimicrobial resistance.
PG  - 119
LID - 10.1186/s12879-022-07077-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although global surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is
      considered key in the containment of AMR, data from low- and middle-income
      countries, especially from sub-Saharan Africa, are scarce. This study describes
      epidemiology of bloodstream infections and antimicrobial resistance rates in a
      secondary care hospital in Benin. METHODS: Blood cultures were sampled, according
      to predefined indications, in BacT/ALERT FA Plus and PF Plus (bioMerieux,
      Marcy-l'Etoile, France) blood culture bottles (BCB) in a district hospital (Boko 
      hospital) and to a lesser extent in the University hospital of Parakou. These BCB
      were incubated for 7 days in a standard incubator and twice daily inspected for
      visual signs of growth. Isolates retrieved from the BCB were processed locally
      and later shipped to Belgium for reference identification [matrix-assisted laser 
      desorption/ionization time-of-flight spectrometry (MALDI-TOF)] and antibiotic
      susceptibility testing (disk diffusion and E-tests). RESULTS: From October 2017
      to February 2020, 3353 BCB were sampled, corresponding to 3140 blood cultures
      (212 cultures consisting of > 1 BCB) and 3082 suspected bloodstream infection
      (BSI) episodes. Most of these cultures (n = 2471; 78.7%) were sampled in children
      < 15 years of age. Pathogens were recovered from 383 (12.4%) cultures,
      corresponding to 381 confirmed BSI. 340 of these pathogens were available and
      confirmed by reference identification. The most common pathogens were Klebsiella 
      pneumoniae (n = 53; 15.6%), Salmonella Typhi (n = 52; 15.3%) and Staphylococcus
      aureus (n = 46; 13.5%). AMR rates were high among Enterobacterales, with
      resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in 77.6% of K. pneumoniae isolates 
      (n = 58), 12.8% of Escherichia coli isolates (n = 49) and 70.5% of Enterobacter
      cloacae isolates (n = 44). Carbapenemase production was detected in 2 Escherichia
      coli and 2 Enterobacter cloacae isolates, all of which were of the New Delhi
      metallo-beta lactamase type. Methicillin resistance was present in 22.4% of S.
      aureus isolates (n = 49). CONCLUSION: Blood cultures were successfully
      implemented in a district hospital in Benin, especially among the pediatric
      patient population. Unexpectedly high rates of AMR among Gram-negative bacteria
      against commonly used antibiotics were found, demonstrating the clinical and
      scientific importance of clinical bacteriology laboratories at this level of
      care.

AB  - The aim of this work was to monitor the potential antibiofilm properties of
      biosurfactants (BS) isolated from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 3/22 against biofilm
      formation of the indicator strain Staphylococcus aureus CCM 4223. In this work,
      the effect of BS 3/22 on biofilm growth during co-incubation, inhibition of
      biofilm-forming cell adhesion and biofilm dispersion was studied. BS 3/22
      inhibited biofilm formation, with its formation decreasing significantly (p &lt; 
      0.05; p &lt; 0.01; p &lt; 0.001) with increasing BS 3/22 concentration. BS 3/22
      also showed antiadhesive activity, which correlated with the concentration used. 
      The dispersing effect of isolated BS 3/22 on a 24-hour biofilm was also detected.
      BS 3/22 were effective in biofilm dispersion even at lower concentrations
      compared to antiadhesive activity and inhibition of biofilm formation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) has emerged as a superior form of local 
      anesthetic across numerous surgical subspecialties. The purpose of this study is 
      to evaluate the ex-vivo antimicrobial effects of LB in comparison with
      traditional local anesthetics. METHODS: A standardized inoculum of bacteria
      commonly associated with surgical site infection was inoculated into a suspension
      of 1% lidocaine, 0.25% bupivacaine, Exparel (proprietary liposomally packaged
      1.3% bupivacaine), and normal saline as a growth control. RESULTS: In all five
      bacteria tested, the medium inoculated with traditional local anesthetics reduced
      growth to a greater degree than LB-inoculated plates. Both conventional local
      anesthetics reduced the growth of all bacteria when compared with the control
      with the exception of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus growth in
      bupivacaine. LB-inoculated plates had equivalent growth to the control in all
      plates with the exception of Escherichia coli plates which demonstrated superior 
      growth. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this simple ex-vivo model suggest that the
      liposomal packaging of bupivacaine may decrease this local anesthetic's innate
      antibacterial properties.

AB  - Phyto-derived silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were modified by three antibiotics
      including penicillin, amoxicillin, and tetracycline to measure antibacterial
      activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. According to disc
      diffusion assay, Staphylococcus aureus exhibited a higher sensitivity compared to
      Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa under AgNPs/tetracycline stress.
      Damage of the cell envelops of S. aureus and E. coli as sensitive bacteria under 
      MIC concentrations of Ag NPs/tetracycline was observed by SEM images. AFM
      technique showed a smaller size of albumin protein (8-13nm) with a higher level
      of roughness equals to 74.87nm relative to hemoglubin (5-6.9nm) by roughness
      value of 47.04nm. Interaction of main secondary metabolites includes nootkatone, 
      nootkatin, daphnauranol C, alpha-Cyperone, (E)-Nerolidol, and
      (Z)-alpha-Bisabolene epoxide surrounding phyto-derived AgNPs with the binding
      cavities of exfoliative toxin A and exfoliative toxin B as virulence factors of
      S. aureus was evaluated by molecular docking study. Among these natural
      compounds, daphnauranol C had the suitable binding affinity as value of -
      6.4kcal/mol compared with other metabolites. Based on the results of this study, 
      tetracycline and daphanuranol C can be considered to further evaluations to
      obtain novel formulation of AgNPs as an efficient weapon against bacterial
      infections.

TI  - Zinc-Doping Induces Evolution of Biocompatible Strontium-Calcium-Phosphate
      Conversion Coating on Titanium to Improve Antibacterial Property.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.1c23631 [doi]
AB  - Implant-associated infections (IAI) remains a common and devastating complication
      in orthopedic surgery. To reduce the incidence of IAI, implants with intrinsic
      antibacterial activity have been proposed. The surface functionalization and
      structure optimization of metallic implants can be achieved by surface
      modification using the phosphate chemical conversion (PCC) technique. Zinc (Zn)
      has strong antibacterial behavior toward a broad-spectrum of bacteria. Herein, Zn
      was incorporated into strontium-calcium-phosphate (SrCaP) coatings on titanium
      (Ti) via PCC method, and the influence of its doping amount on the phase,
      microstructure, antibacterial activity, and biocompatibility of the composite
      coating was researched. The results indicated that traces of Zn doping produced
      grain refinement of SrCaP coating with no significant effect on its phase and
      surface properties, while a higher Zn content induced its phase and
      microstructure transformed into zinc-strontium-phosphate (SrZn2(PO4)2). SrCaP-Zn1
      and SrCaP-Zn4 represented trace and high content Zn-doped coatings, respectively,
      which exhibited a similar bacterial attachment for a short time but showed
      inhibition of biofilm formation after continuous incubation up to 24 h. The
      killing rates of SrCaP-Zn1 coating for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and
      Escherichia coli (E. coli) reached 61.25% and 55.38%, respectively. While that
      data increased to 83.01% and 71.28% on SrCaP-Zn4 coating due to the
      more-releasing Zn(2+). Furthermore, in vitro culture of MC3T3-E1 cells proved
      that the Zn-doped coatings also possessed excellent biocompatibility. This study 
      provides a new perception for the phase and microstructural optimization of
      phosphate coatings on implant surfaces, as well as fabricating promising coatings
      with excellent biocompatibility and antimicrobial properties against IAI.

PG  - e0260580
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0260580 [doi]
AB  - Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) remain a serious public health problem.
      In previous work, two models of an intensive care unit (ICU) showed that
      differing population structures had markedly different rates of Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA) transmission. One explanation for this difference is the models
      having differing long-term equilbrium dynamics, resulting from different basic
      reproductive numbers, R0. We find in this system however that this is not the
      case, and that both models had the same value for R0. Instead, short-term,
      transient dynamics, characterizing a series of small, self-limiting outbreaks
      caused by pathogen reintroduction were responsible for the differences. These
      results show the importance of these short-term factors for disease systems where
      reintroduction events are frequent, even if they are below the epidemic
      threshold. Further, we examine how subtle changes in how a hospital is
      organized-or how a model assumes a hospital is organized-in terms of the
      admission of new patients may impact transmission rates. This has implications
      for both novel pathogens introduced into ICUs, such as Ebola, MERS or COVID-19,
      as well as existing healthcare-associated infections such as carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae.

TI  - Eumelanin-Inspired Antimicrobial with Biocidal Activity against
      Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
LID - 10.1021/acsabm.1c01036 [doi]
AB  - The reliance on antibiotics and antimicrobials to treat bacterial infectious
      diseases is threatened by the emergence of antibiotic resistance and
      multi-drug-resistant organisms, thus having the potential to greatly impact human
      health. Thus, the discovery and development of antimicrobials capable of acting
      on antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a major area of significance in scientific
      research. Herein, we present the development of a eumelanin-inspired
      antimicrobial capable of killing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA). By ligating quaternary ammonium-functionalized "arms" to a
      eumelanin-inspired indole with intrinsic antimicrobial activity, an antimicrobial
      agent with enhanced activity was prepared. This resulting antimicrobial, EIPE-1, 
      had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 16 mug/mL (17.1 muM) against a clinical
      isolate of MRSA obtained from an adult cystic fibrosis patient. The biocidal
      activity occurred within 30 min of exposure and resulted in changes to the
      bacterial cell surface as visualized with a scanning electron microscope. Taken
      together, these studies demonstrate that EIPE-1 is effective at killing MRSA.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Multi-decade Antibiotic Resistance Data for Ocular
      Bacterial Pathogens in the United States.
LID - 10.1007/s40123-021-00449-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since 2009, the Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring in Ocular
      Microorganisms (ARMOR) surveillance study has been assessing in vitro antibiotic 
      resistance for bacterial isolates sourced from ocular infections in the US. The
      main goal of this systematic review was to compare in vitro resistance data for
      ocular pathogens from published US studies with the most recently published data 
      from the ARMOR study (2009-2018) and, where possible, to evaluate trends in
      bacterial resistance over time over all studies. METHODS: A literature search was
      conducted using MEDLINE(R), BIOSIS Previews(R), and EMBASE((R)) databases
      (1/1/1995-6/30/2021). Data were extracted from relevant studies and antibiotic
      susceptibility rates for common ocular pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus,
      coagulase-negative staphylococci [CoNS], Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae), longitudinal changes in susceptibility, 
      and multidrug resistance (MDR) were compared descriptively. RESULTS: Thirty-two
      relevant studies were identified. High in vitro resistance was found among S.
      aureus and CoNS to fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and methicillin/oxacillin across
      studies, with high rates of MDR noted, specifically among methicillin-resistant
      staphylococci. Data from studies pre-dating or overlapping the early years of
      ARMOR reflected increasing rates of S. aureus resistance to fluoroquinolones,
      macrolides, methicillin/oxacillin, and aminoglycosides, while the ARMOR data
      suggested slight decreases in resistance to these classes between 2009 and 2018. 
      Overall, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) prevalence peaked from 2005 to
      2015 with a possible decreasing trend in more recent years. DISCUSSION AND
      CONCLUSIONS: Data from local and regional US datasets were generally consistent
      with data from the national ARMOR surveillance study. Continued surveillance of
      ocular bacterial pathogens is needed to track trends such as methicillin
      resistance and MDR prevalence and any new emerging antibiotic resistance
      phenotypes. Susceptibility data from ARMOR can inform initial choice of therapy, 
      especially in practice areas where local antibiograms are unavailable.

TI  - Cost-minimisation analysis of oritavancin for the treatment of acute bacterial
      skin and skin structure infections from a United Kingdom perspective.
LID - 10.1007/s10198-022-01432-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early discharge (ED) from hospital and outpatient parenteral
      antibiotic therapy (OPAT) are effective approaches for the management of a range 
      of infections, including acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections
      (ABSSSI). Strategies that facilitate ED, thereby reducing complications such as
      healthcare-acquired infection whilst enhancing patient quality of life, are being
      increasingly adopted in line with good antimicrobial stewardship practice. This
      study presents a cost-minimisation analysis for the use of oritavancin at ED
      versus relevant comparators from a National Health Service (NHS) and personal and
      social services United Kingdom perspective. METHODS: A cost-minimisation model
      considering adult patients with ABSSSI with suspected or confirmed
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, was developed based
      on publicly available NHS costs, practice guidelines for ABSSSI and clinical
      expert's opinion. Cost of treatment and treatment days were compared for
      oritavancin at ED to dalbavancin, teicoplanin, daptomycin and linezolid. RESULTS:
      Following the empiric use of either flucloxacillin or vancomycin in the inpatient
      setting, oritavancin was compared to OPAT with dalbavancin, teicoplanin and
      daptomycin, and oral linezolid from day 4 of treatment. Oritavancin at ED reduced
      treatment duration by 0.8 days and led to cost savings of pound281 in comparison 
      to dalbavancin. In comparison to teicoplanin, daptomycin and linezolid,
      oritavancin reduced treatment duration by 5 days, with marginally higher costs ( 
      pound446, pound137, and pound1,434, respectively). CONCLUSION: Oritavancin, used 
      to support ED, is associated with lower costs compared with dalbavancin and
      reduced treatment duration relative to all comparators. Its use would support an 
      ED approach in MRSA ABSSSI management.

TI  - Phthalocyanine-Assembled "One-For-Two" Nanoparticles for Combined
      Photodynamic-Photothermal Therapy of Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.1c21891 [doi]
AB  - The treatment of diseases caused by drug-resistant bacterial infections urgently 
      requires new types of broad-spectrum antimicrobial materials. Herein, we
      introduce a supramolecular self-assembly, NanoPcN, which realizes the combination
      of type I photodynamic activity and photothermal effects by modifying zinc(II)
      phthalocyanine with a 3-(dimethylamino) phenoxy group. Antibacterial experiments 
      demonstrate that this "one-for-two" property endows NanoPcN with excellent
      antimicrobial efficacy, not only against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
      but also against multidrug-resistant bacteria. An ultralow concentration of
      NanoPcN (50 nM) almost completely inhibited the growth of methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus upon 655 nm laser irradiation (0.5 W/cm(2)) for 2 min, and 
      the antibacterial effect was significantly stronger than that of the known
      photosensitizers methylene blue and tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonic acid.
      Thus, the construction of "one-for-two" materials through a simple molecular
      structure modification paves a feasible way for the development of effective
      broad-spectrum antibacterial agents.

LID - 10.1002/jbm.b.35027 [doi]
AB  - Integrative production of new nanocomposites has been used to enhance favorable
      features of biomaterials for unlocking ultimate potential of different molecules.
      In the present study, advantageous properties of diamond like carbons (DLC) and
      germanium (Ge) like greater biocompatibility and antibacterial attributes were
      aimed to combined into a thin film. For this purpose, 400 nm DLC-Ge nanocomposite
      was coated on the borosilicate glasses via the magnetron sputtering and surface
      characteristics was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy
      dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and The Raman spectrum. Biocompatibility analysis
      were performed by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl) (MTT) cell viability assay and
      Hoechst 33258 fluorescent staining genotoxicity assessments on the human
      fibroblast cell line (HDFa). Finally, antibacterial properties of DLC-Ge
      nanocomposite coatings were investigated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853)
      and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) bacterial attachment analysis. As a result
      of magnetron sputtering coating, nearly 400 nm thick DLC-Ge nanocomposite film
      showed a smooth, a non-porous, and a dense characteristic. Cell viability
      analysis showed that Ge-DLC coatings permits %95 cell surface growth of
      fibroblast cells. Also, there were no significant difference in aspect of nuclear
      abnormalities compared to the (-) control which showed nonmutagenic features of
      the thin film. Finally, antibacterial attachment analysis put forth that Ge-DLC
      coatings inhibits bacterial adhesion as %40 and %25 rates for P. aeruginosa and
      S. aureus bacterial strains, respectively. From these results, DLC-Ge
      nanocomposites could be proposed as a potential new biomaterial for various
      biomedical applications.

AB  - Bilateral orbital cellulitis is an uncommon presentation in infants, and its
      association with rhinosinusitis has been scantily reported in the literature. An 
      infant underwent bilateral uncinectomy and right ethmoidal decompression for
      bilateral orbital cellulitis with right ethmoidal sinusitis, after a period of
      non-recovery with conservative treatment. Mixed infection with Escherichia coli
      and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was observed. The right eyelid
      swelling began to resolve; however, the left lower eyelid showed an increase in
      the fluctuant swelling. Transconjunctival incision and drainage of pus was done
      in the left eye subsequently. The patient showed marked clinical recovery and is 
      doing well. A multidisciplinary management approach can avert potentially
      life-threatening sequelae of this condition.

TI  - Exposome and Skin. Part 2. The Influential Role of the Exposome, Beyond UVR, in
      Actinic Keratosis, Bowen's Disease and Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Proposal.
LID - 10.1007/s13555-021-00644-3 [doi]
AB  - Actinic keratosis (AK) is the main risk factor for the development of cutaneous
      invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). It represents the first sign of severe
      chronic ultraviolet radiation exposure, which has a clear significant effect.
      Nevertheless, the skin is exposed to many other exposome factors which should be 
      thoroughly considered. Our aim was to assess the impact of exposome factors other
      than ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on the etiopathology of AK and Bowen's disease
      (BD) and progression of AK to SCC and to design tailored prevention strategies.
      We performed an exhaustive literature search in September 2021 through PubMed on 
      the impact of exposome factors other than UVR on AK, BD and SCC. We conducted
      several parallel searches combining terms of the following topics: AK, BD, SCC
      and microbiome, hormones, nutrition, alcohol, tobacco, viral infections, chemical
      contaminants and air pollution. Notably, skin microbiome studies have shown how
      Staphylococcus aureus infections are associated with AK and AK-to-SCC progression
      by the production of chronic inflammation. Nutritional studies have demonstrated 
      how a caloric restriction in fat intake, oral nicotinamide and moderate
      consumption of wine significantly reduce the number of premalignant keratoses and
      SCC. Regarding lifestyle factors, both alcohol and smoking are associated with
      the development of SCC in a dose-dependent manner. Relevant environmental factors
      are viral infections and chemical contaminants. Human papillomavirus infections
      induce deregulation of cellular proliferation and are associated with AK, BD and 
      SCC. In addition to outdoor jobs, occupations such as industrial processing and
      farming also increase the risk of developing keratoses and SCC. The exposome of
      AK will undoubtedly help the understanding of its etiopathology and possible
      progression to SCC and will serve as a basis to design tailored prevention
      strategies.

AB  - Introduction: This study investigated the eggs of Polish-bred edible snails of
      the Cornu genus as a food and aimed to determine the presence of microorganisms
      in them of the Salmonella and Listeria genera and ascertain the number of
      coagulase-positive staphylococci. Material and Methods: Raw material,
      semi-finished products, and the final product were collected during the
      production cycle. Testing for the presence of Salmonella spp. and Listeria spp.
      and measuring of the pathogenic staphylococci contamination level were carried
      out in accordance with ISO standards. Commercial biochemical tests were used for 
      species identification of bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family and
      Staphylococcus genus. An API kit and a PCR protocol were utilised for species
      confirmation of the microorganisms of the Listeria genus. Results: Neither
      Salmonella nor coagulase-positive staphylococci were found in any of the studied 
      material. Bacteria of the Listeria genus were found in samples taken at every
      stage of production; however L. monocytogenes was confirmed in samples of the
      final product. Conclusion: The absence of Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus
      aureus in samples of the final product indicates that the required hygiene
      standard was maintained in the production process of edible snail eggs.
      Nevertheless, the presence of L. monocytogenes in eggs of common garden snails
      may pose a potential risk to consumer health.

TI  - Chitosan nanofiber biocomposites for potential wound healing applications:
      Antioxidant activity with synergic antibacterial effect.
PG  - e10254
LID - 10.1002/btm2.10254 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial wound infection is one of the most common nosocomial infections. The
      unnecessary employment of antibiotics led to raising the growth of
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Accordingly, alternative armaments capable of
      accelerating wound healing along with bactericidal effects are urgently needed.
      Considering this, we fabricated chitosan (CS)/polyethylene oxide (PEO) nanofibers
      armed with antibacterial silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles. The nanocomposites 
      exhibited a high antioxidant effect and antibacterial activity against
      Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Besides,
      based on the results of the cell viability assays, the optimum concentration of
      ZnONPs and AgNPs in the nanofibrous mats is 0.2% w/v and 0.08% w/v respectively
      and had no cytotoxicity on fibroblast cells. The scaffold also showed good blood 
      compatibility according to the effects of coagulation time. As well as
      significant fibroblast migration and proliferation on the wound margin, according
      to wound-healing assay. All in all, the developed biocompatible, antioxidant, and
      antibacterial Ag-ZnO NPs incorporated CS/PEO nanofibrous mats showed their
      potential as an effective wound dressing.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Cefazolin in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of Critically 
      Ill Patients.
PG  - ofab649
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofab649 [doi]
AB  - Background: The relative distribution of cefazolin into the cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) remains debated. Determining the distribution of cefazolin into the CSF in 
      noninfected adults may allow for further treatment applications of cefazolin.
      This prospective pharmacokinetic study aimed to determine the pharmacokinetic
      parameters of cefazolin in serum and CSF from external ventricular drains (EVDs) 
      in neurologically injured adults. Methods: Blood and CSF were collected, using a 
      biologic waste protocol, for cefazolin quantification and trapezoidal rule-based 
      pharmacokinetic analysis in a total of 15 critically ill adults receiving 2000 mg
      intravenously every 8 hours or the renal dose equivalent for EVD prophylaxis.
      Results: A median (range) of 3 (2-4) blood and 3 (2-5) CSF samples were collected
      for each patient. The most common admitting diagnosis was subarachnoid hemorrhage
      (66.7%). The median calculated cefazolin CSF Cmax and Cmin values (interquartile 
      range [IQR]) were 2.97 (1.76-8.56) mg/L and 1.59 (0.77-2.17) mg/L, respectively. 
      The median (IQR) CSF to serum area under the curve ratio was 6.7% (3.7%-10.6%),
      with time-matched estimates providing a similar estimate (8.4%). Of those
      receiving cefazolin every 8 hours, the median and minimum directly measured CSF
      cefazolin concentration >/=4 hours following administration were 1.87 and 0.78
      mg/L, respectively. Conclusions: Cefazolin dosed for EVD prophylaxis achieved CSF
      concentrations suggesting viability as a therapeutic option for patients with
      meningitis or ventriculitis due to susceptible bacteria such as
      methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Further clinical trials are
      required to confirm a role in therapy for cefazolin. Population-based
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling may suggest an optimal cefazolin regimen
      for the treatment of central nervous system infections.

TI  - Micrococcal Nuclease stimulates Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm Formation in a
      Murine Implant Infection Model.
PG  - 799845
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2021.799845 [doi]
AB  - Advancements in contemporary medicine have led to an increasing life expectancy
      which has broadened the application of biomaterial implants. As each implant
      procedure has an innate risk of infection, the number of biomaterial-associated
      infections keeps rising. Staphylococcus aureus causes 34% of such infections and 
      is known as a potent biofilm producer. By secreting micrococcal nuclease S.
      aureus is able to escape neutrophil extracellular traps by cleaving their
      DNA-backbone. Also, micrococcal nuclease potentially limits biofilm growth and
      adhesion by cleaving extracellular DNA, an important constituent of biofilms.
      This study aimed to evaluate the impact of micrococcal nuclease on infection
      persistence and biofilm formation in a murine biomaterial-associated
      infection-model with polyvinylidene-fluoride mesh implants inoculated with
      bioluminescent S. aureus or its isogenic micrococcal nuclease deficient mutant.
      Supported by results based on in-vivo bioluminescence imaging, ex-vivo colony
      forming unit counts, and histological analysis it was found that production of
      micrococcal nuclease enables S. aureus bacteria to evade the immune response
      around an implant resulting in a persistent infection. As a novel finding,
      histological analysis provided clear indications that the production of
      micrococcal nuclease stimulates S. aureus to form biofilms, the presence of which
      extended neutrophil extracellular trap formation up to 13 days after mesh
      implantation. Since micrococcal nuclease production appeared vital for the
      persistence of S. aureus biomaterial-associated infection, targeting its
      production could be a novel strategy in preventing biomaterial-associated
      infection.

      Bacteria: An In Vitro Study.
PG  - e20808
LID - 10.7759/cureus.20808 [doi]
AB  - Background Varied treatment modalities have been described in the past for the
      management of peri-implant diseases but the evidence of the use of probiotics for
      the treatment of peri-implantitis is limited. The aim of this study was to
      determine the antagonistic growth effects of Lactobacillus salivarius on the
      growth of peri-implantitis pathogens. Material and method Anin vitroassessment of
      probiotic L. salivarius on peri-implantitis pathogens was done using the serial
      tube dilution method. Minimum inhibitory concentration was calculated for five
      subgingival pathogens namely Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter
      actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus salivarius, and
      Staphylococcus aureus. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is defined as the
      lowermost concentration of any drug that prevents the noticeable growth of the
      test organism. In vitro assessment to determine the MIC is necessary for an in
      vivo application. The MIC value will also help to find the drug's accurate
      dosage. Results Peri-implantitis pathogens were cultured from individuals
      diagnosed with peri-implantitis. Except for A. actinomycetemcomitans, all other
      pathogens were susceptible to the probiotic. S. salivarius had the lowest MIC
      (0.8mg/mL). Conclusion The MIC value for pathogens will help to determine the
      effective mode and form of probiotic that can be used for the treatment of
      peri-implantitis.

TI  - Treatment of Impetigo with Antiseptics-Replacing Antibiotics (TIARA) trial: a
      single blind randomised controlled trial in school health clinics within
      socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in New Zealand.
PG  - 108
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06042-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a common and contagious bacterial skin infection,
      affecting children worldwide, but it is particularly prevalent in
      socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. In New Zealand, widespread
      prescribing of the topical antibiotic fusidic acid had led to an increase in
      antimicrobial resistance of Staphylococcus aureus. Alternative treatments are
      urgently being sought, and as impetigo is a superficial infection, it has been
      suggested that topical antiseptics such as hydrogen peroxide or simple wound care
      alone may treat impetigo while avoiding the risk of increased antimicrobial
      resistance. METHODS: This protocol for a non-inferiority, single-blind randomised
      controlled trial compares topical fusidic acid with topical hydrogen peroxide and
      with simple wound care in the treatment of childhood impetigo. Participants are
      randomised to one of the three treatments for 5 days. The primary outcome is
      clinical improvement assessed through paired photographs analysed by graders
      blinded to treatment arm. The trial is based in school health clinics in an urban
      centre in New Zealand. Comparison of antimicrobial resistance patterns pre- and
      post-treatment is also performed. DISCUSSION: Special note is made of the need to
      involve the communities most affected by impetigo in the design and
      implementation of the clinical trial to recruit the children most in need of safe
      and effective treatments. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus and Neutrophil Extracellular Traps: The Master Manipulator 
      Meets Its Match in Immunothrombosis.
PG  - ATVBAHA121316930
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.316930 [doi]
AB  - Over the past 10 years, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have become widely 
      accepted as an integral player in immunothrombosis, due to their complex
      interplay with both pathogens and components of the coagulation system. While the
      release of NETs is an attempt by neutrophils to trap pathogens and constrain
      infections, NETs can have bystander effects on the host by inducing uncontrolled 
      thrombosis, inflammation, and tissue damage. From an evolutionary perspective,
      pathogens have adapted to bypass the host innate immune response. Staphylococcus 
      aureus (S. aureus), in particular, proficiently overcomes NET formation using
      several virulence factors. Here we review mechanisms of NET formation and how
      these are intertwined with platelet activation, the release of endothelial von
      Willebrand factor, and the activation of the coagulation system. We discuss the
      unique ability of S. aureus to modulate NET formation and alter released NETs,
      which helps S. aureus to escape from the host's defense mechanisms. We then
      discuss how platelets and the coagulation system could play a role in NET
      formation in S. aureus-induced infective endocarditis, and we explain how
      targeting these complex cellular interactions could reveal novel therapies to
      treat this disease and other immunothrombotic disorders.

TI  - Microbiological identification and resistance profile of microorganisms in
      pressure injuries after the use of polyhexamethylene biguanide: a series of
      fourteen cases.
PG  - 51-56
LID - 10.25270/wnds/2022.5156 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Colonization of a pressure injury with microorganisms can
      negatively affect wound healing. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate which products
      best facilitate wound healing. OBJECTIVE: This case series evaluated the
      effectiveness of the antimicrobial polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) on
      microorganisms in pressure injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients (14
      wounds) were treated with PHMB in the hospital setting after collection of a
      wound swab sample for microbiological analysis and determination of the risk
      profile using the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Thirteen lesions (92.9%) were
      positive for 1 or more bacterial strains, the most prevalent of which were
      Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Two strains of
      methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) were also identified. Klebsiella pneumoniae
      demonstrated 100% resistance to the tested antibiotics, with Acinetobacter
      demonstrating 90% resistance, P aeruginosa 88.9%, Citrobacter freundii 87.5%, S
      aureus 66.7%, and MRSA 57.1%. Only Serratia marcescens demonstrated no resistance
      to any antibiotic tested. Polyhexamethylene biguanide was effective only against 
      strains of S marcescens, which were not present in the second wound swab sample
      collected (after the application of PHMB); other microorganisms were present in
      the second wound swab sample collected. CONCLUSIONS: Polyhexamethylene biguanide 
      has an immediate antimicrobial effect on S marcescens. However, it had no
      qualitative effect on the other microorganisms. Studies with larger populations
      and randomized clinical trial methodologies are necessary to elucidate additional
      findings concerning the effectiveness of PHMB in managing microorganisms in
      pressure injuries.

TI  - Gemini-Mediated Self-Disinfecting Surfaces to Address the Contact Transmission of
      Infectious Diseases.
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c03401 [doi]
AB  - According to both the Center for Disease Control and the World Health
      Organization, contact transmission is the primary transmission route of
      infectious diseases worldwide. Usually, this is mitigated by a schedule of
      repeated regular sanitization, yet surfaces are easily re-contaminated in the
      interim between cleanings. One solution to this problem is to generate
      self-disinfecting surfaces that can display sustained virucidal/antimicrobial
      properties against pathogens that settle upon them. Quaternary ammonium
      organosilicon compounds are ideal candidates to achieve this; cationic
      surfactants are safe and well-established surface disinfectants, while
      organosilanes are used broadly to form durable coatings with altered surface
      properties on many different materials. Despite their potential to circumvent the
      disadvantages of traditional disinfection methods, extant commercially available 
      quaternary ammonium silanes do not display comparable efficacy to the standard
      surface disinfectants, nor have their respective coatings been demonstrated to
      meet the Environmental Protection Agency's guidelines for residual/extended
      efficacy. Inspired by the powerful surface activity of double-headed "gemini"
      surfactants, here, we present gemini-diquaternary silanes (GQs) with robust
      residual germicidal efficacy on various surfaces by incorporating a second
      cationic "head" to the structure of a conventional monoquaternary ammonium silane
      (MQ). Aqueous solutions of GQs were tested in suspension- and
      surface-antimicrobial assays against an array of pathogens, including
      Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). GQ performance was benchmarked
      against the common disinfectants, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorite, as
      well as MQ. Solutions of GQs were efficacious when used for immediate
      disinfection (>10(6)-fold reduction in 15 s). Additionally, GQs were demonstrated
      to impart durable self-disinfecting properties to a variety of porous and
      nonporous surfaces, effective after repeated cycles of abrasion and repeated
      contaminations, and with superior coating ability and activity (>10(8) higher
      activity) than that of MQs. GQs as surface treatments show great promise to
      overcome the limitations of traditional disinfectants in preventing the spread of
      infectious diseases.

TI  - Toward accurate diagnosis and surveillance of bacterial infections using enhanced
      strain-level metagenomic next-generation sequencing of infected body fluids.
LID - bbac004 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbac004 [doi]
AB  - Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) enables comprehensive pathogen
      detection and has become increasingly popular in clinical diagnosis. The distinct
      pathogenic traits between strains require mNGS to achieve a strain-level
      resolution, but an equivocal concept of 'strain' as well as the low pathogen
      loads in most clinical specimens hinders such strain awareness. Here we introduce
      a metagenomic intra-species typing (MIST) tool
      (https://github.com/pandafengye/MIST), which hierarchically organizes reference
      genomes based on average nucleotide identity (ANI) and performs maximum
      likelihood estimation to infer the strain-level compositional abundance. In
      silico analysis using synthetic datasets showed that MIST accurately predicted
      the strain composition at a 99.9% average nucleotide identity (ANI) resolution
      with a merely 0.001x sequencing depth. When applying MIST on 359 culture-positive
      and 359 culture-negative real-world specimens of infected body fluids, we found
      the presence of multiple-strain reached considerable frequencies (30.39%-93.22%),
      which were otherwise underestimated by current diagnostic techniques due to their
      limited resolution. Several high-risk clones were identified to be prevalent
      across samples, including Acinetobacter baumannii sequence type (ST)208/ST195,
      Staphylococcus aureus ST22/ST398 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ST11/ST15, indicating 
      potential outbreak events occurring in the clinical settings. Interestingly,
      contaminations caused by the engineered Escherichia coli strain K-12 and BL21
      throughout the mNGS datasets were also identified by MIST instead of the
      statistical decontamination approach. Our study systemically characterized the
      infected body fluids at the strain level for the first time. Extension of mNGS
      testing to the strain level can greatly benefit clinical diagnosis of bacterial
      infections, including the identification of multi-strain infection,
      decontamination and infection control surveillance.

TI  - Green synthesis of fluorescent carbon dots with antibacterial activity and their 
      application in Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) storage.
LID - 10.1039/d1fo03426j [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial materials prepared from natural products could provide new ways to 
      preserve seafood and extend the shelf life. Herein, four kinds of fluorescent
      carbon dots were prepared using onion, ginger, garlic, and fish through one-step 
      hydrothermal synthesis. The four prepared carbon dots were nearly spherical and
      nanosized, with amorphous structure, neutral charge and good water
      dispersibility. The onion and garlic carbon dots contained more sulfur elements
      than the ginger and fish carbon dots. Interestingly, the onion carbon dots
      exhibited the best antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas fragi with good
      stability over a wide pH range. In addition, the onion carbon dots also exhibited
      antimicrobial activity against representative Gram-negative (Escherichia coli)
      and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. The minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) and the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of onion
      carbon dots against Pseudomonas fragi were 2 mg mL(-1) and 4 mg mL(-1),
      respectively. The integrity of the cell wall and the cell membrane were damaged
      for Pseudomonas fragi, and the extracellular alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and ATP
      activity also increased after exposure to the onion carbon dots, thus leading to 
      a decrease in the cell viability and alteration of the cellular morphology for
      Pseudomonas fragi. Furthermore, the preservation effect of onion carbon dots on
      Atlantic mackerel evaluated by storage at 4 degrees C revealed that the onion
      carbon dots significantly reduced drip loss, total volatile basic nitrogen
      (TVB-N) value and total viable counts (TVC) value, and extended the shelf life of
      Atlantic mackerel by 2 days. This finding suggests that onion carbon dots have
      potential to be applied as a bacteriostatic agent for aquatic products.

AB  - This study aims to design a 3D carbonate-hydroxyapatite (CHA)/sago (S) based egg 
      white (EW) microstructure with antibacterial properties to improve the
      performance of bone grafts for bone tissue engineering. In this study, Pinctada
      maxima (P. maxima) shell was used as a calcium (Ca) source in CHA synthesis. The 
      annealing temperature of CHA at 900, 1000, and 1100 degrees C affected
      microstructural and lattice parameters, with stoichiometry 1.72-1.77, and B-type 
      CHA was identified. CHA/S with various concentrations of EW (10 and 30 wt.%)
      effectively increased pore size and porosity. XRD spectra confirmed that sago and
      EW in CHA nanocomposite stable the crystal structure. FTIR spectrum shows protein
      phosphorylation in CHA nanocomposite due to PO4(3-) ion exchange. In-vitro
      bioactivity of CHA-S10 (MTT assay) showed increased cell viability and optical
      density (OD; 24-48 h) to control. Antibacterial activity of CHA-S10 and CHA/S
      (control) against bacteria associated with periodontal disease and bone infection
      (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans [A. actinomycetemcomitans], Porphyromonas
      gingivalis [P. gingivalis], Fusobacterium nucleatum [F. nucleatum; gram
      negative], and Staphylococcus aureus [S. aureus; gram positive]) by disc
      diffusion method showed that CHA-S10 and CHA/S had strong antibacterial activity.
      In conclusion, EW's properties had proven the CHA/S/EW as bone grafts,
      effectively increasing pore size, porosity, biocompatibility, and strong
      antibacterial properties.

TI  - The Anticancer Agent 3,3'-Diindolylmethane Inhibits Multispecies Biofilm
      Formation by Acne-Causing Bacteria and Candida albicans.
PG  - e0205621
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.02056-21 [doi]
AB  - The Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium Cutibacterium acnes is a major inhabitant
      of human skin and has been implicated in acne vulgaris formation and in the
      formation of multispecies biofilms with other skin-inhabiting organisms like
      Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Indoles are widespread in nature
      (even in human skin) and function as important signaling molecules in diverse
      prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In the present study, we investigated the
      antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of 20 indoles against C. acnes. Of the
      indoles tested, indole-3-carbinol at 0.1 mM significantly inhibited biofilm
      formation by C. acnes without affecting planktonic cell growth, and the
      anticancer drug 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) at 0.1 mM (32 mug/mL) also
      significantly inhibited planktonic cell growth and biofilm formation by C. acnes,
      whereas the other indoles and indole itself were less effective. Also, DIM at 0.1
      mM successfully inhibited multispecies biofilm formation by C. acnes, S. aureus, 
      and C. albicans. Transcriptional analyses showed that DIM inhibited the
      expressions of several biofilm-related genes in C. acnes, and at 0.05 mM, DIM
      inhibited hyphal formation and cell aggregation by C. albicans. These results
      suggest that DIM and other indoles inhibit biofilm formation by C. acnes and have
      potential use for treating C. acnes associated diseases. IMPORTANCE Since indoles
      are widespread in nature (even in human skin), we hypothesized that indole and
      its derivatives might control biofilm formation of acne-causing bacteria
      (Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus) and fungal Candida albicans. The 
      present study reports for the first time the antibiofilm and antimicrobial
      activities of several indoles on C. acnes. Of the indoles tested, two anticancer 
      agents, indole-3-carbinol and 3,3'-diindolylmethane found in cruciferous
      vegetables, significantly inhibited biofilm formation by C. acnes. Furthermore,
      the most active 3,3'-diindolylmethane successfully inhibited multispecies biofilm
      formation by C. acnes, S. aureus, and C. albicans. Transcriptional analyses
      showed that 3,3'-diindolylmethane inhibited the expressions of several
      biofilm-related genes including lipase, hyaluronate lyase, and virulence-related 
      genes in C. acnes, and 3,3'-diindolylmethane inhibited hyphal formation and cell 
      aggregation by C. albicans. Our findings show that 3,3'-diindolylmethane offers a
      potential means of controlling acne vulgaris and multispecies biofilm-associated 
      infections due to its antibiofilm and antibiotic properties.

TI  - Multiplex digital PCR with digital melting curve analysis on a self-partitioning 
      SlipChip.
LID - 10.1039/d1an01916c [doi]
AB  - Digital polymerase chain reaction (digital PCR) can provide absolute
      quantification of target nucleic acids with high sensitivity, excellent
      precision, and superior resolution. Digital PCR has broad applications in both
      life science research and clinical molecular diagnostics. However, limited by
      current fluorescence imaging methods, parallel quantification of multiple target 
      molecules in a single digital PCR remains challenging. Here, we present a
      multiplex digital PCR method using digital melting curve analysis (digital MCA)
      with a SlipChip microfluidic system. The self-partitioning SlipChip (sp-SlipChip)
      can generate an array of nanoliter microdroplets with trackable physical
      positions using a simple loading-and-slipping operation. A fluorescence imaging
      adaptor and an in situ thermal cycler can be used to perform digital PCR and
      digital MCA on the sp-SlipChip. The unique signature melting temperature (Tm)
      designed for amplification products can be used as a fingerprint to further
      classify the positive amplification partitions into different subgroups.
      Amplicons with Tm differences as low as 1.5 degrees celsius were clearly
      separated, and multiple amplicons in the same partition could also be
      distinguished by digital MCA. We further demonstrated this digital MCA method
      with simultaneous digital quantification of five common respiratory pathogens,
      including Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Streptococcus
      pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Since digital MCA
      only requires an intercalation dye instead of sequence-specific hydrolysis probes
      to perform multiplex digital PCR analysis, it can be less expensive and not
      limited to the number of fluorescence channels.

LID - 10.22203/eCM.v043a03 [doi]
AB  - Orthopaedic surgical site infections, especially when a hardware is involved, are
      associated with biofilm formation. Clinical strategies for biofilm eradication
      still fall short. The present study used a novel animal model of long-bone
      fixation with vancomycin- or gentamicin-controlled release and measured the
      levels of antibiotic achieved at the site of release and in the surrounding
      tissue. Then, using fluids that contain serum proteins (synovial fluid or diluted
      serum), the levels of vancomycin or gentamicin required to substantially reduce
      colonising bacteria were measured in a model representative of either prophylaxis
      or established biofilms. In the in vivo model, while the levels immediately
      adjacent to the antibiotic release system were up to 50x the minimal inhibitory
      concentration in the first 24 h, they rapidly dropped. At peripheral sites,
      values never reached these levels. In the in vitro experiments, Staphylococcus
      aureus biofilms formed in serum or in synovial fluid showed a 5-10 fold increase 
      in antibiotic tolerance. Importantly, concentrations required were much higher
      than those achieved in the local delivery systems. Finally, the study determined 
      that the staged addition of vancomycin and gentamicin was not more efficacious
      than simultaneous vancomycin and gentamicin administration when using planktonic 
      bacteria. On the other hand, for biofilms, the staged addition seemed more
      efficacious than adding the antibiotics simultaneously. Overall, data showed that
      the antibiotics' concentrations near the implant in the animal model fall short
      of the concentrations required to eradicate biofilms formed in either synovial
      fluid or serum.

TI  - Patients With Serious Injection Drug Use-Related Infections who Experience
      Patient-Directed Discharges on Oral Antibiotics Have High Rates of Antibiotic
      Adherence but Require Multidisciplinary Outpatient Support for Retention in Care.
PG  - ofab633
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofab633 [doi]
AB  - Background: Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are frequently admitted for serious
      injection-related infections (SIRIs). Outcomes and adherence to oral antibiotics 
      for PWID with patient-directed discharge (PDD) remain understudied. Methods: We
      conducted a prospective multicenter bundled quality improvement project of PWID
      with SIRI at 3 hospitals in Missouri. All PWID with SIRI were offered
      multidisciplinary care while inpatient, including the option of addiction
      medicine consultation and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). All
      patients were offered oral antibiotics in the event of a PDD either at discharge 
      or immediately after discharge through an infectious diseases telemedicine
      clinic. Additional support services included health coaches, a therapist, a case 
      manager, free clinic follow-up, and medications in an outpatient bridge program. 
      Patient demographics, comorbidities, 90-day readmissions, and substance use
      disorder clinic follow-up were compared between PWID with PDD on oral antibiotics
      and those who completed intravenous (IV) antibiotics using an as-treated
      approach. Results: Of 166 PWID with SIRI, 61 completed IV antibiotics inpatient
      (37%), while 105 had a PDD on oral antibiotics (63%). There was no significant
      difference in 90-day readmission rates between groups (P = .819). For PWID with a
      PDD on oral antibiotics, 7.6% had documented nonadherence to antibiotics, 67% had
      documented adherence, and 23% were lost to follow-up. Factors protective against 
      readmission included antibiotic and MOUD adherence, engagement with support team,
      and clinic follow-up. Conclusions: PWID with SIRI who experience a PDD should be 
      provided with oral antibiotics. Multidisciplinary outpatient support services are
      needed for PWID with PDD on oral antibiotics.

TI  - Patients' Experiences With Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-Negative Bacterial
      Bloodstream Infections: Results From Cognitive Interviews to Inform Assessment of
      Health-Related Quality of Life.
PG  - ofab622
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofab622 [doi]
AB  - Background: We previously conducted a concept elicitation study on the impact of 
      Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacterial bloodstream infections
      (SAB/GNB) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) from the patient's
      perspective and found significant impacts on HRQoL, particularly in the physical 
      and functional domains. Using this information and following guidance on the
      development of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, we determined which
      combination of measures and items (ie, specific questions) would be most
      appropriate in a survey assessing HRQoL in bloodstream infections. Methods: We
      selected a variety of measures/items from the Patient-Reported Outcomes
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) representing different domains. We
      purposefully sampled patients ~6-12 weeks post-SAB/GNB and conducted 2 rounds of 
      cognitive interviews to refine the survey by exploring patients' understanding of
      items and answer selection as well as relevance for capturing HRQoL. Results: We 
      interviewed 17 SAB/GNB patients. Based on the first round of cognitive interviews
      (n = 10), we revised the survey. After round 2 of cognitive interviewing (n = 7),
      we finalized the survey to include 10 different PROMIS short forms/measures of
      the most salient HRQoL domains and 2 adapted questions (41 items total) that were
      found to adequately capture HRQoL. Conclusions: We developed a survey from
      well-established PRO measures that captures what matters most to SAB/GNB patients
      as they recover. This survey, uniquely tailored to bloodstream infections, can be
      used to assess these meaningful, important HRQoL outcomes in clinical trials and 
      in patient care. Engaging patients is crucial to developing treatments for
      bloodstream infections.

TI  - Brucella Peritonitis in a Patient on Peritoneal Dialysis: A Case Report and
      Review of Literature.
PG  - e20679
LID - 10.7759/cureus.20679 [doi]
AB  - Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis is the most common cause of
      morbidity, mortality, and treatment failure in patients on PD. Brucellosis is a
      worldwide zoonotic infectious disease caused by gram-negative bacteria of the
      genus Brucella. It is a major public issue in some regions. According to the
      World Health Organization report in 2011, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is
      considered endemic for brucellosis. Brucella peritonitis is one of the rarest
      presentations of Brucella. We report a case of a 14-year-old girl known to have
      end-stage renal disease, secondary to the autosomal recessive polycystic kidney. 
      She had congenital hepatic fibrosis and pancytopenia. She had been undergoing
      automated PD for the past seven years and presented with abdominal pain, seizure,
      and poor feeding. There was no history of ingestion of unpasteurized milk or
      contact with raw infected animal products. The color of PD fluid was turbid with 
      leukocytosis, predominantly neutrophils. The peritoneal fluid culture was
      positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was started
      on intraperitoneal vancomycin, which showed slow improvement. The second culture 
      of the peritoneal fluid showed Brucella species after a few days. Blood culture
      and serum serology titer for Brucella showed negative results. An anti-Brucella
      regimen, including rifampin and doxycycline, was initiated. She was treated with 
      this regimen for six weeks. After the initiation of the anti-Brucella regimen,
      she showed marked improvement. To the best of our knowledge, only a small number 
      of cases of Brucella peritonitis in PD patients have been reported. Despite the
      rarity of Brucella as a peritonitis-causing organism, it should be considered as 
      a relevant pathogen in peritonitis cases, especially in endemic regions.
      PD-associated Brucella peritonitis is rare, and PD catheter saving may be
      considered if there is a response to anti-Brucella treatment.

AB  - A series of N-heteroaryl substituted Gallamide derivatives 3a-3g were synthesised
      and the obtained structures were further confirmed by different spectral studies.
      For in-vitro antibacterial activity, the synthesised compounds were evaluated
      against three UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) bacterial strains including
      Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Furthermore,
      the designed compounds were docked with bacterial DNA gyrase and dihydropteroate 
      synthase. All the compounds had shown good inhibition against S. aureus whereas
      compound 3e has produced significant inhibition at 28 and 26 mm against S.aureus 
      and E.coli, respectively. The MIC value of the conjugate 3e and 3d was 3.12 and
      6.25 mug/mL against S. aureus andE.coli, respectively. Compound
      3,4,5-trihydroxy-N-(4-(N-(5-methyl isoxazol-3-yl) sulfamoyl) phenyl)benzamide 3d 
      had shown the highest binding energy against both the targets along with good
      antibacterial action.

AB  - As preconized by the One Health concept, the intimate relationship between pets
      and owners is a common source for the trade of microorganisms with zoonotic
      potential, and with them, antimicrobial resistance genes. In this work, we
      evaluated the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes, that are usually within
      mobile genetic elements, in a laboratory collection of 79 canine Staphylococcus
      strains, mostly Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Staphylococcus coagulans.
      Resistance to tetracycline was observed in 34% of the strains, followed by
      resistance to erythromycin (21%) and gentamicin (19%). These phenotypes were
      partially correlated with the presence of the tetracycline resistance genes
      tet(M) and tet(K) in 64% and 44% of all strains, respectively; erythromycin
      resistance genes erm(A) and erm(C) in 53% and 23%; and gentamicin resistance gene
      aac(6')-aph(2'') in 26% of the strains. At least 45% of the strains harbored
      high- and/or low-molecular weight plasmids, whose transfer may be facilitated by 
      their widespread biofilm-forming capacity, and absence of restrictive CRISPR
      systems. We selected eight plasmid-bearing and multidrug resistant strains, which
      were submitted to plasmid curing by stress with SDS. No strain lost resistance
      during stressing cultivation but, by conjugation experiments, the S.
      pseudintermedius strain 27 transferred its plasmid-borne resistance to
      gentamicin, conferred by the aac(6')-aph(2'') gene, to Staphylococcus aureus. The
      frequent empirical use of gentamicin to treat skin and ear infections in domestic
      dogs is likely to select resistant strains. Also, as demonstrated by our study,
      these strains can serve as gene reservoirs for human pathogens, such as S.
      aureus.

TI  - Antimicrobial Lignin-Based Polyurethane/Ag Composite Foams for Improving Wound
      Healing.
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.1c01465 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial materials are an urgent need for modern wound care in the clinic.
      Although traditional polyurethane foams have proven to be clinically valuable for
      wound treatment, their petroleum-originated preparation and bioinert nature have 
      restricted their efficacy in biomedical applications. Here, we propose a simple
      one-step foaming method to prepare lignin-based polyurethane foams (LPUFs) in
      which fully biobased polyether polyols partially replace traditional
      petroleum-based raw materials. The trace amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups
      (about 4 mmol) in liquefied lignin acts as a direct reducing agent and capping
      agent to silver ions (less than 0.3 mmol), in situ forming silver nanoparticles
      (Ag NPs) within the LPUF skeleton. This newly proposed lignin polyurethane/Ag
      composite foam (named as Ag NP-LPUF) shows improved mechanical, thermal, and
      antibacterial properties. It is worth mentioning that the Ag NP-LPUF exhibits
      more than 99% antibacterial rate against Escherichia coli within 1 h and
      Staphylococcus aureus within 4 h. Evaluations in mice indicate that the
      antimicrobial composite foams can effectively promote wound healing of
      full-thickness skin defects. As a proof of concept, this antibacterial and
      biodegradable foam exhibits significant potential for clinical translation in
      wound care dressings.

TI  - Phenolic compounds, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of extracts from
      aerial parts of Thymus zygis subsp. gracilis, Mentha suaveolens and Sideritis
      incana from Morocco.
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.202101018 [doi]
AB  - Thymus zygis subsp. gracilis , Mentha suaveolens and Sideritis incana (Lamiaceae 
      family) are well recognized for their medicinal, pharmaceutical and aromatic
      properties. The present study aimed to investigate for the first time the
      polyphenolic composition, the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of the
      extracts obtained from the aerial parts of these species collected from the
      Ifrane region of Morocco. The polyphenolic compounds were determined using
      high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode array and
      electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-PDA-ESI/MS). The antioxidant
      activity was investigated using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical
      scavenging, reducing power and ferrous ion chelating assays. The antibacterial
      activity was evaluated against three Gram-negative bacteria ( Escherichia coli,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium ) and three Gram-positive
      bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria
      monocytogenes ). A total of thirty-three, sixteen and thirteen polyphenolic
      compounds were positively identified and characterized in T. zygis subsp.
      gracilis , M. suaveolens and S. incana extracts, respectively. Among the
      extracts, M. suaveolens exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, followed by
      S. incana and T. zygis subsp. gracilis in both DPPH and reducing power assays;
      all extracts showed the lowest activity in the chelating assay. In addition, all 
      extracts demonstrated a bactericidal effect against Gram-positive bacteria and
      bacteriostatic effect against Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, the aerial parts
      of Moroccan T. zygis subsp. gracilis , M. suaveolens and S. incana might be
      considered as a valuable source of natural antioxidant and antibacterial agents
      with potential application in food and pharmaceutical industries.

TI  - The Q225P Mutation in SigB Promotes Membrane Vesicle Formation in Staphylococcus 
      aureus.
PG  - 81
LID - 10.1007/s00284-022-02772-1 [doi]
AB  - Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria release nano-sized lipid bilayered 
      particles, known as membrane vesicles (MVs), into external environments. Although
      MVs play a variety of roles in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis, the
      mechanisms underlying MV formation in Gram-positive microorganisms such as
      Staphylococcus aureus remain obscure. Bacterial MV production can be induced in
      response to stress conditions, and the alternative sigma factor B (SigB)
      functions as a central regulator of the stress response in Gram-positive
      bacteria. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the SigB(Q225P) substitution 
      mutation in S. aureus promotes biofilm formation. Here, we report that the
      SigB(Q225P) mutation also increases MV production in this important pathogen.
      LacZ reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the
      Q225P substitution reduces SigB binding to the promoter region of the
      thermonuclease gene (nuc), resulting in a significant reduction in Nuc
      expression. Deletion of nuc markedly enhances S. aureus MV generation, possibly
      due to the accumulation of nucleic acids. These results are not only important
      for understanding MV biogenesis in S. aureus, but also useful for the development
      of a S. aureus MV-based platform for MV application.

TI  - An innovative telemedical network to improve infectious disease management in
      critically ill patients and outpatients: a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized
      controlled trial (TELnet@NRW).
LID - 10.2196/34098 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence-based infectious disease and intensive care management is
      more relevant than ever. Medical expertise in the two disciplines is often
      geographically limited to university institutions. In addition, the
      interconnection between inpatient and outpatient care is often insufficient
      (e.g., no shared electronic health record, no digital transfer of patient
      findings). OBJECTIVE: To establish and evaluate a telemedical
      inpatient-outpatient network based on expert teleconsultations to increase
      treatment quality in intensive care medicine and infectious diseases. METHODS: We
      performed a multicentre, stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial (Feb 2017 - Jan
      2020) to establish a telemedicine inpatient-outpatient network among university
      hospitals, hospitals, and outpatient physicians in North Rhine Westphalia,
      Germany. Patients >/= 18 years of age in the intensive care unit (ICU) or
      consulting with a physician in the outpatient setting were eligible. We provided 
      expert knowledge from intensivists and infectious disease specialists through
      advanced training courses and expert teleconsultations with 24/7/365 availability
      on demand resp. once per week to enhance treatment quality. The primary outcome
      was adherence to the ten Choosing Wisely(R) recommendations for infectious
      disease management. Guideline adherence was analysed using binary logistic
      regression models. RESULTS: Overall, 159,424 patients (10,585 inpatients, 148,839
      outpatients) from 17 hospitals and 103 outpatient physicians were included. There
      was a significant increase in guideline adherence in the management of
      Staphylococcus aureus infections (OR 4.00 [95% CI 1.83, 9.20], P<.01) and in
      sepsis management in critically ill patients (OR 6.82 [95% CI 1.27, 56.61],
      P=.04). There was a statistically non-significant decrease in sepsis related
      mortality from 28.8% (19/66) in the control group to 23.8% (50/210) in the
      intervention group. Furthermore, the extension of treatment with prophylactic
      antibiotics after surgery was significantly less likely (OR 9.37 [95% CI 1.52,
      111.47], P=.04). Patients treated by outpatient physicians, who were regularly
      taking part in expert teleconsultations, were also more likely to be treated
      according to guideline recommendations regarding antibiotic therapy for
      uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections (OR 1.34 [95% CI 1.16, 1.56],
      P<.01) and asymptomatic bacteriuria (OR 9.31 [95% CI 3.79, 25.94], P<.01). For
      the other recommendations, we found no significant effects, or we had too few
      observations to generate models. Key limitations of our study include selection
      effects due to the applied on-site triage of patients as well as the limited
      possibilities to control for secular effects. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine
      facilitates a direct round-the-clock interaction over broad distances between
      intensivists or infectious disease experts and physicians who care for patients
      in hospitals without ready access to these experts. Expert teleconsultations
      increase guideline adherence and treatment quality in infectious disease and
      intensive care management creating added value for critically ill patients.

TI  - Prevalence and characterization of -methicillin-resistant Macrococcus spp. in
      food producing animals and meat in Switzerland in 2019.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Macrococcus spp. in calves 
      and pigs at slaughterhouses and in retail beef and pork meat was determined using
      samples taken in 2019 within the framework of the national monitoring of
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in food producing animals in
      Switzerland. The isolates were submitted to antimicrobial susceptibility testing 
      of 19 antibiotics and to molecular techniques (e.g. PCR, microarray, WGS) for the
      identification of resistance genes, elements containing the methicillin
      resistance genes mec and sequence type (ST). Methicillin-resistant Macrococcus
      spp. (M. caseolyticus (n=38), M. bohemicus (n=4) and Macrococcus spp. (n=2)) were
      isolated in 40 of 299 nasal swabs from calves representing a prevalence of 13,38 
      % (95 % CI, 9,98 % - 17,70 %), and in four of 303 nasal swabs from pigs [1,32 %
      (95 % CI, 0,36 % - 3,35 %)]. One of 311 samples of Swiss pork meat contained a
      Macrococcus sp. [0,32 % (95 % CI, 0,01 % - 1,78 %)], and four of 309 beef meat
      samples (260 domestic and 49 imported) contained M. caseolyticus [1,29 % (95 %
      CI, 0,35 % - 3,28 %)]. The M. caseolyticus strains belonged to diverse STs, with 
      ST21 being the most common in both pigs and calves. The mecD gene was located on 
      Macrococcus resistance island mecD (McRImecD) in 42 strains and on staphylococcal
      cassette chromosome mec (SCCmecD) in three strains, while mecB was found on
      plasmids in four strains. In addition to resistance to beta-lactams, the strains 
      also exhibited resistance to tetracycline (n=17; tet(L), tet(K), tet(M)),
      streptomycin (n=13; str, ant(6)-Ia, rpsL mutation [K56R in ribosomal protein
      S12]), kanamycin (n=10; aac(6')-Ie - aph(2'')-Ia, aph(2')-Ib, aph(2')-Ic,
      ant(4')-Ia), clindamycin (n=9; erm(B), erm(45)), erythromycin (n=9; erm(B),
      msr(G), erm(45)), fusidic acid (n=9; fusC) and gentamicin (n=1; aac(6')-Ie -
      aph(2'')-Ia). This study represents the first national prevalence study of
      methicillin-resistant Macrococcus spp. in pigs, calves, pork and beef meat in
      Switzerland and revealed a reservoir of genetically diverse strains carrying
      several resistance traits.

AB  - Up-to-date particle sieving schemes face formidable challenges for sieving
      label-free submicron molecules with similar sizes and dielectric constants but
      diverse shapes. Herein, optical sorting of polystyrene particles with various
      shapes is illustrated in optofluidic nanophotonic paired waveguide (ONPW)
      composed of chalcogenide semiconductor Sb2Se3. The Sb2Se3-ONPW creates the
      coupling length (CL) between the neighboring hot spots that can be actively
      modulated via the transition of Sb2Se3 between amorphous (AM) and crystalline
      (CR) phases. Submicron particles interfere with the coupled hotspots, which can
      exert various optical torques on the particles according to their profiles. In
      the model system, spherical (diameter of 0.5 mum) and rod-shaped (diameter of 0.5
      mum, length of 1.5 mum) polystyrene particles were employed to mimic two types of
      bacteria, namely, Staphylococcus aureus and rod-shaped Escherichia coli,
      respectively. For the AM state, the CL value is approximately 7.0 mum, enabling
      the structure to trap the sphere stably in the hot spots. For the CR state, the
      CL value becomes approximately 25 mum, leading to stable trapping of the
      rod-shaped particle. In this work, the working wavelength was fixed at 1.55 mum
      at which both AM- and CR-Sb2Se3 are transparent. Our scheme may offer a paradigm 
      shift in shape-selective sieving of biomolecules and fulfill the requirements of 
      the new-generation lab-on-chip techniques, where the integrated manipulation
      system must be much more multifunctional and flexible.

TI  - Chronic Pelvic Osteomyelitis: Case Report of a Rare Complication of Bone Marrow
      Biopsy.
PG  - e20599
LID - 10.7759/cureus.20599 [doi]
AB  - Osteomyelitis commonly involves the long bones, with pelvic involvement uncommon.
      We report the case of a 50-year-old male who, following a bone marrow biopsy that
      diagnosed him with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, had persistent complaints of fever,
      swelling, and pain over the biopsy site. Pus cultures revealed growth of
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with computed tomography and 
      magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis revealing features of osteomyelitis of
      the right ilium. He was managed conservatively with antibiotics. On the last
      follow-up, he had just recovered from another flare of the infection. Bone marrow
      biopsy is a common tool in the hematologist's inventory. It is quite safe, with
      complications reported in less than 0.1% of all cases. Osteomyelitis of the
      pelvis following this is exceedingly rare; to our knowledge, only two prior such 
      cases have been reported. Pelvic osteomyelitis is characterized by poorly defined
      hip pain, limited range of motion, and difficulty with ambulation. In case of
      intractable hip or buttock pain following a bone marrow biopsy, osteomyelitis of 
      the pelvis must be considered in the differential diagnosis, and appropriate
      management must be begun. A multidisciplinary approach is required, with surgical
      debridement and appropriate antibiotics.

PG  - e20598
LID - 10.7759/cureus.20598 [doi]
AB  - While prostatic abscesses infrequently occur in adults, they are extremely rare
      in children. We present a rare case of a prostatic abscess in a 13-year-old male 
      patient caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient
      had no significant past history and presented to our clinic reporting a two-week 
      history of lower abdominal pain, foul-smelling urethral discharge, a burning
      sensation during urination with pain in the tip of his penis, and itchiness
      around the anus. On examination, we noted lower abdominal tenderness, and on per 
      rectal examination, we noted tenderness in the anterior wall of the rectum. A
      culture from the urethral discharge was positive for MRSA. The patient was
      diagnosed with a prostatic abscess and was started on antibiotics. We performed
      ultrasound-guided transrectal drainage, and afterward, the patient's condition
      improved. He was doing well on the last follow-up. This case reminds physicians
      to consider prostatic abscesses in patients with lower urinary tract infections
      that do not respond to antibiotics.

TI  - Bacteriological Profile of Diabetic Foot Ulcers and Detection of
      Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Extended-Spectrum beta-Lactamase 
      Producers in a Tertiary Care Hospital.
PG  - e20596
LID - 10.7759/cureus.20596 [doi]
AB  - Introduction Diabetic foot infection is the most dreaded complication of diabetes
      mellitus and the commonest cause of hospitalization and limb amputation.
      Identification of the causative agent responsible for diabetic foot infection and
      the earliest initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy are vital for the
      control and prevention of the complication of diabetic foot ulcers. Therefore, we
      conducted this study to determine the bacteriological profile of diabetic foot
      ulcers and to detect methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers in our institute. Methodology
      During the study period, samples were collected from the foot ulcers of 100
      patients at the Diabetic Outpatient Department. The samples were processed
      according to the standard laboratory protocol, and bacterial isolates were
      identified. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the modified
      Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique, and results were interpreted according to
      the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (CLSI 2016). A
      phenotypic test for MRSA detection was performed using cefoxitin (30 mug) disk.
      Results The highest incidence of diabetic foot ulcers was observed in patients
      aged 41-50 years. There were 83 men and 17 women, with a male to female ratio of 
      4.882. Of the 100 collected samples, 73 were positive for microbial growth, and
      27 samples showed no growth. Of the 73 positive cultures, monomicrobial infection
      was found in 48 patients, and polymicrobial infection was found in 25 patients.
      Gram-positive pathogens were isolated from 34 patients, and gram-negative
      microbes were isolated from 64 patients. Among all collected isolates (n=100),
      Staphylococcus aureus was the most predominant organism and Acinetobacter species
      was the least common (only two isolates). Among the gram-negative bacteria,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa was predominant. All the isolated gram-positive bacteria
      were susceptible to vancomycin. Gram-negative bacteria were highly susceptible to
      colistin with the exception of Proteus species which is intrinsically resistant
      to colistin and it is not reported for Proteus species. ESBL producers were
      primarily found among Klebsiella species isolates (22.22%). Among 29 S. aureus
      isolates, 8 (27.5%) were found to be MRSA producers. Conclusion Based on the
      bacteriological profile of diabetic foot ulcers, S. aureus among the
      gram-positive isolates and P. aeruginosa among the gram-negative isolates were
      the predominant pathogens. Infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria such
      as MRSA and ESBL producers have been reported with increasing frequency.
      According to the antibiotic susceptibility pattern, treatment can be initiated,
      continued, or altered, thereby reducing morbidity in patients with diabetic foot 
      ulcers.

TI  - Infective Endocarditis Outcomes in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia.
PG  - e20556
LID - 10.7759/cureus.20556 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to analyze all the reported cases of definitive
      infective endocarditis, based on the modified Duke criteria in a tertiary
      hospital over the past five years, focusing on the causative organism/s,
      predisposing factors, and outcomes. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional
      retrospective study. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of infective
      endocarditis using modified Duke criteria were included. The demographic data,
      predisposing factors, the causative microorganisms, laboratory and
      echocardiography results, and treatment were collected. RESULTS: In total, 37
      patients were identified, 22 were male, and the median age was 59 years. Native
      valve endocarditis was found in 29 (78.3%) patients. The most frequently involved
      valves were the mitral valve in eight (42.1%) and aortic valve in six (31.6%)
      patients. Fever occurred in 22 patients (59.5%). The most frequent organisms were
      Staphylococcus aureus in 14 (37.4%) patients, coagulase-negative staphylococci in
      seven (18.9%) patients, and streptococci in seven (18.9%) patients. The majority 
      (n=27) of the patients (72.97%) were treated medically, with 10 (27.02%)
      requiring in-hospital surgical intervention. The in-hospital mortality rate was
      24.3%. Late presentation, reluctance to undergo surgery, and the past history of 
      rheumatic fever were the contributing factors. CONCLUSION: Native valve
      endocarditis is the major type of infective endocarditis. The most frequent
      organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus, and coagulase-negative
      staphylococci. In our study, infective endocarditis was more common among males, 
      surgical intervention was low, and a high in-hospital mortality rate was noted in
      our series.

AB  - Peritonitis remains the most common serious complication associated with
      peritoneal dialysis (PD). The Gram-positive peritonitis with Staphylococcus
      aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus are the most frequent causes,
      whereas Gram-positive and Gram-negative species remain less frequent. We report
      an uncommon case of PD-related peritonitis due to Streptococcus salivarius, known
      as nonpathogen Gram-positive bacteria of oral flora.

      bombarding.
PG  - 9

AB  - Fine particle bombarding (FPB) is typically utilized to modify metal surfaces by 
      bombarding them with fine particles at high-speed. The diameters of the particles
      range from several to tens of micrometers. FPB forms fine microscale concavities 
      and convexities on a surface. As FPB-treated surfaces are widely used in the food
      industry, the influence of bacteria on their surface must be considered. In this 
      study, we examined the antibacterial activity of microscale rough surfaces formed
      by FPB. We applied FPB to a stainless-steel surface and evaluated the
      antibacterial effect of FPB-treated surfaces based on JIS Z 2801 (a modified test
      method from ISO 22196:2007). Our results indicated that the FPB-treated surfaces 
      (FPB-1 (avg. pitch: 0.72 microm) and FPB-2 (avg. pitch: 3.56 microm)) exhibited
      antibacterial activity both against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - Here, an ultrasensitive and highly selective electrochemical biosensor is
      engineered by integrating bacteria-initiated click chemistry with in situ growth 
      of electroactive polymers. Leveraging the unique copper-binding redox pathway of 
      bacteria to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I), Cu(I)-catalyzed click chemistry is initiated 
      and high-density electroactive ferrocenyl polymers are subsequently generated and
      efficiently grafted on biosensing interface by potentiostatic electrochemical
      atom transfer radical polymerization that greatly enhances the sensitivity of
      electro-analytical performance. A good linearity between electrochemical signal
      and the logarithm of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli concentration
      over the range from 10(2) to 10(7) CFU/mL is obtained with detection limits down 
      to 4 and 6 CFU/mL, respectively. In order to further expand the applicability and
      universality of the sensor, bacterial magnetic separation section is supplemented
      into the system. With the help of aptamer-based magnetic preseparation section,
      selective detection of target bacteria with great anti-interference is achieved
      in complex real samples. Moreover, this biosensor can be applied in convenient
      antibiotics residue detection and rapid drug resistance analysis by merely
      substitution of recognition element or preincubation of bacteria with different
      anti-bacteria drugs. Thus, after further expansion of bacterial magnetic
      separation section or simple replacement of the originally identification
      element, a universal biosensor including bacteria analysis system and antibiotics
      detection system with excellent analytical performance is constructed. It
      provides new insight into the aspects of bacteria-related hazards detection that 
      could not only reduce the detriment caused by bacterial contamination, but also
      guide antibiotic rational usage and help to control the emergence of
      multidrug-resistant bacteria.

AB  - The unascertained, constant mutation and emergence of new types of microorganisms
      present significant challenges to their detection. Differing from the focus on
      the limited local 16S rRNA gene or protein markers, characteristic whole
      fingerprint technologies at the omic level are particularly suitable for unknown 
      analytes since accurate knowledge about the constituents is not necessarily
      required. Herein, through a combination of several innovative strategies,
      including pure water isotachophoresis integrated (2 + 1)D electrophoresis,
      inversion-funnel peak stacking channel geometry and COMSOL computer-aided fluid
      simulation, high-resolution whole protein 2D native microfluidic chip
      electrophoresis was achieved within less than 1 min. The highest ever reported
      peak capacity for native 2D chip electrophoresis was obtained. Furthermore,
      taking Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis as model
      analytes without protein biomarker information, the feasibility of the
      identification and semiqualification of unknown microbes in pure or mixed samples
      was explored with the utilisation of original algorithms, including SIFT feature 
      abstraction and a global information entropy combined support vector machine. As 
      such, the multidisciplinary cooperation in the present study demonstrates
      monstrated promising prospects for microfluidic chip electropherogram
      fingerprint-based quick microorganism assays, biointeraction studies, and drug
      screenings, even if the analytes are not fully ascertained.

TI  - Control of Staphylococcal-mediated endogenous protease activity alters wound
      closure time in a complex wound model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated protease activity is a characteristic feature of chronic
      wounds, where the inflammatory phase of wound healing is prolonged. The choice of
      dressings in treatment of chronic wounds can change the nature of the wound base 
      and have a significant impact on healing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of
      oxidised regenerated cellulose/collagen dressings on Staphylococcal-mediated
      protease activity in an inflamed wound model. METHODS: We developed an in vitro
      3D inflamed wound model, and simulated inflammation by exposing the models to
      Staphylococcal spent culture supernatant. Protease activity and wound healing
      were assessed in the presence/absence of the dressings. RESULTS: Histological
      analysis of the wound model revealed two distinct layers, an epidermal and dermal
      layer, similar to the organisation of human skin. Inflammation with
      Staphylococcal spent culture supernatant elevated protease levels by 1.7x and
      consequently prevented the wound from progressing to the proliferative phase of
      healing, without having a negative effect on cell viability. Adding a collagen
      dressing, known to have non-specific protease modulating properties, reduced
      Staphylococcal-mediated protease activity back to baseline, with a concomitant
      reduction in wound closure time. Inflamed wounds thus resembled unwounded skin
      after 10 days of treatment with the dressings. CONCLUSION: Our findings support
      the further evaluation and use of oxidised regenerated cellulose/collagen
      dressings for inflamed, non-healing wounds in the clinical setting. The model
      used in this study has the potential to be applied in preclinical research; to
      test wound dressing performance, such as healing and cell viability, and to also 
      assess key markers of inflammation.

TI  - Differences between Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage and IgE-sensitization to
      Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin on risk factors and effects in adult
      population.
PG  - 6

AB  - BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus (SA) nasal carriage (SA carriage) and
      IgE-sensitization to SA enterotoxin (SE IgE-sensitization) are known to be
      associated with chronic airway disease. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate
      the differences in risk factors, type 2 inflammation and respiratory symptoms
      between SA carriage and SE IgE-sensitization. METHODS: We conducted a
      cross-sectional study of a community-based adult population to evaluate the
      environmental exposure and health impact of the Pohang Industrial Complex, Korea.
      Participants were examined based on self-reported questionnaires, nasal swab, and
      blood sampling. RESULTS: There were 307 participants, and the overall prevalence 
      of SA carriage and SE IgE-sensitization was 26.1% (80/307) and 25.7% (79/307),
      respectively. An urban environment was significantly correlated with SA carriage,
      whereas age and obesity were significantly correlated with SE IgE-sensitization. 
      SA carriage was not associated with an increase in total IgE and blood eosinophil
      count, whereas SE IgE-sensitization was associated with an increased total IgE
      and blood eosinophil count. SA carriage was significantly correlated with cough
      persisting for more than three weeks (OR, 3.044; 95% CI, 1.137-8.153) and sputum 
      (OR, 2.429; 95% CI, 1.008-5.854). SE IgE-sensitization was a significant
      correlation with only sputum (OR, 2.452; 95% CI, 1.066-5.640). SA carriage and SE
      IgE-sensitization showed a synergistic effect on the prevalence of cough and
      sputum. CONCLUSION: SA carriage was associated with the urban environment, and SE
      IgE-sensitization was associated with the elderly and obesity. SA carriage and SE
      IgE-sensitization had different correlation with type 2 inflammation and airway
      symptoms.

AB  - Patients with uncomplicated Staphylococcus aureus primary bacteremia and
      catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) should be treated for at least 14 
      days. However, evidence for oral step-down therapy is lacking in these patients. 
      A retrospective cohort was identified from 2013 to 2018 in a 1,950-bed tertiary
      hospital. An oral antimicrobial therapy (OAT) group was defined as patients
      treated with oral antibiotics following less than 10 days of intravenous
      antimicrobial therapy (IAT). Treatment failure was defined as any case of
      recurrence or death within 90 days. A total of 103 patients were included in the 
      analysis, including 32 patients treated with OAT. Rates of treatment failure were
      3.2% and 12.7% in the OAT and IAT groups (P = 0.113). The length of hospital stay
      was shorter in the OAT group. OAT was not an independent risk factor for
      treatment failure. OAT may reduce the duration of hospitalization without adverse
      effects in these patients.

TI  - The Staphylococcus aureus CidA and LrgA Proteins Are Functional Holins Involved
      in the Transport of By-Products of Carbohydrate Metabolism.
PG  - e0282721
LID - 10.1128/mbio.02827-21 [doi]
AB  - The Staphylococcus aureus cidABC and lrgAB operons encode members of a
      well-conserved family of proteins thought to be involved in programmed cell death
      (PCD). Based on the structural similarities that CidA and LrgA share with
      bacteriophage holins, we have hypothesized that these proteins function by
      forming pores within the cytoplasmic membrane. To test this, we utilized a "lysis
      cassette" system that demonstrated the abilities of the cidA and lrgA genes to
      support bacteriophage endolysin-induced cell lysis. Typical of holins, CidA- and 
      LrgA-induced lysis was dependent on the coexpression of endolysin, consistent
      with the proposed holin-like functions of these proteins. In addition, the CidA
      and LrgA proteins were shown to localize to the surface of membrane vesicles and 
      cause leakage of small molecules, providing direct evidence of their hole-forming
      potential. Consistent with recent reports demonstrating a role for the lrgAB
      homologues in other bacterial and plant species in the transport of by-products
      of carbohydrate metabolism, we also show that lrgAB is important for S. aureus to
      utilize pyruvate during microaerobic and anaerobic growth, by promoting the
      uptake of pyruvate under these conditions. Combined, these data reveal that the
      CidA and LrgA membrane proteins possess holin-like properties that play an
      important role in the transport of small by-products of carbohydrate metabolism. 
      IMPORTANCE The Staphylococcus aureus cidABC and lrgAB operons represent the
      founding members of a large, highly conserved family of genes that span multiple 
      kingdoms of life. Despite the fact that they have been shown to be involved in
      bacterial PCD, very little is known about the molecular/biochemical functions of 
      the proteins they encode. The results presented in this study reveal that the
      cidA and lrgA genes encode proteins with bacteriophage holin-like functions,
      consistent with their roles in cell death. However, these studies also
      demonstrate that these operons are involved in the transport of small metabolic
      by-products of carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting an intriguing link between
      these two seemingly disparate processes.

TI  - Fracture-related infection in osteoporotic bone causes more severe infection and 
      further delays healing.
PG  - 49-60
LID - 10.1302/2046-3758.112.BJR-2021-0299.R1 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: With the ageing population, fragility fractures have become one of the most
      common conditions. The objective of this study was to investigate whether
      microbiological outcomes and fracture-healing in osteoporotic bone is worse than 
      normal bone with fracture-related infection (FRI). METHODS: A total of 120
      six-month-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomized to six groups: Sham, sham 
      + infection (Sham-Inf), sham with infection + antibiotics (Sham-Inf-A),
      ovariectomized (OVX), OVX + infection (OVX-Inf), and OVX + infection +
      antibiotics (OVX-Inf-A). Open femoral diaphysis fractures with Kirschner wire
      fixation were performed. Staphylococcus aureus at 4 x 10(4) colony-forming units 
      (CFU)/ml was inoculated. Rats were euthanized at four and eight weeks
      post-surgery. Radiography, micro-CT, haematoxylin-eosin, mechanical testing,
      immunohistochemistry (IHC), gram staining, agar plating, crystal violet staining,
      and scanning electron microscopy were performed. RESULTS: Agar plating analysis
      revealed a higher bacterial load in bone (p = 0.002), and gram staining showed
      higher cortical bone colonization (p = 0.039) in OVX-Inf compared to Sham-Inf.
      OVX-Inf showed significantly increased callus area (p = 0.013), but decreased
      high-density bone volume (p = 0.023) compared to Sham-Inf. IHC staining showed a 
      significantly increased expression of TNF-alpha in OVX-Inf compared to OVX (p =
      0.049). Significantly reduced bacterial load on bone (p = 0.001), enhanced
      ultimate load (p = 0.001), and energy to failure were observed in Sham-Inf-A
      compared to Sham-Inf (p = 0.028), but not in OVX-Inf-A compared to OVX-Inf.
      CONCLUSION: In osteoporotic bone with FRI, infection was more severe with more
      bone lysis and higher bacterial load, and fracture-healing was further delayed.
      Systemic antibiotics significantly reduced bacterial load and enhanced callus
      quality and strength in normal bone with FRI, but not in osteoporotic bone. Cite

TI  - n-Butanol Potentiates Subinhibitory Aminoglycosides against Bacterial Persisters 
      and Multidrug-Resistant MRSA by Rapidly Enhancing Antibiotic Uptake.
PG  - 373-386
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.1c00559 [doi]
AB  - Potentiation of traditional antibiotics is of significance for combating
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria that have become a severe threat to human and
      animal health. Here, we report that 1 min co-treatment with n-butanol greatly and
      specifically enhances the bactericidal action of aminoglycosides by 5 orders of
      magnitude against stationary-phase Staphylococcus aureus cells, with n-propanol
      and isobutanol showing less potency. This combined treatment also rapidly kills
      various S. aureus persisters, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) cells, and
      numerous Gram-positive and -negative pathogens including some clinically isolated
      multidrug-resistant pathogens (e.g., S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and
      Enterococcus faecalis) in vitro, as well as S. aureus in mice. Mechanistically,
      the potentiation results from the actions of aminoglycosides on their
      conventional target ribosome rather than the antiseptic effect of n-butanol and
      is achieved by rapidly enhancing the bacterial uptake of aminoglycosides, while
      salts and inhibitors of proton motive force (e.g., CCCP) can diminish this
      uptake. Importantly, such n-butanol-enhanced antibiotic uptake even enables
      subinhibitory concentrations of aminoglycosides to rapidly kill both MRSA and
      conventional S. aureus cells. Given n-butanol is a non-metabolite in the
      pathogens we tested, our work may open avenues to develop a
      metabolite-independent strategy for aminoglycoside potentiation to rapidly
      eliminate antibiotic-resistant/tolerant pathogens, as well as for reducing the
      toxicity associated with aminoglycoside use.

TI  - Stopping Hospital Infections with Environmental Services (SHINE): A
      Cluster-Randomized Trial of Intensive Monitoring Methods for Terminal Room
      Cleaning on Rates of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms in the Intensive Care Unit.
LID - ciac070 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac070 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) frequently contaminate hospital
      environments. We performed a multicenter, cluster-randomized, crossover trial of 
      two methods for monitoring of terminal cleaning effectiveness. METHODS: Six
      intensive care units (ICUs) at three medical centers received both interventions 
      sequentially, in randomized order. Ten surfaces were surveyed each in five rooms 
      weekly, after terminal cleaning, with ATP monitoring or an ultraviolet
      fluorescent marker (UV/F). Results were delivered to environmental services staff
      in real-time with failing surfaces recleaned. We measured monthly rates of MDRO
      infection or colonization, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
      Clostridioides difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and MDR
      gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) during a 12-month baseline period and sequential 
      6-month intervention periods, separated by a 2-month washout. Primary analysis
      compared only the randomized intervention periods, while secondary analysis
      included the baseline. RESULTS: The ATP method was associated with a reduction in
      incidence rate of MDRO infection or colonization compared to the UV/F period
      (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.876, 95% confidence-interval (CI) 0.807 - 0.951,
      P=0.002). Including the baseline period, the ATP method was associated with
      reduced infection with MDROs (IRR 0.924, 95% CI 0.855 - 0.998, P=0.04), and
      MDR-GNB infection or colonization (IRR 0.856, 95% CI 0.825 - 0.887, P<0.001). The
      UV/F intervention was not associated with a statistically significant impact on
      these outcomes. Room turn-around time increased by a median of one minute with
      the ATP intervention and 4.5 minutes with UV/F compared to baseline. CONCLUSIONS:
      Intensive monitoring of ICU terminal room cleaning with an ATP modality is
      associated with a reduction of MDRO infection and colonization.

TI  - Expression of the alpha7 nAChR Subunit Duplicate Form (CHRFAM7A) Was

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated that the effects and possible
      mechanisms of the alpha7 nAChR subunit duplicate form (CHRFAM7A) affected
      inflammation in the model of intracranial infection. METHODS: Mice of the model
      group were injected (intracranial injection) with Staphylococcus aureus. Mouse
      microglial BV2 cell was exposed with 200 ng of LPS for 4 h. RESULTS: CHRFAM7A
      mRNA expressions were reduced in patients with intracranial infection. CHRFAM7A
      mRNA and protein expressions were suppressed in mice with intracranial infection 
      in a time-dependent manner. CHRFAM7A reduced inflammation in mice with
      intracranial infection. The inhibition of CHRFAM7A reduced inflammation in mice
      with intracranial infection. CHRFAM7A suppressed p38 MAPK in mice with
      intracranial infection. The inhibition of p38 MAPK shows the effects of CHRFAM7A 
      in intracranial infection. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that the expression
      of the CHRFAM7A was down-regulated in patients with intracranial infection and
      reduced inflammation in in vitro model by p38 MAPK, which suggests the potential 
      role of CHRFAM7A as a diagnostic biomarker for intracranial infection.

TI  - Phage JS02, a putative temperate phage, a novel biofilm-degrading agent for
      Staphylococcus aureus.
LID - 10.1111/lam.13663 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a biofilm-producing organism that is frequently isolated
      from various environments worldwide. Because of the natural resistance of S.
      aureus biofilm to antibiotics, bacteriophages are considered as a promising
      alternative for its removal. The bacteriophage vB_SauS_JS02 was isolated from
      livestock wastewater and showed activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) S.
      aureus. The phage vB_SauS_JS02 exhibited broad host range and possessed a large
      burst size (52 PFU/CFU) as well as moderate pH stability (4-11) and appropriate
      thermal tolerance (40-50 masculineC). Electron microscopy and genome sequence
      revealed that vB_SauS_JS02 belonged to Triavirus genus in Siphoviridae family.
      Genetic analysis of the 46 kb sequence of vB_SauS_JS02 revealed 66 ORFs. The
      predicted protein products of the ORFs were clustered functionally into five
      groups as follows: replication/regulation, DNA packaging,
      structure/morphogenesis, lysis, and lysogeny. Although the phage vB_SauS_JS02 was
      a temperate phage, it exhibited a higher inhibiting and degrading activity
      against planktonic cells (80~90% reduction), even to S. aureus biofilm (
      approximately 68% reduction in biofilm formation). Moreover, the removal activity
      of the phage vB_SauS_JS02 against both planktonic cells and S. aureus biofilms
      was even better than that of the antibiotic (ceftazidime). In summary, the
      present study introduced the phage vB_SauS_JS02 as a potential biocontrol agent
      against biofilm-producing S. aureus after making it virulent. It may be
      applicable for phage therapy.

TI  - Influence of Socioeconomic and Environmental Determinants of Health on Human
      Infection and Colonization with Antibiotic-Resistant and Antibiotic-Associated
      Pathogens: A Scoping Review.
LID - 10.1089/sur.2021.348 [doi]
AB  - Background: Antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-associated pathogens are commonly
      encountered by surgeons. Pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA), Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), and carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) result in considerable human morbidity, mortality, and
      excess healthcare expenditure. Human colonization or infection can result from
      exposure to these pathogens across a range of domains both inside and outside of 
      the built healthcare environment, exposure that may be influenced by
      socioeconomic and environmental determinants of health, the importance of which
      has not been investigated fully. Methods: We performed a scoping review of
      published literature describing potential socioeconomic and environmental
      variables that may increase the likelihood of human infection or colonization
      with common antibiotic-resistant or antibiotic-associated pathogens, using MRSA, 
      CDI, and CRE as examples. Results: We identified 7,916 articles meeting initial
      search criteria. Of these, 101 provided supportive evidence of socioeconomic and 
      environmental determinants of human infection or colonization and were included
      in the scoping review after abstract and full-text screening. Sixty-seven
      evaluated MRSA, nine evaluated CRE, and 29 evaluated CDI. Twenty-nine articles
      evaluated exposure to livestock or companion animals; 28, exposure to
      antibiotics; 20, impact of socioeconomic factors, education level, or race; 14,
      the influence of temperature, humidity, or season; 13, the effect of travel or
      human population migration; 11, exposure to built healthcare environments; and
      eight assessed impact of population density or urbanization. Conclusions:
      Although articles outlining socioeconomic and environmental drivers of
      antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-associated infection are still disconcertedly
      few, evidence of such associations are overwhelming for MRSA and CDI and
      supportive for CRE. Additional research is needed to investigate the role and
      importance of different potential socioeconomic and environmental drivers of
      antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-associated infections and colonization in
      humans.

TI  - Evaluation of the Efficacy of Vancomycin-Soaked Autograft to Eliminate
      Staphylococcus aureus Contamination After Anterior Cruciate Ligament
      Reconstruction: Based on an Infected Rat Model.
PG  - 3635465211068114
LID - 10.1177/03635465211068114 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-soaked autograft application in anterior cruciate ligament
      reconstruction (ACLR) significantly reduces postoperative infection rates.
      However, the optimal vancomycin concentrations and time of vancomycin presoaking 
      of autografts for preventing infection are still unknown. PURPOSE: To evaluate
      the efficacy of vancomycin-soaked autografts in preventing infection in rats with
      ACLR. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: A total of 102 tendons 
      of Wistar rats were harvested under sterile conditions from fresh cadaveric legs.
      Contamination with 2.0 x 10(4) colony forming units per milliliter of
      Staphylococcus aureus and soaking in different vancomycin concentrations for
      different soaking times was performed in vitro. In vivo, after being contaminated
      with S. aureus and soaked with optimal vancomycin solution treatment and sterile 
      saline, the grafts were implanted in rat knees to finish ACLR surgery. At 2, 4,
      and 12 weeks after surgery, samples were harvested to observe signs of infection 
      and tendon-bone incorporation via general postoperative conditions, serum
      inflammatory markers, microbiological counting, knee radiographs, micro-computed 
      tomography, histologic staining, scanning electron microscopy, and biomechanical 
      testing. RESULTS: Bacterial contamination was eliminated when at least 5 or 10
      mg/mL of vancomycin was applied for 30 minutes in vitro. Rats in the
      vancomycin-soaked graft group (5 mg/mL of vancomycin for 30 minutes) showed no
      significant signs of infection and fewer positive cultures than did those without
      presoaking. The vancomycin-soaked graft group had reduced serum inflammatory
      markers, tissue scores, inflammatory reactions in the joint tissue, and
      radiographic evidence of periarticular osseous destruction compared with the
      control group. At postoperative week 12, the vancomycin-soaked graft group showed
      good outcomes in tendon-bone incorporation via micro-computed tomography,
      histologic staining, and biomechanical testing. CONCLUSION: In a rat model of
      infection after ACLR, presoaking grafts in a 5-mg/mL vancomycin solution for 30
      minutes could effectively prevent S. aureus contamination without affecting
      tendon-bone incorporation and knee function. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The present
      study could provide a specific solution for the use of vancomycin in the
      prevention of infection after ACLR clinically.

TI  - The Unfulfilled Promise of Inhaled Therapy in Ventilator-Associated Infections:
      Where Do We Go from Here?
LID - 10.1089/jamp.2021.0023 [doi]
AB  - Respiratory infection is common in intubated/tracheotomized patients and systemic
      antibiotic therapy is often unrewarding. In 1967, the difficulty in treating
      Gram-negative respiratory infections led to the use of inhaled gentamicin,
      targeting therapy directly to the lungs. Fifty-three years later, the effects of 
      topical therapy in the intubated patient remain undefined. Clinical failures with
      intravenous antibiotics persist and instrumented patients are now infected by
      many more multidrug-resistant Gram-negative species as well as
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Multiple systematic reviews and
      meta-analyses suggest that there may be a role for inhaled delivery but "more
      research is needed." Yet there is still no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      approved inhaled antibiotic for the treatment of ventilator-associated infection,
      the hallmark of which is the foreign body in the upper airway. Current pulmonary 
      and infectious disease guidelines suggest using aerosols only in the setting of
      Gram-negative infections that are resistant to all systemic antibiotics or not to
      use them at all. Recently two seemingly well-designed large randomized
      placebo-controlled Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials of adjunctive inhaled
      therapy for the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia failed to show more 
      rapid resolution of pneumonia symptoms or effect on mortality. Despite evolving
      technology of delivery devices and more detailed understanding of the factors
      affecting delivery, treatment effects were no better than placebo. What is wrong 
      with our approach to ventilator- associated infection? Is there a message from
      the large meta-analyses and these two large recent multisite trials? This review 
      will suggest why current therapies are unpredictable and have not fulfilled the
      promise of better outcomes. Data suggest that future studies of inhaled therapy, 
      in the milieu of worsening bacterial resistance, require new approaches with
      completely different indications and endpoints to determine whether inhaled
      therapy indeed has an important role in the treatment of ventilated patients.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter sp. inhibit osseointegration of
      orthopaedic implants.
PG  - iai0066921
LID - 10.1128/iai.00669-21 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial infections routinely cause inflammation and thereby impair
      osseointegration of orthopaedic implants. Acinetobacter spp., which causes
      osteomyelitis following trauma, on or off the battlefield, was however reported
      to cause neither osteomyelitis nor osteolysis in rodents. We therefore compared
      the effects of Acinetobacter strain M2 to those of Staphylococcus aureus in a
      murine implant infection model. Sterile implants and implants with adherent
      bacteria were inserted in the femur of mice. Bacterial burden, levels of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, and osseointegration were measured. All infections
      were localized to the implant site. Infection with either S. aureus or
      Acinetobacter strain M2 increased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
      the chemokine CCL2 in the surrounding femurs, inhibited bone formation around the
      implant, and caused loss of the surrounding cortical bone leading to decreases in
      both histomorphometric and biomechanical measures of osseointegration. Genetic
      deletion of TLR2 and TLR4 from the mice partially reduced the effects of
      Acinetobacter strain M2 on osseointegration but did not alter the effects of S.
      aureus. This is the first report that Acinetobacter spp. impair osseointegration 
      of orthopaedic implants in mice and the murine model developed for this study
      will be useful for future efforts to clarify the mechanism of implant failure due
      to Acinetobacter spp. and to assess novel diagnostic tools or therapeutic agents.

TI  - Genomic analyses of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from yaks in Ganzi Tibetan
      Autonomous Prefecture, China.
LID - dkac011 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jac/dkac011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the transmission and origination of MRSA in livestock 
      with limited antimicrobial use. Yak (Bos grunniens) herds in Ganzi Tibetan
      Autonomous Prefecture, China were chosen for sampling. METHODS: The yaks from all
      18 districts of Ganzi were sampled (anal swabs, n = 657; nasal swabs, n = 634).
      Based on the WGS data of 83 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, the novel structure
      of the yak S. aureus population was described. Phylogenetic analyses were
      utilized for determining the origin of the MRSA lineage in yaks. RESULTS: The yak
      S. aureus population consisted of 11 STs, 6 of which were previously undescribed,
      with ST6267 being the predominant novel ST. These isolates were generally
      susceptible to most of the tested antibiotics and lacked the associated
      antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) but showed high penicillin MIC values
      (MIC90 = 32 mg/L), which were consistent with the high positivity rate for blaZ
      (61/83). The MRSA identified in yaks were all ST59 and most likely of human
      origin. The yak ST59 MRSA each carried the human immune evasion cluster (IEC)
      while lacking the ARGs that are identified in the majority of reported Chinese
      human ST59 MRSA isolates [erm(B), ant6-Ia and aph(3'')-III]. CONCLUSIONS: The yak
      herds living on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are important livestock and follow the 
      traditional free-grazing farming model. We surveyed the yak S. aureus population 
      and found that all the yak MRSA isolates belonged to the lineage that might
      originate from the prevalent community-acquired MRSA ST59 in China. From a 'One
      Health' perspective, the transmission of human MRSA to farming animals with
      limited antimicrobial exposure highlights the multiple roles of animals in the
      expansion of MRSA.

AB  - Mammea americana L. is a plant with diverse medicinal uses in the municipality of
      Certegui, Choco, Colombia. This research characterized the ethnomedicinal,
      chemical, and antibacterial activities of the bark of Mammea americana. Through
      interviews and semistructured surveys with the community, its ethnomedicinal uses
      were determined. Compounds present in the bark extract were identified and
      quantified by gas chromatography-coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and a
      qualitative analysis was performed by preliminary phytochemistry. Antibacterial
      activity and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were carried out by agar
      diffusion and dilution methods, respectively, using ethanolic and aqueous
      extracts. Ethnomedical data showed that the bark is used to treat 14 conditions, 
      the most representative being gallstones, prostate inflammation, and malaria.
      Preliminary phytochemical analyses showed the existence of several secondary
      metabolites such as tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, triterpenes and/or steroids, 
      quinones, and saponins. A total of 29 compounds were identified; the most
      abundant were ethyl 5-oxo-4-(p-toluidine)-2,5-dihydro-3-furancarboxylate, phenol,
      4,4',4''-ethylidynetris, nerolidol, 19-hydroxy-13-epimanoyl oxide, alpha-elemene,
      and delta-cadinene. The results showed remarkable antibacterial activity of the
      ethanolic extract (20 mg/ml) against Staphylococcus aureus (22.6 mm) and
      Escherichia coli (19.6 mm) and of the crude water extract (20 mg/ml) against
      Staphylococcus aureus (18.5 mm) and Escherichia coli (12.4 mm). The strongest MIC
      was for the ethanolic extract with values of 0.357 and 0.897 mg/ml against S.
      aureus and E. coli strains, respectively, while in the aqueous extract, S. aureus
      (3.99 mg/ml) and E. coli (4.3 mg/ml) were recorded. It is assumed that the
      compounds identified in this study could be responsible for the antibacterial
      activity of the species, as well as the relationship of the identified compounds 
      and metabolites with the ethnomedical uses given by the community, providing a
      scientific and traditional basis for its different traditional medical uses.

TI  - Loratadine inhibits Staphylococcus aureus virulence and biofilm formation.
PG  - 103731
LID - 10.1016/j.isci.2022.103731 [doi]
AB  - There are no anti-virulence and anti-biofilm treatments for Staphylococcus aureus
      infection. We found that 25 muM loratadine inhibits S. aureus biofilm formation
      under static or flow-based conditions. Testing of loratadine effects on 255
      clinical S. aureus strains with varying biofilm robustness showed inhibition of
      biofilm formation in medium and strong, but not weak, biofilm-producing strains. 
      At 25 muM, loratadine reduced pigmentation and hemolysis of the bacteria without 
      affecting growth. Loratadine (5 mg/kg) reduced mortality in S. aureus pulmonary
      infection model mice and acted synergistically with vancomycin to reduce
      pulmonary bacterial load and levels of inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar 
      lavage fluid. Loratadine analogues (side-chain carbamate moiety changed)
      inhibited biofilm formation, pigmentation, and hemolysis of S. aureus. Regarding 
      mechanism, loratadine exposure reduced RNA levels of virulence-related S. aureus 
      genes, and loratadine-induced mutations in MgrA reduced loratadine-MgrA binding. 
      Overexpression of mutated mgrA in wild-type S. aureus decreased the biofilm
      formation inhibition effect of loratadine.

TI  - Next-Generation Sequencing for Pathogen Identification in Infected Foot Ulcers.
PG  - 24730114211026933
LID - 10.1177/24730114211026933 [doi]
AB  - Background: Accurate identification of primary pathogens in foot infections
      remains challenging due to the diverse microbiome. Conventional culture may show 
      false-positive or false-negative growth, leading to ineffective postoperative
      antibiotic treatment. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been explored as an
      alternative to standard culture in orthopedic infections. NGS is highly sensitive
      and can detect an entire bacterial genome along with genes conferring antibiotic 
      resistance in a given sample. We investigated the potential use of NGS for
      accurate identification and quantification of microbes in infected diabetic foot 
      ulcer (DFU). We hypothesize that NGS will aid identification of dominant pathogen
      and provide a more complete profile of microorganisms in infected DFUs compared
      to the standard culture method. Methods: Data were prospectively collected from
      30 infected DFU patients who underwent operative treatment by a
      fellowship-trained orthopedic foot and ankle surgeon from October 2018 to
      September 2019. The average age of the patient was 60.4 years. Operative
      procedures performed were irrigation and debridement (12), toe or ray amputation 
      (13), calcanectomies (4), and below-the-knee amputation (1). Infected bone
      specimens were obtained intraoperatively and processed for standard culture and
      NGS. Concordance between the standard culture and NGS was assessed. Results: In
      29 of 30 patients, pathogens were identified by both NGS and culture, with a
      concordance rate of 70%. In standard culture, Staphylococcus aureus (58.6%) was
      the most common pathogen, followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (24.1%), 
      Corynebacterium striatum (17.2%), and Enterococcus faecalis (17.2%). In NGS,
      Finegoldia magna (44.8%) was the most common microorganism followed by S. aureus 
      (41.4%), and Anaerococcus vaginalis (24.1%). On average, NGS revealed 5.1 (range,
      1-11) pathogens in a given sample, whereas culture revealed 2.6 (range, 1-6)
      pathogens. Conclusion: NGS is an emerging molecular diagnostic method of
      microbial identification in orthopedic infection. It frequently provides
      different profiles of microorganisms along with antibiotic-resistant gene
      information compared to conventional culture in polymicrobial foot infection.
      Clinical use of NGS for management of foot and ankle infections warrants further 
      investigation. Level of Evidence: Level II, diagnostic study.

      to Upgrade Our Antiquated Approach against Bacterial Infections.
PG  - 2725-2736
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.1c05303 [doi]
AB  - A newer ciprofloxacin series containing 1,2,3-triazole conjugates of
      ciprofloxacin was designed, synthesized, and well characterized using modern
      analytical techniques by reacting diversified anilines with ciprofloxacin
      obtained from ciprofloxacin hydrochloride. The newer conjugates were evaluated
      for their antimicrobial activity against various strains, viz. Staphylococcus
      aureus (ATCC25923), Enterococcus faecalis (clinical isolate), Staphylococcus
      epidermidis (ATCC3594), Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      (ATCC27853), Salmonella typhi (clinical isolate), Salmonella typhimurium
      (clinical isolate), Acinetobacter baumannii (ATCC19606), Aeromonas hydrophila
      (ATCC7966), Plesiomonas shigelloides (ATCC14029), and Sphingo biumpaucimobilis
      (MTCC6362) in vitro. Interestingly, some of the conjugates showed superior
      antimicrobial activity as compared to the control drug ciprofloxacin. The three
      compounds 4i, 4j, and 4n showed strong activity with minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) 0.78 muM, while the compound 4g showed MIC 1.56 muM against
      S. typhi (clinical). The compound 4a showed good efficacy against S. aureus
      (ATCC25923) and S. typhi (clinical) with MIC 3.12 muM, while the compound 4b
      exhibited efficacy with MIC 3.12 muM against S. aureus (ATCC25923) and the
      control drug ciprofloxacin showed MIC 6.25 muM. Among all of the synthesized
      compounds, 4e, 4f, 4g, 4h, 4p, 4q, 4t, and 4u displayed less than 20% hemolysis, 
      while the rest of the compounds showed hemolysis in the range of 21-48%.
      Moreover, the structure of compound 4b was also established by single-crystal
      X-ray diffraction studies.

AB  - Background: The emergence of multi-drug-resistant organisms has created a lot of 
      clinical problems. Hence, there is a need to find natural alternative treatment
      to counter the multi-drug-resistant organisms. Honey has a well-established usage
      as wound dressing in ancient and traditional medicine. Objective: The objective
      of this study is to establish a baseline for the antibacterial activity of 32
      global raw natural and commercial various honey samples against 8 clinical
      isolates. Methods: Thirty-two honey samples (raw and commercial honey) collected 
      from different global countries with different floral origins were tested in
      vitro for antibacterial activity against 8 clinical isolates collected from
      patients, at private hospital from Sudan, using disk diffusion technique. The
      following 6 epsilometer tests (Etest), amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime,
      chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and tetracycline, were used against 8 clinical
      isolates for Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). Results: The following 8
      clinical isolates were identified by conventional bacteriological methods:
      Staphylococcus aureus, (S. aureus) Escherichia coli (E. coli), Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Proteus
      vulgaris (P. vulgaris), Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi), Shigella sonnei (S. sonnei),
      and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Both raw natural and
      commercial honey exhibited antibacterial properties against tested Gram-positive 
      and Gram-negative bacteria. The tested organisms showed low sensitivity to
      antibiotic Etest. Conclusion: All of the bacterial species studied were uniformly
      receptive to all raw and commercial tested honey samples; in contrast, the tested
      organisms showed low sensitivity to antibiotics. Commercial honey has the same
      antibacterial activity as the raw natural unprocessed honey against tested
      clinical isolates. Thus, honey is a successful alternative to conventional
      antibiotics as has been proved against clinical isolates.

AB  - A gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, which is widely distributed is 
      considered as a bacterial infection that commonly infects the skin and mucous
      membranes. Such infections can be the cause of death and illness. In the present 
      study by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) the
      Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and MecA genes of S. aureus which were isolated
      from skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in Baghdad, Iraq were investigated. 
      This study included 96 S. aureus isolated from SSTIs and identified by Vitek. The
      results showed that 61 (63.5%) and 48 (50%) of the isolates were positive for PVL
      and MecA genes, respectively. This work presented an effective real-time PCR
      technique for detecting PVL genes alone or in conjunction with MecA. The rt-PCR
      allows for easier reaction monitoring and eliminates the need for post-PCR
      processing, saving both resources and time. Moreover, it is ideal for diagnostic 
      applications because of its high sensitivity, simplicity, and specificity.
      Besides, the rt-PCR has an option to do all the procedures in an automated mode
      of action.

AB  - The improvement of multi-resistance properties of the bacterial pathogen has
      recently been discussed as an emerging issue. In this regard, iron oxide
      nanoparticles have attracted the researchers' attention due to their wide
      application in the realm of medicine. Iron oxide nanoparticles have a high
      specific surface area that enables them to interact with the bacterial surface
      structure and has considerable antibacterial activity. The current study aimed to
      synthesize a novel antimicrobial agent from iron oxide nanoparticles and
      determine its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) on different gram-positive
      and negative variant bacterial strains isolated and characterized from the
      infected urinary tract of Iraqi elderly patients. This study was conducted from
      September 2020 to December 2020 on 75 urine samples collected from the infected
      urinary tract of elderly patients in the ages range of 60-75 years admitted to
      Al-Yarmouk Medical Hospital, Baghdad, Iraq. Isolation of bacterial isolates was
      carried out using differential and selective media. Afterward, they were
      characterized and confirmed using different biochemical tests and VITEK 2 system,
      respectively. Magnetic nanoparticles were fabricated by co-precipitation of
      ferric ions (Fe(3+)) and ferrous ions (Fe(2+)) in presence of ammonium hydroxide 
      solution (25%). The characterization of synthesized nanoparticles was performed
      subsequently using UV-VIS spectroscopy analysis, Scanning Electron Microscope
      (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis, X-ray Diffraction
      analysis (XRD), and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX). The MIC of
      synthesized sonicated Fe3O4NP against different bacterial strains was determined 
      using the broth culture dilution method through making serial dilutions of 50,
      100, 200, 400, 500, 600, 800, 900 microg/ml from a 5mg/ml nanoparticle stock
      solution. Afterward, the lowest concentration of nanoparticles required to arrest
      the growth of bacteria was determined through the colony-forming unit of each
      treated bacteria on brain heart infusion agar. In total, 17bacterial isolates
      were identified from the infected urinary tract, five bacterial isolates (E.
      coli, Pseudomanas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and
      Micrococcus luteus). In addition, two Proteus mirabilis strains were identified
      separately and were tested against synthesized Fe3O4NP to determine the MIC. The 
      novel synthesized antibacterial agent showed excellent bioactivity, compared with
      controls (consisting of bacterial suspension without ferrous oxide
      nanoparticles), and the synthesized antibacterial agent was considered
      significantly active against all the bacterial strains at a p-value less than
      0.05. The Fe3O4NP were active against gram-negative more than gram-positive
      bacteria. The MIC of synthesized and characterized Fe3O4NP wasapplied on seven
      gram-positive and negative bacterial isolates using bacteria-Fe3O4NP complex.
      Significant effects were observed on all strains, compared with controls, and
      this complex could significantly inhibit gram-negative more than gram-positive
      bacteria.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women and causes the greatest
      number of cancer-related death among women all over the world. It approximately
      accounts for 15% of all cancer death. The human microbiota is the term applied to
      the aggregate of microbes that live in different habitats of living organisms
      'bodies, including the gut, skin, vagina, and mouth, as well as nose,
      conjunctiva, pharynx, and urethra, among others. Increasing evidence is pointing 
      to the role of the microbiome in the occurrence and development of a variety of
      cancers. Intestinal microbiome imbalance is related to the occurrence of
      gastrointestinal tumors, such as esophageal, gastric, colorectal, and gallbladder
      cancer. The present study aimed to identify the role of microbiota in the
      development of breast cancer. The women with breast cancer (n=130) in this study 
      were in the age range of 25-75 years. The study was conducted in Kirkuk city of
      Iraq from September 10, 2019, to March 15, 2020. The control group included 20
      women diagnosed with benign breast lesions in the age range 25-75 years, who
      matched the women in the patient group. Blood samples and breast tissue samples
      were taken from patients with breast cancer and benign breast lesions. Blood
      samples were examined through immunological methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA) was adopted for the detection of interleukin-19 (IL-19). Breast
      tissue samples were taken from breast cancer and benign breast lesions patients
      to isolate and identify bacteria. Based on the obtained results, only 6 out of 30
      (20%) cultured breast tissue samples from women with breast cancer showed
      bacterial growth. In total, 4 (67%) and 2(33%) of these 6 positive cultures were 
      Escherichia coli was and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively, and this relation
      was statistically significant. However, no bacterial growth was observed on the
      cultured breast tissue samples taken from women with benign breast lesions.
      Moreover, the difference between women with a positive and negative result of
      bacterial culture and stages of breast cancer was statistically non-significant. 
      It is worth mentioning that 50 % of women with breast cancer and bacterial growth
      were within the age range of 40-49 year. The present study revealed that the
      difference between women with breast cancer and those with benign breast lesions 
      was statistically highly significant according to the place of residence. In
      addition, the mean level of IL-19 among women with breast cancer was lower than
      that in women with benign breast lesions, and this relation was statistically
      highly significant.

      Complex as a Potential Source for Novel Bacteriocins, Including Cesin A and
      Estercticin A.
PG  - 801467

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria is considered a major public
      health issue necessitating the discovery of alternative antimicrobial compounds. 
      In this regard, targeted genome mining in bacteria occupying under-explored
      ecological niches has the potential to reveal such compounds, including
      bacteriocins. In this study, we determined the bacteriocin biosynthetic potential
      of the psychrophilic Clostridium estertheticum complex (CEC) through a
      combination of genome mining and phenotypic screening assays. The genome mining
      was performed in 40 CEC genomes using antiSMASH. The production of
      bacteriocin-like compounds was phenotypically validated through agar well
      (primary screening) and disk diffusion (secondary screening) assays using cell
      free supernatants (CFS) and partially purified extracts, respectively. Stability 
      of four selected CFS against proteolytic enzymes, temperature and pH was
      determined while one CFS was analyzed by HRMS and MS/MS to identify potential
      bacteriocins. Twenty novel bacteriocin biosynthetic gene clusters (BBGC), which
      were classified into eight (six lantibiotics and two sactipeptides) distinct
      groups, were discovered in 18 genomes belonging to C. estertheticum (n = 12), C. 
      tagluense (n = 3) and genomospecies2 (n = 3). Primary screening linked six BBGC
      with narrow antimicrobial activity against closely related clostridia species.
      All four preselected CFS retained activity after exposure to different
      proteolytic, temperature and pH conditions. Secondary screening linked BBGC1 and 
      BBGC7 encoding a lantibiotic and sactipeptide, respectively, with activity
      against Bacillus cereus while lantibiotic-encoding BBGC2 and BBGC3 were linked
      with activity against B. cereus, Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant),
      Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MS/MS analysis revealed that C.
      estertheticum CF004 produces cesin A, a short natural variant of nisin, and HRMS 
      indicated the production of a novel sactipeptide named estercticin A. Therefore, 
      we have shown the CEC, in particular C. estertheticum, is a source of novel and
      stable bacteriocins that have activities against clinically relevant pathogens.

AB  - The goal of this study was to quantify the variability of confocal laser scanning
      microscopy (CLSM) time-lapse images of early colonizing biofilms to aid in the
      design of future imaging experiments. To accomplish this a large imaging dataset 
      consisting of 16 independent CLSM microscopy experiments was leveraged. These
      experiments were designed to study interactions between human neutrophils and
      single cells or aggregates of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) during the
      initial stages of biofilm formation. Results suggest that in untreated control
      experiments, variability differed substantially between growth phases (i.e., lag 
      or exponential). When studying the effect of an antimicrobial treatment (in this 
      case, neutrophil challenge), regardless of the inoculation level or of growth
      phase, variability changed as a frown-shaped function of treatment efficacy
      (i.e., the reduction in biofilm surface coverage). These findings were used to
      predict the best experimental designs for future imaging studies of early
      biofilms by considering differing (i) numbers of independent experiments; (ii)
      numbers of fields of view (FOV) per experiment; and (iii) frame capture rates per
      hour. A spreadsheet capable of assessing any user-specified design is included
      that requires the expected mean log reduction and variance components from
      user-generated experimental results. The methodology outlined in this study can
      assist researchers in designing their CLSM studies of antimicrobial treatments
      with a high level of statistical confidence.

TI  - Assessment of bio-contaminants during COVID-19 outbreak from the indoor
      environment of Hail city, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

AB  - Biocontaminants are minute particles derived from different biological materials.
      Indoor biocontaminants are associated with major public health problems. In Gulf 
      countries, it is more precarious due to the harsh climatic conditions, including 
      high ambient temperatures and relative humidity. In addition, due to COVID-19
      pandemic, most of the time public is inside their home. Therefore, the aim of the
      study was to determine the load of biocontaminants in the indoor environment of
      Hail city. The results showed that most of the bacteria are gram-positive and
      higher in polymicrobial (87.1%) than monomicrobial (62.7%) association. There was
      no significant association with sample collection time and types of isolates. The
      most abundant microbes found in all samples were Staphylococcus aureus followed
      by Bacillus spp. Among Gram-negative bacterial isolates, E. coli was most common 
      in tested indoor air samples. The study will be useful to find the
      biocontaminants associated with risk factors and their impact on human health in 
      indoor environment, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results
      indicate the need to implement health care awareness programs in the region to
      improve indoor air quality.

TI  - Two high-fidelity variants: efSaCas9 and SaCas9-HF, which one is better?
LID - 10.1038/s41434-022-00319-4 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic
      Repeats/CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9) nucleases have been widely applied
      for genome engineering. Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) is compact, which can
      be packaged in AAV (adeno-associated virus) vector for in vivo gene editing.
      While, wild-type SaCas9 can induce unwanted off-target mutations and
      substantially limits the applications. So far, there are two reported SaCas9
      variants with high-fidelity, including efSaCas9 from our previous study and
      SaCas9-HF. However, it remains unknown which one possessing the better fidelity
      and higher activity. Here, we performed a parallel comparison of efSaCas9 and
      SaCas9-HF in human cells through fluorescent reporter system and target deep
      sequencing, respectively. The results demonstrated that efSaCas9 possesses higher
      cleavage activity and fidelity than SaCas9-HF at the most endogenous sites in
      human cells. Collectively, our study provides insights for the rational selection
      of suitable SaCas9 for human genome editing.

TI  - Retropharyngeal abscess caused by community-acquired MRSA USA300 clone in a
      Japanese child.
LID - 10.7883/yoken.JJID.2021.605 [doi]
AB  - We describe a domestic case of retropharyngeal abscess (RFA) in a child caused by
      a community-acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA)
      isolate that was genetically proven to be USA300 clone (ST8-SCCmec IVa-
      Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL )). USA300 generally has a PVL gene,
      epidemiologic association with severe and recurrent skin and soft tissue
      infection, and is the leading cause of RPA in the United States. A 1-year-old
      previously healthy girl visited the emergency department for fever, sore throat, 
      and refusal to move her neck. There was no recent medical exposure or history of 
      travel abroad. An enhanced computed tomography revealed bulky low-density area
      with ring enhancement on retropharyngeal space and right parapharyngeal space.
      MRSA was isolated from the pus obtained from surgical drainage, and antibiotics
      were continued for a total of 21 days. The MRSA was analyzed by whole genome
      sequencing and compared with the representative USA300 isolates. The stain was
      typed as ST8-t9829-SCCmec IVa with PVL and ACME, and the sequence was 99.8 %
      identical to USA300 isolates. The present case supports the possibility that
      USA300 is potentially spreading in the Japanese community, and raises alarm for
      the possibility of USA300 invasive infections without a clear route of infection.

TI  - Systematic skin and nasal decolonization lowers Staphylococcus infection in
      pediatric cardiac surgery.
LID - S0929-693X(22)00002-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.arcped.2022.01.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative infections occur in approximately 10% of pediatric
      cardiac surgeries, involving Staphylococcus species in most cases. Nasal
      decontamination of Staphylococcus with mupirocin has been reported to reduce
      postoperative Staphylococcus infections after cardiac surgery in adults, but the 
      effect of preoperative decontamination in children undergoing cardiac surgery has
      not been sufficiently studied to reach consensus. METHODS: We conducted a
      single-center retrospective study to evaluate the impact of systematic
      preoperative decolonization with intranasal mupirocin application and
      skin-washing with chlorhexidine soap on postoperative Staphylococcus infection in
      children undergoing cardiac surgery. Our population was divided into three groups
      according to decolonization protocol (group N: no decolonization; group T:
      targeted decolonization in Staphylococcus aureus [SA] carriers only; and group S:
      systematic decolonization). RESULTS: A total of 393 children were included
      between October 2011 and August 2015 (122 in group N, 148 in group T, and 123 in 
      group S). The Staphylococcus infection rate significantly decreased in group S
      compared to group N (0.8% vs. 7.7%; p < 0.05) and tended to decrease in group S
      compared to group T (0.8% vs. 4.7%; p = 0.06). Systematic decontamination also
      significantly reduced the rate of infections starting from the skin (including
      surgical site infections and bloodstream infections) compared to targeted
      decolonization or lack of decolonization, but had no effect on the rate of
      pulmonary infections. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that
      systematic preoperative skin and nasal decontamination, regardless of SA carriage
      status, could reduce the rate of postoperative Staphylococcus infections after
      cardiac surgery in children.

TI  - Reducing the prevalence of antecubital fossa peripheral intravenous cannulation.
PG  - S8-S14
LID - 10.12968/bjon.2022.31.2.S8 [doi]
AB  - Observational studies have found that placement of peripheral intravenous
      cannulas (PIVCs) in the antecubital fossa (ACF) is associated with increased
      risks of infection, including healthcare-associated Staphylococcus aureus
      bacteraemia (HA-SAB). Avoiding placement of the PIVC in the ACF area along with
      other preventive measures such as aseptic technique, staff education on
      documentation, standardised insertion packs and alerts for timely removal, may
      reduce the overall risk of acquiring an HA-SAB. AIM: To implement a multimodal
      awareness programme on ACF cannulas and the risk of infection, and to reduce
      PIVC-associated HA-SAB in one hospital in Australia. METHOD: The authors
      performed a baseline digital survey to identify root causes for clinical decision
      making related to PIVCs and to raise awareness of the project. The authors
      performed weekly audits and provided feedback on four key wards over 12 weeks.
      Simple linear regression was used to look at the trend of ACF cannulation rates
      over time. HA-SAB rates were calculated per 10 000 occupied bed days. FINDINGS:
      Improved insertion documentation was observed during the intervention period. The
      ACF cannulation rates decreased by 0.03% per day during the study, although this 
      did not quite reach statistical significance (P=0.06). There were no
      PIVC-associated SAB events during the intervention period. The SAB rates
      decreased by 0.02% per day over the period of the study.

TI  - Biomineralized Cascade Enzyme-Encapsulated ZIF-8 Nanoparticles Combined with
      Antisense Oligonucleotides for Drug-Resistant Bacteria Treatment.
PG  - 6453-6464
LID - 10.1021/acsami.1c23808 [doi]
AB  - The unrestrained use of antibiotics accelerates the development of drug-resistant
      bacteria and leads to an increasing threat to human health. Therefore, there is
      an urgent need to explore novel and effective strategies for the treatment of
      bacterial infections. Herein, zeolite imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8) material was 
      utilized to construct biomineralized nanomaterial (GOx&HRP@ZIF-8/ASO) by
      encapsulating biological cascade enzymes and combining with antisense
      oligonucleotides (ASOs), which achieved effective and synergistic
      antidrug-resistant bacteria therapy. Various in vitro assays confirmed that
      GOx&HRP@ZIF-8/ASO exhibited excellent antibacterial properties against
      Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)
      during catalysis of glucose (Glu), especially the minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) against MRSA was only 16 mug/mL. Compared with simple ZIF-8
      (32.85%) and ftsZ ASO (58.65%), GOx&HRP@ZIF-8/ASO+Glu exhibited superb biofilm
      destruction ability, and the bacteria removal efficiency of the MRSA biofilm
      could be as high as 88.2%, indicating that the reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      produced by the cascade enzyme reaction imparted the main synergistic
      antibacterial capability, and simultaneously, ftsZ ASO significantly enhanced the
      antibacterial effect by inhibiting the expression of the ftsZ gene. In vivo
      anti-infection treatment experiments revealed that GOx&HRP@ZIF-8/ASO exhibited
      the best wound repairing performance and excellent biocompatibility in the
      presence of Glu. These findings suggested that GOx&HRP@ZIF-8/ASO has favorably
      realized high-efficiency treatment of MRSA infection and filled the gap in the
      antibacterial application of biological enzymes.

TI  - Multi-antibacterial agent-based electrospun polycaprolactone for active wound
      dressing.
LID - 10.1007/s40204-021-00176-1 [doi]
AB  - Today, due to the greater knowledge of the side effects of chemical drugs and the
      favorable pharmacological properties of herbal compounds, the use of these
      compounds is increasing. Since wounds need fast and efficient healing, wound
      dressing fabrication methods play an important role in wound healing. In this
      research, electrospinning process was used to prepare samples. Natural
      antibacterial compounds, such as curcumin, piperine, eugenol, and rutin were
      loaded in electrospun nano-fibrous based on polycaprolactone. Three-component
      novel systems of curcumin-piperine-eugenol (PCPiEu), and curcumin-piperine-rutin 
      (PCPiR) were designed and prepared. Their synergistic effect was investigated and
      also compared with one- and two-component systems. The results showed that medium
      diameter nanofibers of PCPiEu and PCPiR samples was 198.38 and 142.60,
      respectively, and they were obtained in smooth, uniform and bead free morphology 
      using optimization of process parameters. The amount of water absorption and
      water vapor permeability of the three-component samples were in the appropriate
      range (8.33-10.42 mg cm(2) h(-1)) for wound dressings. The mechanical properties 
      of samples were reduced compared to the control sample, which required further
      investigation. Antibacterial tests showed good results for partial toxicity of
      PCPiEu and PCPiR samples. Antibacterial tests showed minor toxicity in PCPiR
      samples and good results were obtained for PCPiEu samples. In addition, the
      results showed that PCPiEu and PCPiR samples exhibited antibacterial activity
      against Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative
      Enterococcus faecalis bacterium, so that killing ability of 74% and 75% against
      Gram-positive bacterium and 99.47% and 96.88% against Gram-negative bacterium
      were obtained for these three systems, respectively.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of ethyl
      acetate (EtOAc) extracts of Arcopilus eremanthusum sp. nov. (CML3766) isolated
      from E. erythopappus. The fungi were identified using the sequences of the
      internal transcribed spacer (ITS), large subunit (LSU), and RNA polymerase II
      second largest subunit (RPB2). Antibacterial activity was determined using the
      minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) method. Antioxidant activity was
      evaluated using free radical scavenging methods with
      1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and
      2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS(*+)) assays and the
      beta-carotene-linoleic acid system. The total phenolic compound content was
      measured using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The endophytic fungal extract
      presented bactericidal activity, with an MBC of 2.44 and 19.5 mug/mL against
      Staphylococcus aureus GL 8702 and GL 5674, respectively, and 625 mug/mL for
      Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. In addition, this fungus demonstrated an
      antioxidant activity of 52.30% protection in the beta-carotene method. The total 
      concentration of phenolic compounds was 23.73 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g. 
      Ferulic acid, trans-cinnamic acid, chlorogenic acid, catechin, vanillin,
      p-coumaric acid, and caffeic acid were quantified using high-performance liquid
      chromatography with diode array detection. The results demonstrate the potential 
      of A. eremanthusum sp. nov. to serve as a source of antibacterial and antioxidant
      metabolites with possible future biotechnological applications.

AB  - Calcium peroxide (CaO2), a common solid peroxide, has been increasingly used in
      contaminated site remediation due to its ability to release oxygen (O2) and
      hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and its environmental friendliness. Our present study is
      first to explore micromechnisms of CaO2 to efficaciously inactivate pathogen
      indicators including gram-negative bacterium of Escherichia coli (E. coli),
      gram-positive bacterium of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and virus of
      Escherichia coli-specific M13 bacteriophage (VCSM13) under low concentration (</=
      4 mmol L(-1) (mM)). The inactivation mechanisms of E. coli, S. aureus (1 mmol
      L(-1) CaO2) and VCSM13 (4 mmol L(-1)) were mainly attributed to OH(-) (32
      approximately 58%) and *OH (34 approximately 42%), followed by H2O2 (13
      approximately 20%) and O2(*-) (10 approximately 12%) generated from CaO2, with
      the observed morphological and physiological-associated damages. Also, average
      steady-state concentrations of (OH(-), *OH, H2O2, and O2(*-)) and their reaction 
      rate constants with E. coli and VCSM13 were determined. Accordingly, the
      micro-mechanism model of inactivation was established and validated, and the
      inactivation efficiency of the same order of magnitude of pathogen was predicted.
      Furthermore, during the common environmental factors, the copper ions was found
      to be promote CaO2 inactivation of pathogens, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) 
      fractions had a negative effect on CaO2 inactivation. The present study explored 
      the mechanisms of CaO2 inactivation of pathogens in real surface water, laying
      the foundation for its potential use in the inactivation of water-borne microbial
      pathogens.

AB  - This study aimed to reveal the quality changes of soy protein-based meat
      analogues at 4 degrees C, and to investigate the efficacy of antimicrobial
      packaging on maintaining the qualities of meat analogues during 10 days of
      storage. Cinnamaldehyde (CI) or tea polyphenols (TP) were incorporated in
      polylactic acid (PLA), polybutylene adipate (PBAT) and starch blends by extrusion
      technique to prepare antimicrobial packaging. The changes of meat analogues were 
      characterized for morphology, water distribution, texture properties and
      microbiological analysis during 10 days of storage. Cinnamaldehyde loaded
      PLA/PBAT film effective retarded the growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) at 4 degrees C, giving an average reduction of 
      E. coli and S. aureus of 3.6 and 4.1 log CFU/g on day 10, respectively. Results
      suggest that PLA/PBAT-CI film successfully prevents moisture from evaporation,
      maintains the texture properties and ensures the quality and safety of meat
      analogues.

TI  - Pharmacodynamics of ceftriaxone for the treatment of methicillin-susceptible
      Staphylococcus aureus: is it a viable treatment option?
PG  - 106537

AB  - Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that may be one option to treat
      methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Although MSSA may be
      susceptible to ceftriaxone, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is
      generally two- to four-fold higher than other susceptible bacterial pathogens.
      This study aimed to explore the pharmacodynamics of ceftriaxone against MSSA and 
      to determine the likely optimal dose. A hollow-fibre infection model was used
      with one clinical MSSA isolate (MIC = 4 mg/L) at an initial inoculum of 1 x 10(6)
      CFU/mL. Ceftriaxone dosing regimens of 1 g once and twice daily and 2 g once and 
      twice daily were simulated. Ceftriaxone 1 g dosing regimens did not substantially
      impact bacterial killing within the first 12 h. Conversely, when administered as 
      a 2 g dose either once or twice daily, an approximate 1-log10 bacterial reduction
      was observed where it plateaued for up to 96 h. No resistance was identified.
      Only a high ceftriaxone dose of 2 g twice daily achieves bacterial killing and
      sustained inhibition of bacterial growth. Ceftriaxone at routinely used doses is 
      unsuitable for the treatment of MSSA infections and alternative agents should be 
      preferentially used.

AB  - Mastitis is part of the aggressive diseases that affecting the development of
      dairy farming. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), an important microbiological agent of 
      gastrointestinal flora, can effectively promote the development of the immune
      system. Herein, the objectives of this study is to explore the protective role of
      LAB on Staphylococcus aureus(S. aureus)-induced mastitis in mice. 88 strains of
      suspected LAB were isolated from the milk of healthy dairy cows. Antibacterial
      activity was screened, and the 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that the
      bacteria were Enterococcus mundtii H81 (E. mundtii H81). Furthermore, the model
      of mastitis has been established by nipple duct injection of S. aureus in mice,
      while E. mundtii H81 was treated 2 h before S. aureus injection. Twenty-four
      hours later of S. aureus infection, the mammary gland tissues were collected. The
      pathological changes of the mammary gland were observed by H&E staining. The
      levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were measured by ELISA and the myeloperoxidase
      (MPO) activity was measured by the MPO assay kit. We also observed the changes of
      nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) by using western blotting. The
      results showed that E. mundtii H81 pretreatment reduced neutrophil infiltration, 
      and significantly reduce the secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, down-regulate
      the phosphorylation of p65 NF-kappaB and IkappaB, and the expression of tight
      junction protein Claudin 3 and ZO-1 was up-regulated. Collectively, our findings 
      showed that E. mundtii H81 protects mammary gland from S. aureus-induced
      mastitis, which may be a candidate of treatment for mastitis infected by S.
      aureus.

AB  - Infectious diseases account for 25% of the causes of death worldwide and this
      rate is expected to increase due to antibiotic resistance. Among the bacteria
      associated with healthcare infections, Staphylococcus aureus is a prevalent
      pathogen and about 50% of the isolates are found to be methicillin-resistant.
      Here we describe the identification of ticarcillin as a weak binder of the S.
      aureus UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase. After a docking screening,
      ticarcillin was identified as a ligand in using the recently proposed isothermal 
      analysis of differential scanning fluorimetry data. Finally, an equilibrium MD
      simulation confirmed the docking binding mode as a stable pose, with large
      contributions to the binding energy coming from interactions between Arg206 and
      Arg207 and the carboxylate groups in ticarcillin.

AB  - Aquatic products with high moisture and protein content are susceptible to
      bacterial growth and spoilage. Searching for efficient and safe natural
      antibacterial agents to preserve aquatic products has been concerned widely. In
      this study, epsilon-poly-lysine-epigallocatechin gallate/sodium alginate-chitosan
      nanoparticles (epsilon-PL-EGCG/SA-CS NPs) were prepared using sodium alginate and
      chitosan as wall materials and epsilon-PL-EGCG as core material. The size of
      nanoparticles was about 200nm and the encapsulation efficiency was 78.2%.
      Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirmed the prepared spherical
      nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and multifunctional
      polycrystalline X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra indicated that epsilon-PL-EGCG
      was encapsulated in the nanoparticles. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA)
      illustrated that the thermal stability of encapsulated epsilon-PL-EGCG was
      improved more than that of bare epsilon-PL-EGCG. In addition, in vitro release
      assays showed that the epsilon-PL-EGCG was released continuously over 36h.
      Bacteria inhibition results showed that the epsilon-PL-EGCG/SA-CS NPs
      significantly inhibited specific spoilage bacteria E3 that screened out of
      aquatic products, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In conclusion,
      epsilon-PL-EGCG/SA-CS NPs are an effective antibacterial means with wide
      application prospects in the field of aquatic products preservation.

TI  - pH-responsive hierarchical H2S-releasing nano-disinfectant with deep-penetrating 
      and anti-inflammatory properties for synergistically enhanced eradication of
      bacterial biofilms and wound infection.
PG  - 55

AB  - BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilm-associated
      bacterial infection is the primary cause of nosocomial infection and has long
      been an ongoing threat to public health. MRSA biofilms are often resistant to
      multiple antimicrobial strategies, mainly due to the existence of a compact
      protective barrier; thus, protecting themselves from the innate immune system and
      antibiotic treatment via limited drug penetration. RESULTS: A hierarchically
      structured hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-releasing nano-disinfectant was presented,
      which was composed of a zinc sulfide (ZnS) core as a H2S generator and
      indocyanine green (ICG) as a photosensitizer. This nano-disinfectant (ICG-ZnS
      NPs) sensitively responded to the biofilm microenvironment and demonstrated
      efficient eradication of MRSA biofilms via a synergistic effect of Zn(2+), gas
      molecule-mediated therapy, and hyperthermia. Physically boosted by released H2S
      and a near-infrared spectroscopy-induced hyperthermia effect, ICG-ZnS NPs
      destroyed the compactness of MRSA biofilms showing remarkable deep-penetration
      capability. Moreover, on-site generation of H2S gas adequately ameliorated
      excessive inflammation, suppressed secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and
      expedited angiogenesis, therefore markedly accelerating the in vivo healing
      process of cutaneous wounds infected with MRSA biofilms. CONCLUSION: ICG-ZnS NPs 
      combined with NIR laser irradiation exhibited significant anti-biofilm activity
      in MRSA biofilms, can accelerate the healing process through deep-penetration and
      anti-inflammatory effectuation. The proposed strategy has great potential as an
      alternative to antibiotic treatment when combating multidrug-resistant bacterial 
      biofilms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a
      serious epidemiological problem worldwide. In this study we aimed to investigate 
      recently-isolated MRSA types and determine their characteristics. METHODS: We
      collected 164 strains isolated from 13 hospitals located in Tokyo and surrounding
      prefectures. In addition to drug resistance test, we sequenced whole genomes of
      the prevalent MRSA clones and analyzed their genomic characteristics, such as
      drug resistance genes, virulence factor genes, and genome arrangements. RESULTS: 
      Multi-locus sequencing typing showed that 51% of the SCCmec MRSA isolates
      belonged to clonal complex 1 (CC1). Staphylococcus protein A gene (spa) typing
      showed that 91% of these CC1 isolates could be categorized as t1784 type. These
      CC1/t1784 isolates possessed genes encoding erythromycin resistance protein,
      spectinomycin 9-adenylyltransferase, and staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEA, SEI,
      SEM), but not the pvl gene encoding Panton-Valentine leucocidin. Complete genomic
      analysis of nine CC1/t1784 isolates showed that they shared an intact phage,
      which carried no annotated virulence factor genes except for two encoding a
      hypothetical membrane protein and a teichoic acid biosynthesis protein. No
      significant genomic rearrangements were observed among the CC1/t1784 isolates.
      CONCLUSION: These data and previous reports indicated that this CC1/t1784 clone
      has been expanding rapidly in Japan without genomic changes.

TI  - Serum Stable and Low Hemolytic Temporin-SHa Peptide Analogs Disrupt Cell Membrane
      of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
LID - 10.1007/s12602-022-09915-7 [doi]
AB  - Anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) have attracted major attention due to their
      potential bio-activities against some multidrug resistant pathogens. The present 
      study evaluated the mechanism of actions of highly potent AMP temporin-SHa
      analogs, i.e., [G4a]-SHa, [G7a]-SHa, and [G10a]-SHa, against
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) NCTC (13277) with minimum
      inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 14.35, 7.16, and 3.58 microM, respectively.
      These analogs exhibited significant anti-MRSA activity at physiological salt
      concentration, 30% fetal bovine serum, and 30% human serum. [G4a]-SHa and
      [G7a]-SHa were non-hemolytic and non-cytotoxic to normal mouse fibroblast 3T3
      cell and human Caco-2 cell line. Atomic force microscopy revealed that these
      analogs have profound effect on the morphological changes in MRSA surface with
      significant leakage of cell cytoplasmic content. Propidium iodide uptake kinetic 
      assay and (bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol) DiBAC4(3) membrane
      depolarization assay demonstrated that these analogs display a membrane
      disrupting property, characterized by elevation of plasma membrane permeability
      and rapid transmembrane potential depolarization. [G10a]-SHa showed a significant
      anti-biofilm activity against biofilm forming S. aureus (ATCC 6538). Acute in
      vivo toxicity studies revealed that [G10a]-SHa possesses some toxic effect at
      100-mg/kg dose. While [G4a]-SHa at 100 mg/kg, i.p. has no toxic effect even after
      48 h, [G7a]-SHa also did not show any toxic effect at the dose of 100 mg/kg, i.p.
      during 24-h observation of animals. In conclusion, [G4a]-SHa, [G7a]-SHa, and
      [G10a]-SHa show improved activity against MRSA and stability compared to SHa
      peptide. Although highly potent, [G10a]-SHa, due to its hemolytic activity, might
      be more suitable for topical application, whereas [G4a]-SHa and [G7a]-SHa have
      potential to be used for systemic application.

      NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES IN UKRAINE: RESULTS OF A MULTICENTER STUDY (2018-2020).
PG  - 27-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: To obtain the first estimates the incidence of surgical site 
      infection in patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures and antimicrobial
      resistance of responsible pathogens, and determine their impact on inpatient
      mortality in Ukraine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: We performed a
      multicenter prospective study was patient-based data of SSIs were according to
      CDC/NHSN methodology. This study included patients undergoing a neurosurgical
      procedure in 11 tertiary care hospitals from different regions of Ukraine from
      January 1st, 2018 to December 31st, 2020. RESULTS: Results: A total of 1697
      neurosurgical procedures associated with a 90-day SSI were identified (19.4% of
      8741 procedures). Of these, 69.5% SSI were identified after craniotomy and 30.5% 
      after ventricular shunt. The Meningitis or ventriculitis (20.9%) were found to be
      the most common underlying condition among these patients followed by
      Intracranial infection (18.7%), and Osteomyelitis (14.6%) congenital
      malformation. Over a 90-day surveillance period, 387 died (4.4%). Fifty seven
      percent of deaths in SSI patients were attributable to infection. Meningitis or
      ventriculitis and Intracranial infection were associated with a higher mortality.
      Craniotomy was associated with a higher mortality more frequently than did
      Ventricular shunt. Escherichia coli were most commonly reported, accounting for
      26.3% of all organisms, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter spp.,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Meticillin 
      resistance was found in 33.7% of S. aureus isolates, and vancomycin resistance
      was found in 12.7% of enterococci. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The incidence of SSI 
      and mortality after neurosurgical procedures in Ukraine is high. This is due to
      increase emergence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens and risk factors in
      neurosurgery patients.

TI  - Propolis antibacterial and antioxidant synergisms with gentamicin and honey.
LID - 10.1111/jam.15440 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Assess the antibacterial and antioxidant effects of ethanol extracts of
      Portuguese propolis samples when combined with gentamicin, a widely used
      aminoglycoside antibiotic, or with honey, collected from the same apiary as
      propolis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the agar dilution method and DPPH free
      radical scavenging assay, antimicrobial and antioxidant synergistic effects
      between propolis and gentamicin or honey were assessed. Synergism between
      propolis and gentamicin was observed for all the tested extracts and against all 
      the indicator bacteria, with particular interest against the
      Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with a threefold decrease of
      the gentamicin MIC if mixed with 25 microg ml(-1) propolis. Likely to propolis
      and gentamicin, mixtures of sub-MIC concentrations of propolis and honey enhanced
      the antibacterial action of each individual natural product against the majority 
      of the strains. However, propolis antioxidant capacity decreased along with
      higher honey content in the mixture. CONCLUSIONS: Propolis has a strong
      synergistic effect when combined with gentamicin, allowing the reduction of the
      therapeutic dose of this drug. Propolis and honey mixtures also display a
      stronger antibacterial effect than the activity exhibited by each sample when
      tested individually, whereas the high antioxidant capacity of propolis seems to
      be not affected when in combination with honey. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY:
      When mixed with honey, propolis antioxidant potential is maintained, or just
      slightly reduced up to 1:1 dilution, and show synergistic antibacterial effects, 
      allowing to optimize the use of this usually scarce natural resource. Also,
      considering the antibiotic resistance problem, natural beehive products, alone or
      in the mixture, are promising alternatives to retard the outbreak of microbial
      resistance.

TI  - Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP): a sensitive molecular tool for
      detection of Staphylococcus aureus in meat and dairy product.
LID - 10.1007/s42770-021-00659-0 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus-mediated food poisoning is a primary concern worldwide. The
      presence of the organism in food is an indicative of poor sanitation during
      production, and it is essential to have efficient methods for detecting this
      pathogen. A novel molecular diagnostic technique called loop-mediated isothermal 
      amplification (LAMP) serves as a rapid and sensitive detection method, which
      amplifies nucleic acids at isothermal conditions. In this study, a LAMP-based
      diagnostic assay was developed to detect Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) using 
      two target genes femA and arcC. The optimum reaction temperature was found to be 
      65 degrees C and at 60 degrees C for femA and arcC genes, respectively. The
      developed assay specifically amplified DNA from S. aureus, not from other related
      bacterial species and compared to PCR, and a 100-fold higher sensitivity was
      observed. Furthermore, the LAMP assay could detect the pathogen from food samples
      mainly meat and dairy samples when analyzed in both intact and enriched
      conditions. Thirteen samples were found positive for S. aureus with LAMP showing 
      a greater number of positive samples in comparison to PCR. This study established
      a highly sensitive and a rapid diagnostic procedure for the detection and
      surveillance of this major foodborne pathogen.

TI  - Brain imaging determinants of functional prognosis after severe endocarditis: a
      multicenter observational study.
LID - 10.1007/s10072-021-05789-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We developed a detailed imaging phenotype of the cerebral
      complications in critically ill patients with infective endocarditis (IE) and
      determine whether any specific imaging pattern could impact prognostic
      information. METHODS: One hundred ninety-two patients admitted to the intensive
      care units of seven tertiary centers with severe, definite left IE and
      neurological complications were included. All underwent cerebral imaging few days
      after admission to define the types of lesions, their volumes, and their
      locations using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM). We employed uni- and
      multi-variate logistic regression analyses to explore the associations among
      imaging features and other prognostic variables and the 6-month modified Rankin
      Scale (mRS) score. RESULTS: Ischemic lesions were the most common lesions (75%;
      mean volume, 15.3 +/- 33 mL) followed by microbleeds (50%; mean number, 4 +/-
      7.5), subarachnoidal hemorrhages (20%), hemorrhagic strokes (16%; mean volume,
      14.6 +/- 21 mL), and hemorrhagic transformations (10%; mean volume, 5.6 +/- 11
      mL). The volume of hemorrhagic transformations, the severity of leukopathy, and
      the compromises of certain locations on the motor pathway from the VLSM were
      associated with a poor 6-month mRS score on univariate analyses. However, upon
      multivariate analyses, no such specific imaging pattern independently predicted
      the mRS; this was instead influenced principally by age (OR = 1.03 [1.004-1.06]) 
      and cardiac surgery status (OR = 0.06 [0.02-0.16]) in the entire cohort, and by
      age (OR = 1.04 [1.01-1.08]) and Staphylococcus aureus status (OR = 2.86
      [1.19-6.89]) in operated patients. CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of severely ill IE
      patients with neurological complications, no specific imaging pattern could be
      highlighted as a reliable predictor of prognosis.

TI  - Review of Early Signs of Breast Implant Infection.
LID - 10.1007/s00266-021-02702-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast implant infection remains a problem despite various prevention
      methods. Common pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus typically present acutely
      with fever, erythema, swelling, and pain. However, with the increasing occurrence
      of mycobacterial infections, associated early signs and symptoms are typically
      absent, making early detection difficult. METHOD: A retrospective chart review of
      patients who underwent esthetic breast augmentation by senior surgeon FDP in an
      outpatient surgical facility from 1992 to 2021 was conducted. Cases of infections
      and related information including infection onset, presenting signs and symptoms,
      and culture results were recorded. Presentation differences between infections
      caused by common pathogens and mycobacteria were compared. RESULTS: A total of
      nine infections were reported in 365 patients. Seven cases were due to common
      pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant
      staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and staphylococcus epidermidis. Fever, erythema was
      presented within an average of 10 days after surgery. Two cases were due to
      mycobacterium chelonae (non-tuberculous mycobacterium) infection. In the latter, 
      the earliest signs and symptoms consisted of mild pain and swelling in the
      absence of fever and erythema, which began on average of 54 days after the
      operation. CONCLUSION: Common breast implant infection pathogens usually present 
      early with fever and erythema. However, our study found that non-tuberculous
      mycobacteria infections occur much later and fever and erythema are typically
      absent. The purpose of this study is to increase the awareness of clinicians with
      this rare but rapidly increasing variety of infections and to advise the
      operating surgeon to include mycobacteria infections in the differential
      diagnosis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a

AB  - BACKGROUND: The nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus introduces risks for
      subsequent infections, the rate of which is particularly high in children. The
      colonization mechanisms of S. aureus are not fully understood. METHODS: The
      epidemiological characteristics of nasal colonizing strains from pediatric
      patients undergoing liver transplantation and healthy pre-school children were
      analyzed first. Phenotypes, including biofilm formation and hemolytic activity,
      were tested for all the isolates. Bacterial pathogenicity indicated by a mouse
      skin abscess model and resistance to antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) was compared
      between the predominant genotypes from each group. RESULTS: The ST188 clone
      dominated in healthy children, whereas ST59 was prevalent for the pediatric
      patients. Although ST22 was the second most abundant genotype in the patient
      group, it was rarely found in healthy children. Interestingly, the colonizing
      ST59 and ST22 genotypes were more virulent, as indicated by the increased ability
      for hemolysis in vitro and severe subcutaneous abscesses in the mouse model,
      compared with ST188. We observed that the virulent ST59 and ST22 displayed higher
      resistance to antibiotics compared with ST188. Most of the ST59 and ST22 were
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and all of the ST188 strains were
      methicillin-susceptible (MSSA). Moreover, we observed that the virulent ST59 and 
      ST22 can resist killing by human antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Mechanically,
      upon stimulation by AMPs, the virulent S. aureus can induce high expression of a 
      phenol-soluble modulin transporter (Pmt) system. CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients
      can be colonized by virulent S. aureus clones, which are able to resist AMPs'
      killing through the Pmt system. The residence of virulent strains necessitates
      the continuous monitoring of potential infections, as well as annealing, to take 
      protective decolonization measures.

AB  - Emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria is evolving at an alarming pace;
      therefore, we must start turning to alternative approaches. One of these, could
      be the use of antibiotic adjuvants that enhances the effect of antibiotics
      towards resistant bacteria. A novel antibiotic adjuvant is cannabidiol (CBD),
      which we have previously shown can enhance the effect of bacitracin (BAC). BAC
      targets cell wall synthesis by inhibiting dephosphorylation of the lipid carrier 
      undecaprenyl pyrophosphate prior to recycling across the membrane. However, the
      mechanism underlying this CBD mediated potentiation of BAC has remained unknown. 
      To explore this, we examined resistance to CBD in Staphylococcus aureus through
      daily exposures to CBD. By subsequent whole genome sequencing, we observed
      multiple genes to be mutated, including the farE/farR system encoding a fatty
      acid efflux pump (FarE) and its regulator (FarR). Importantly, recreation of
      mutations in these genes showed decreased susceptibility towards the combination 
      of CBD and BAC. Furthermore, we searched the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library
      for CBD susceptible strains and identified menH encoding a protein participating 
      in menaquinone biosynthesis. Strains containing deletions in this and other
      menaquinone related genes showed increased susceptibility towards CBD, while
      addition of exogenous menaquinone reversed the effect and reduced susceptible
      towards CBD. These results suggest that CBD potentiates BAC by redirecting the
      isoprenoid precursor isopentenyl pyrophosphate towards production of menaquinone 
      rather than the lipid carrier undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, which dephosphorylation
      is inhibited by BAC. This in turn might decrease the level of undecaprenyl
      pyrophosphate thus enhancing the effect of BAC. Our study illustrates how
      antibiotic adjuvants may apply to enhance efficacy of antimicrobial compounds.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses great threats to human
      health. In this research, we found that the newly discovered bacteriocin
      plantaricin GZ1-27 could efficiently inhibit the MRSA, with a MIC of 32 mug/mL.
      Comprehensive investigations were carried out by analysis of K(+) leakage,
      propidium iodide assay, and cell ultra-structure analysis with scanning electron 
      microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results consistently showed 
      that plantaricin GZ1-27 could increase the permeability of the membrane and
      impair its integrity, which induced the collapse of the cell structure and thus
      led to cell death. Furthermore, by sensory evaluation and biochemical analysis,
      it was found that plantaricin GZ1-27 combined with chitosan could significantly
      improve the preservation of pork when applied to the surface of meat slices.
      Overall, our research clearly showed the anti-MRSA bactericidal mechanism of
      plantaricin GZ1-27, which, together with its preliminary application trials in
      pork, suggested plantaricin GZ1-27 could be a potential anti-MRSA agent and is
      promising to be applied in pork preservation to extend the shelf life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the antibacterial activity
      of three different herbal extracts against oral bacteria and their bioactive
      composition. METHODS: Using the disk diffusion technique, the antibacterial
      activities of three different extracts (lemongrass, sage, and guava leaf) were
      evaluated against oral bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and
      Enterococcus faecalis). Additionally, the bioactive components of the herbal
      extracts were assessed by employing the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
      technique. RESULTS: The sage, lemongrass, and guava leaf extracts suppressed the 
      proliferation of all three tested bacterial strains at different rates. The
      phytochemical analysis revealed that sage extract possessed the highest content
      of antioxidants, phenols, and flavonoid compounds. The gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry analysis of the tested plants revealed the presence of vital
      bioactive compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Lemongrass, sage, and guava leaf extracts have 
      potent antibacterial activities, are rich in bioactive compounds, and could be
      utilized as natural remedies for the prevention of oral diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates in
      Taiwan were resistant to clindamycin (CL). MRSA USA300 (ST8), usually susceptible
      to clindamycin and prevailing in North America, was rarely identified in Taiwan
      till October 2015. Recently we found the increasing susceptibility of clinical
      MRSA isolates to clindamycin, which prompted us to figure out the changing
      molecular epidemiology of MRSA. METHODS: Reviewing the antibiograms of clinical
      MRSA isolates in our hospital from 2008 to 2018, we found that clindamycin
      susceptibility (CLI-S) rate significantly increased from 4.9% (293/5979) in 2008 
      to 33.2% (1058/3184) in 2018 (Ptrend < 0.001). MRSA isolates identified from
      bloodstream and pediatric patients, which were systematically preserved, in 2008,
      2013, 2017 and 2018 were selected for characterization. RESULTS: Molecular
      analysis revealed that of the 496 CLI-S MRSA isolates, USA300 (characterized as
      SCCmec type IV/PVL genes-positive/ACME-positive) accounted for none in 2008, 6.5%
      in 2013, to 44.4% in 2017 and 48.8% in 2018 for pediatric isolates (Ptrend <
      0.001) and accounted for none in 2008, 7.1% in 2013, to 47.1% in 2017 and 50.6%
      in 2018 for bloodstream isolates (Ptrend < 0.001). Whole genome sequencing
      revealed that 80% of 74 domestic USA300 isolates were clustered in three clades
      and all but one isolates belonged to a global clone diverged in 1994 while
      further diverged in Taiwan between 2003 and 2006. CONCLUSIONS:
      Clindamycin-susceptibility to MRSA increased significantly from 2008 to 2018 in
      northern Taiwan, mostly attributing to the increase of USA300. Most of USA300
      strains circulating in Taiwan were imported at multiple occasions.

AB  - Multinational surveillance programmes for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA) are dependent on national structures for data collection. This
      study aimed to capture the diversity of national MRSA surveillance programmes and
      to propose a framework for harmonisation of MRSA surveillance. The International 
      Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (ISAC) MRSA Working Group conducted a
      structured survey on MRSA surveillance programmes and organised a webinar to
      discuss the programmes' strengths and challenges as well as guidelines for
      harmonisation. Completed surveys represented 24 MRSA surveillance programmes in
      16 countries. Several countries reported separate epidemiological and
      microbiological surveillance. Informing clinicians and national policy-makers
      were the most common purposes of surveillance. Surveillance of bloodstream
      infections (BSIs) was present in all programmes. Other invasive infections were
      often included. Three countries reported active surveillance of MRSA carriage.
      Methodology and reporting of antimicrobial susceptibility, virulence factors,
      molecular genotyping and epidemiological metadata varied greatly. Current MRSA
      surveillance programmes rely upon heterogeneous data collection systems, which
      hampers international epidemiological monitoring and research. To harmonise MRSA 
      surveillance, we suggest improving the integration of microbiological and
      epidemiological data, implementation of central biobanks for MRSA isolate
      collection, and inclusion of a representative sample of skin and soft-tissue
      infection cases in addition to all BSI cases.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may persist for long periods
      due to biofilm formation. The objective of this study was to describe biofilm
      formation in association with the presence of S. aureus surface protein G (sasG) 
      and its allelic variants in MRSA bacteraemia isolates from endemic (CC5, CC8,
      CC22) and sporadic clones in Spain (2008-2015). Crystal violet staining was used 
      to assess biofilm formation; DNA microarray, RT-qPCR, and long-read whole genome 
      sequencing were applied to determine the presence, expression and structure of
      sasG, respectively. The endemic CC5 and CC8 clones produced more biofilm than the
      sporadic clones; these endemic clones carried sasG allelic variant 1. Otherwise, 
      sporadic clones, with less biofilm formation, showed either an absence of sasG
      (65%) or the presence of allelic variant 2 (35%). Variants 1 and 2 differed in
      the expression of sasG (1.56+/-1.20 and 0.37+/-0.32, respectively). The analysis 
      of a large cohort of closed S. aureus genomes available on the NCBI database
      confirmed the distribution of the two allelic variants with low amino acid
      identity (68.1%) among endemic and sporadic clones. SasG variant 1 present in the
      major CC5 and CC8 clones was correlated with increased biofilm formation and may 
      represent an important virulence determinant.

TI  - The pathogenesis of prevalent aerobic bacteria in aerobic vaginitis and adverse
      pregnancy outcomes: a narrative review.
PG  - 21
LID - 10.1186/s12978-021-01292-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aerobic vaginitis is a common cause of vaginal discharge in
      reproductive-age women, increasing the risk of negative pregnancy outcomes such
      as premature delivery, abortion, premature rupture of membranes and stillbirth.
      However, the aetiology and pathogenesis of aerobic vaginitis causing negative
      pregnancy outcomes are still unclear, and there is no unified and standardized
      treatment method for aerobic vaginitis in the pregnancy period. METHODS: We
      conducted a literature search of published studies in the English language
      focusing on aerobic vaginitis and its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes
      utilizing PubMed and Web of Science from January 1973 through June 2021. The
      common pathogenic bacteria of aerobic vaginitis during pregnancy, such as group B
      Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as the related adverse pregnancy outcomes and
      existing treatments were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 4534 articles were
      identified, and 97 studies that had inclusion criteria were subjected to careful 
      review. The pathogenic bacteria of aerobic vaginitis can produce different toxins
      or affect the local immunity of patients and then lead to the occurrence of
      infection. Fresh wet mount microscopy is the preferred diagnostic method for
      aerobic vaginitis. Clindamycin is a common antibiotic used for aerobic vaginitis 
      in pregnant women. The use of products combining probiotics has achieved
      excellent treatment success. CONCLUSIONS: Future research in this field can
      provide insights regarding the mechanism of aerobic vaginitis-induced adverse
      pregnancy outcomes in humans and ways to prevent their occurrence.

OAB - Aerobic vaginitis is an infection of the vagina that increases the risk of
      negative pregnancy outcomes. The aetiology and pathogenesis of aerobic vaginitis 
      causing negative pregnancy outcomes are still unclear. This paper reviews the
      common pathogenic bacteria of aerobic vaginitis during pregnancy, and the related
      adverse pregnancy outcomes. We also review the existing treatment. Currently, it 
      is believed that the microflora in aerobic vaginitis is composed of commensal
      aerobic microorganisms of intestinal origin, and the most frequently encountered 
      bacteria are group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus,
      Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The pathogenic bacteria of
      aerobic vaginitis can produce different toxins or affect the local immunity of
      patients and then lead to the occurrence of infection. Fresh wet mount microscopy
      is the preferred diagnostic method for aerobic vaginitis. Clindamycin is a common
      antibiotic used for aerobic vaginitis in pregnant women. The use of products
      combining probiotics has achieved excellent treatment success. This study
      provides a reference for future research and early diagnosis and treatment during
      pregnancy. Future research in this field can provide insights regarding the
      mechanisms of aerobic vaginitis-induced adverse pregnancy outcomes in humans and 
      ways to prevent their occurrence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treating the symptoms 
      of movement disorders can be life changing for patients. Thus, the 5%-15%
      incidence of stimulator-related infection requiring removal of the device can be 
      particularly disheartening. Although DBS system reimplantation is generally
      successful, this is not always the case. The literature is replete with
      publications describing the incidence of infection and the associated features.
      However, the literature is sparse in terms of information on the incidence of
      recurrent or recrudescent infection after system reimplantation. The goal of this
      paper was to evaluate factors leading to unsuccessful reimplantation of a DBS
      system following initial infection. METHODS: Data were reviewed for all DBS
      procedures performed by one surgeon (K.L.H.) over 19 years including the
      infectious agent, location of infection, treatment regimen, and subsequent
      reimplantation of a DBS system and long-term outcome. RESULTS: In this series of 
      558 patients who had undergone DBS surgery, 37 (6.6%) subsequently developed an
      infection. Infections with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus,
      Enterobacter species, or coagulase-negative staphylococci were predominant. Four 
      patients had cerebritis, one had meningitis, and the rest had soft tissue
      infections of the pocket or scalp. All had their entire DBS system explanted,
      followed by 4-6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics and surveillance for
      recrudescence for an additional period of at least 30 days. Twenty-five patients 
      subsequently underwent DBS system reimplantation, and the procedure was
      successful in 22. Three of the 4 patients with cerebritis developed a subsequent 
      wound infection after system reimplantation. None of the other 22 patients
      developed a recurrence. The odds ratio for developing a recurrent infection after
      cerebritis was 28.5 (95% CI 1.931-420.5, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: This study, the
      largest series of DBS system reimplantations following infection, demonstrated
      that most patients can have successful reimplantations without recurrent
      infection. However, patients who have had DBS-related cerebritis have a nearly
      30-fold increased risk of developing reinfection after reimplantation.
      Alternative strategies for these patients are discussed.

TI  - Zinc sequestration by human calprotectin facilitates manganese binding to the
      bacterial solute-binding proteins PsaA and MntC.
LID - mfac001 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/mtomcs/mfac001 [doi]
AB  - Zinc is an essential transition metal nutrient for bacterial survival and growth 
      but may become toxic when present at elevated levels. The Gram-positive bacterial
      pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to zinc poisoning, which results
      in growth inhibition and lower resistance to oxidative stress. S. pneumoniae has 
      a relatively high manganese requirement and zinc toxicity in this pathogen has
      been attributed to the coordination of Zn(II) at the Mn(II) site of the
      solute-binding protein (SBP) PsaA, which prevents Mn(II) uptake by the PsaABC
      transport system. In this work, we investigate the Zn(II)-binding properties of
      pneumococcal PsaA and staphylococcal MntC, a related SBP expressed by another
      Gram-positive bacterial pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, that contributes to
      Mn(II) uptake. X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies demonstrate that both SBPs 
      harbor Zn(II) sites best described as five-coordinate, and metal-binding studies 
      in solution show that both SBPs bind Zn(II) reversibly with sub-nanomolar
      affinities. Moreover, both SBPs exhibit a strong thermodynamic preference for
      Zn(II) ions, which readily displace bound Mn(II) ions from these proteins. We
      also evaluate the Zn(II) competition between these SBPs and the human S100
      protein calprotectin (CP, S100A8/S100A9 oligomer), an abundant host-defense
      protein that is involved in the metal-withholding innate immune response. CP can 
      sequester Zn(II) from PsaA and MntC, which facilitates Mn(II) binding to the
      SBPs. These results demonstrate that CP can inhibit Zn(II) poisoning of the SBPs 
      and provide molecular insight into how S100 proteins may inadvertently benefit
      bacterial pathogens rather than the host.

AB  - Recombinant E. coli producing intein-cleavable polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase
      fusions mediates the intracellular formation of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)
      particles densely coated with intein-cleavable target protein fusion. These PHA
      particles can be efficiently purified from lysed cells. The self-cleaving intein 
      performs as a bio-linker between the PHA synthase and the target protein. The
      tagless target protein can be released as pure soluble protein from the PHA
      particles by a simple pH reduction to 6.0. Here we describe that PHA particles
      serve as bioseparation resin for purification of soluble target proteins with
      pharmaceutical grade purity, similar to commercial affinity separation
      technologies. This cost-effective technique does not involve multiple complicated
      protein purification procedures, and we have exploited this approach to purify
      six target proteins: green fluorescent protein (GFP) from A. victoria, antigen
      Rv1626 from M. tuberculosis, the immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding ZZ domain of
      protein A derived from Staphylococcus aureus, human tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNFalpha), human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and human
      interferon alpha 2b (IFNalpha2b).

TI  - Biomedical applications of L-alanine produced by Pediococcus acidilactici BD16
      (alaD(+)).
LID - 10.1007/s00253-022-11766-9 [doi]
AB  - L-alanine possesses extensive physiological functionality and tremendous
      pharmacological significance, therefore could be considered as potential
      ingredient for food, pharmaceutical, and personal care products. However,
      therapeutic properties of L-alanine still need to be addressed in detail to
      further strengthen its utilization as a viable ingredient for developing natural 
      therapeutics with minimum side effects. Thus, the present study was aimed to
      explore the anticipated therapeutic potential of L-alanine, produced microbially 
      using a lactic acid bacterial strain Pediococcus acidilactici BD16 (alaD(+))
      expressing L-alanine dehydrogenase enzyme. The anticipated therapeutic potential 
      of L-alanine was assessed in terms of anti-proliferative, anti-bacterial, and
      anti-urolithiatic properties. Anti-bacterial assays revealed that L-alanine
      successfully inhibited growth and in vitro proliferation of important human
      pathogens including Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
      pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and Vibrio cholerae in a 
      concentration-dependent manner. Current investigation has also revealed its
      significant anti-proliferative potential against human lung adenocarcinoma (A549;
      IC50 7.32 muM) and mammary gland adenocarcinoma (MCF-7; IC50 8.81 muM) cells. The
      anti-urolithiatic potential of L-alanine was augmented over three different
      phases, viz., nucleation inhibition, aggregation inhibition, and oxalate
      depletion. Further, an in vitro cell culture-based kidney stone dissolution model
      using HEK293-T cells was also established to further strengthen its
      anti-urolithiatic potential. This is probably the first in vitro cell
      culture-based model which experimentally validates the immense therapeutic
      efficacy of L-alanine in treating urolithiasis disease. KEY POINTS: * Assessment 
      of therapeutic potential of L-alanine produced by LAB. * L-alanine exhibited
      significant anti-proliferative and anti-bacterial activities. * L-alanine as
      potential anti-urolithiatic agent.

TI  - Modular Synthetic Routes to Fluorine-Containing Halogenated Phenazine and
      Acridine Agents That Induce Rapid Iron Starvation in Methicillin-Resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus Biofilms.
PG  - 280-295
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.1c00402 [doi]
AB  - During infection, bacteria use an arsenal of resistance mechanisms to negate
      antibiotic therapies. In addition, pathogenic bacteria form surface-attached
      biofilms bearing enriched populations of metabolically dormant persister cells.
      Bacteria develop resistance in response to antibiotic insults; however,
      nonreplicating biofilms are innately tolerant to all classes of antibiotics. As
      such, molecules that can eradicate antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-tolerant
      bacteria are of importance. Here, we report modular synthetic routes to
      fluorine-containing halogenated phenazine (HP) and halogenated acridine (HA)
      agents with potent antibacterial and biofilm-killing activities. Nine fluorinated
      phenazines were rapidly accessed through a synthetic strategy involving (1)
      oxidation of fluorinated anilines to azobenzene intermediates, (2) SNAr with
      2-methoxyaniline, and (3) cyclization to phenazines upon treatment with
      trifluoroacetic acid. Five structurally related acridine heterocycles were
      synthesized using SNAr and Buchwald-Hartwig approaches. From this focused
      collection, phenazines 5g, 5h, 5i, and acridine 9c demonstrated potent
      antibacterial activities against Gram-positive pathogens (MIC = 0.04-0.78 muM).
      Additionally, 5g and 9c eradicated Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus
      epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis biofilms with excellent potency (5g, MBEC =
      4.69-6.25 muM; 9c, MBEC = 4.69-50 muM). Using real-time quantitative polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-qPCR), 5g, 5h, 5i, and 9c rapidly induce the transcription of 
      iron uptake biomarkers isdB and sbnC in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)
      biofilms, and we conclude that these agents operate through iron starvation.
      Overall, fluorinated phenazine and acridine agents could lead to ground-breaking 
      advances in the treatment of challenging bacterial infections.

      the antimicrobial activities of natural active substances that can be a source
      for new drug candidates. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      antibacterial activity of components such as alpha-pinene (alpha-PN), p-cymene
      (p-CYM), carvacrol (CAR), thymol (TY) and eugenol (EG) found in the essential
      oils of many plants and their synergistic interaction with antibiotics. In this
      study, the antibacterial activity of these essential oil components and
      antibiotics in clinical use such as gentamicin (GEN), tetracycline (TET),
      tigecycline (TGC) and linezolid (LZD), against Staphylococcus aureus [methicillin
      resistant S.aureus (MRSA), and methicillin sensitive S.aureus (MSSA)],
      Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were determined by disc
      diffusion and microdilution method. In addition, the interaction between the
      essential oil components and antibiotics was also determined by the checkerboard 
      method. While CAR, TY and EG components showed strong antibacterial activity, the
      antibacterial activity of alphaPN and p-CYM was found to be weak. Combinations of
      alpha-pinene, carvacrol, thymol and eugenol with gentamicin and tetracycline
      mostly showed synergistic interactions against all bacteria. In alphaPN, CAR, TY 
      and EG with GEN and TET, synergistic/partial synergistic interaction was observed
      against S.aureus strains, while indifferent interaction was detected in E.coli
      and P.aeruginosa strains. The combination of alphaPN and p-CYM with TGC showed
      synergistic interaction against E.coli and P.aeruginosa strains, and additive and
      indifferent interaction against S.aureus strains. On the other hand, synergistic 
      interaction was observed against all bacterial strains in combinations of TGC and
      CAR, TY and EG components. Antagonistic interaction was not detected in any of
      the tested component-antibiotic combinations against the bacteria used in our
      study. A synergistic interaction between natural bioactive components and
      commonly used antibiotics may contribute to the effectiveness of antibiotics and 
      components at lower doses, minimizing their potential toxic side effects and
      reducing treatment costs. However, more research is needed in terms of their
      pharmacokinetic and toxic properties to evaluate the therapeutic application
      potential of phytochemicals.

AB  - Genetic defects in interleukin-12/23/17 immunity are associated with an increased
      risk of Staphylococcus aureus and herpesvirus skin infections. This study
      analysed spontaneous safety reports from the WHO Pharmacovigilance Center of
      bacterial skin or herpesvirus infections associated with secukinumab, ustekinumab
      and tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors. Associations found in
      disproportionality analyses were expressed as reporting odds ratios (ROR). For
      bacterial skin infections, ustekinumab showed the strongest association (ROR
      6.09; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 5.44-6.81), and, among the tumour necrosis
      factor-alpha inhibitors, infliximab showed the strongest association (ROR 4.18;
      95% CI 3.97-4.40). Risk was comparable between infliximab and secukinumab (ROR
      3.51; 95% CI 3.00-4.09). Secukinumab showed the strongest association with herpes
      simplex infection (ROR 4.80; 95% CI 3.78-6.10). All biologics were equally
      associated with herpes zoster. Infliximab was the only biologic associated with
      cytomegalovirus infection (ROR 5.66; 95% CI 5.08-6.31) and had the strongest
      association with Epstein-Barr virus infection (ROR 6.90; 95% CI 6.03-7.90). All
      biologics evaluated were positively associated with bacterial skin infections,
      herpes simplex, and herpes zoster, compared with all other drugs in the WHO
      database for which individual case safety reports were collected. The possibility
      of under-reporting, reporting bias and difference in causality assessment between
      countries and reporters must be taken into account when interpreting the results 
      of disproportionality analyses.

AB  - Introduction: Aerobic vaginitis (AV) is a type of vaginal infection that occurs
      at the reproductive age of women. In this study, we aimed to study the possible
      anti-AV therapeutic effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and L-carnitine (LC) 
      in the mouse model. Methods: AV model was established by intra-vaginal
      inoculation of 10(8) CFU/mL Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (1:1) in
      adult NMRI mice. Susceptibilities of the bacteria were examined against AgNPs by 
      inhibitory concentration (IC-50 and IC-90) and minimum biofilm inhibitory
      concentration (MBIC- 90) methods. The regimens therapy was intra-vaginal
      inoculation of AgNPs at MBIC- 90 and a daily injection of 250 mg/kg LC for two
      weeks. Mice were classified into healthy (control) and AV groups and then treated
      by LC, AgNPs, and AgNPs + LC. The vaginal smears were taken daily and tissue
      sections were prepared using the hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) method. Results:
      Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of AgNPs for E. coli, S. aureus, and
      their mixture were 250, 125, and 500 ppm, and their MBIC-90% were 500, 250, and
      1000 ppm, respectively. The estrus cycle of mice treated with co-administration
      of AgNPs and LC was similar to the control group (P < 0.05). The results of
      histology also showed that infected mice were treated with AgNPs and LC,
      simultaneously. Conclusion: Single bacteria are more sensitive than their mixed
      model to these NPs. Co-administration of AgNPs as an antibacterial agent and LC
      as an antioxidant agent can treat AV in the infected mice.

TI  - Extracts of Sida cordifolia contain polysaccharides possessing immunomodulatory
      activity and rosmarinic acid compounds with antibacterial activity.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1186/s12906-022-03502-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The overuse of antibiotics has led to increased antimicrobial
      resistance, but plant-derived biological response modifiers represent a potential
      alternative to these drugs. This investigation examined the immunomodulatory and 
      antibacterial activities of Sida cordifolia (used in ethnomedicinal systems to
      treat infectious disease). METHODS: Successive extractions were performed from
      the roots of these plants in hexane, chloroform, methanol and water.
      Immunomodulatory activity was determined in a series of experiments measuring the
      responses of splenocytes, macrophages and an in vivo model of innate immunity
      (Galleria mellonella). Antibacterial activity was assessed by determining minimum
      inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations (MIC/MBCs) for various Gram-positive and
      Gram-negative bacterial strains. RESULTS: Immunomodulatory activity was confined 
      to the aqueous extract, and further fractionation and biochemical analysis
      yielded a highly potent polysaccharide-enriched fraction (SCAF5). SCAF5 is a
      complex mixture of different polysaccharides with multiple immunomodulatory
      effects including immune cell proliferation, antibody secretion, phagocytosis,
      nitric oxide production, and increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 
      Furthermore, Galleria mellonella pre-treated with SCAF5 produced more haemocytes 
      and were more resistant (P < 0.001) to infection with methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with a 98% reduction in bacterial load in
      pre-treated larvae compared to the negative control. The antibacterial activity
      of Sida cordifolia was confined to the methanolic fraction. Extensive
      fractionation identified two compounds, rosmarinic acid and its
      4-O-beta-d-glucoside derivative, which had potent activity against Gram-positive 
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including MRSA. CONCLUSIONS: Sida cordifolia
      counters bacterial infections through a dual mechanism, and immunomodulatory
      polysaccharides from this plant should be isolated and characterised to realise
      their potential as anti-infective agents. Such properties could be developed as
      an antibiotic alternative (1) in the clinic and (2) alternative growth promoter
      for the agri-food industry.

      against Cutibacterium acnes.

LID - 10.1093/jac/dkac014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cutibacterium acnes is one of the common multifactorial causes that
      play an important role in the pathophysiology of acne vulgaris. We aimed to
      develop novel antimicrobial peptides for reduction of the hypercolonization.
      METHODS: Six cationic peptides were derived by de novo designation. The
      antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of peptides were investigated. The peptide
      conformation was determined by circular dichroism spectrometry. The antimicrobial
      effects of peptides were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and DNA-binding ability assay. RESULTS:
      Among designed peptides, WSKK11 and WSRR11 were effective antimicrobials against 
      C. acnes at MICs of 128 and 64 mg/L, respectively. The MICs of WSKK11 against
      Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans were 8, 8 
      and 32 mg/L, while those of WSRR11 were 64, 32 and 32 mg/L, respectively. WSKK11 
      and WSRR11 were less toxic to human erythrocytes (<2%) and not toxic to
      macrophages, keratinocytes and fibroblasts up to 512 mg/L. WSKK11 and WSRR11
      mostly revealed the conformation of the undefined or random coil structures under
      mimicked environmental conditions. The peptides affected cell surfaces and cell
      membranes of C. acnes as well as possibly translocating through the cell
      membrane, observed by a combination of SEM and TEM, respectively. WSKK11 and
      WSRR11 had the ability to bind bacterial DNA. CONCLUSIONS: The two novel
      antimicrobial peptides WSKK11 and WSRR11 are members of a new class of
      antimicrobial agents that could deal with acne problems. Therefore, the
      antimicrobial peptides may be promising novel active agents for dermatological,
      beauty and cosmeceutical applications.

      impairment of macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, which is, however, inconsistent
      with low effectiveness of unopsonized Sa killing within macrophages and redundant
      roles of both receptors in this process. We have found that Sa-stimulated
      cytokine production in mouse macrophages seems to be exclusively mediated by
      TLR2, mainly from within endosomes in response to Sa-derived lipoteichoic acid.
      By driving endocytic trafficking of TLR2 and its ligands through the
      clathrin-dependent pathway, CD36 and SR-A sensitize macrophages to activation by 
      Sa as well as regulate the type and amount of cytokines produced. Additionally,
      upon direct Sa binding, both receptors autonomously generate anti-inflammatory
      signaling. Consequently, the delayed induction of acute inflammation in knockout 
      mice may allow for the initial, uncontrolled multiplication of bacteria,
      stimulating excessive, septic shock-inducing production of inflammatory cytokines
      in later stages of infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Over the past decade, daptomycin treatment of methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections has led to the emergence of daptomycin
      non-susceptible (DAP-NS) MRSA strains and a subsequent interest in combinatorial 
      antibiotic therapies. We investigated the phenotypic and genetic changes
      associated with the seesaw effect, which describes the correlation between
      daptomycin resistance and increased beta-lactam susceptibility in DAP-NS MRSA and
      the reverse phenomenon of DAP-NS strains acquiring renewed susceptibility to
      daptomycin after beta-lactam exposure. METHODS: A continuous bioreactor model was
      used to study the effects of incremental doses of daptomycin followed by
      oxacillin on MRSA strain N315. MICs for daptomycin and oxacillin were determined 
      for the bioreactor-derived samples. Transmission electron microscopy and
      cytochrome C binding assays were used to measure cell wall thickness and cell
      membrane charge, respectively, in the bioreactor-derived samples. Whole-genome
      sequencing was used to identify mutations associated with seesaw effect. RESULTS:
      While daptomycin resistance conferred enhanced susceptibility to oxacillin,
      oxacillin treatment of DAP-NS strains was accompanied by a lowered MIC for
      daptomycin. Additionally, there was a reduction in relative positive cell surface
      charge and cell wall thickness. However, the mutations acquired in our DAP-NS
      populations were not accompanied by additional genomic changes after treatment
      with oxacillin, implicating alternative mechanisms for the seesaw effect.
      CONCLUSION: In this study, we successfully produced and characterized the seesaw 
      effect in MRSA strain N315 in a unique bioreactor model.

LID - 10.1016/j.ajic.2022.01.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hand drying is one of the most important factors affect hand hygiene.
      This study was conducted to investigate the effect of hand dryers used in the
      restrooms located on the food court floors in shopping malls in Turkey on hand
      hygiene. METHODS: Hands were washed for at least 20 seconds by following hygienic
      hand washing procedures of the World Health Organization. Swab samples were taken
      from the wet hands after hand washing, then from the dry hands, which were dried 
      under the hand dryers and from the air blowing part of the hand dryers. Samples
      were cultured on agar plates that were directly exposed to the air-blowing part
      of the hand dryers. RESULTS: It was found that total coliform bacteria (CCC) were
      0.000 CFU/petri in wet and dried hand, 3.437 CFU/petri in blown air and 5.250
      CFU/petri in swab samples. Staphylococcus aureus was found to be 0.125, 64.125,
      26.375 and 388.750 CFU/petri, respectively. Total bacteria count was found to be 
      0.687, 48.750, 35.625 and 595.000 CFU/petri, respectively. S. aureus and the
      total bacterial load were higher in the blower outlet of the hand dryers than
      washed hand, blown air and dried hand (p<0.05). The bacteria count in the
      unfiltered hand dryers was higher than that in the filtered hand dryers (p<0.05).
      CONCLUSION: Using hand dryers would negatively affect hand hygiene even if hands 
      were washed following hygienic hand washing procedures.

      Care and Prevention of Surgical Site Infections by Cutibacterium acnes and
      Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
LID - 10.1089/sur.2021.237 [doi]
AB  - Background: This study presents the effectiveness of a combined silver
      carboxylate (AgCar) and chlorohexidine gluconate (AgCar:CHG) chemistry assessed
      against two commonly encountered nosocomial pathogens, Methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Cutibacterium acnes, within the context of
      surgical antisepsis and wound care. Methods: Through an Institutional Review
      Board- and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)-approved protocol,
      AgCar:CHG was applied to live Yucatan porcine skin and visualized by fast red and
      green staining to assess level of skin penetration. Dose response curves for
      Cutibacterium acnes and MRSA were generated to determine the optimal therapeutic 
      ratio of AgCar to CHG. Coatings were applied to two different clinically
      available sutures and antimicrobial efficacy was evaluated at 24-hour intervals
      using Kirby-Bauer (KB) assays. Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy
      was used to measure AgCar elution from sutures over time. Results: Synergistic
      application of AgCar:CHG demonstrated deep pilosebaceous gland penetration on
      Yucatan pig skin. The therapeutic concentration range of AgCar was determined to 
      be between 120 x -150 x and 30 x -60 x dopage for MRSA and Cutibacterium acnes,
      respectively. A 1:1 therapeutic ratio of AgCar to CHG was found to have 100%
      bactericidal activity against both pathogens. Sutures coated with AgCar:CHG
      showed sustained antimicrobial activity against MRSA and Cutibacterium acnes, and
      were significantly more efficacious than antimicrobial sutures over the three- to
      four-day period (p < 0.01). Conclusions: This AgCar:CHG chemistry demonstrates
      deep skin penetration, extended elution, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial
      activity compared with commercially available options. This chemistry shows
      promise as an additional tool for the prophylaxis of surgical site infections.

AB  - Surgical site infections (SSIs) frequently involve resident bacteria (eg,
      Staphylococcus aureus) on the patient's skin. Strategies to help prevent SSIs
      include removing soil and transient microorganisms from the skin before surgery. 
      Preoperative decolonization, preoperative bathing, and application of an
      effective skin antiseptic at the surgical site are components of a multimodal
      approach to reducing microorganisms to subpathogenic levels. As members of an
      interdisciplinary team, perioperative RNs are essential in the development and
      implementation of SSI prevention bundles to promote patient safety. This article 
      discusses recommendations from the AORN "Guideline for preoperative patient skin 
      antisepsis" for decolonization protocols, preoperative bathing, and selection of 
      surgical site antiseptics. A scenario describes the process a facility team uses 
      to determine components of an SSI prevention bundle after recognizing an increase
      in infections from multidrug-resistant organisms.

      Bacillus velezensis SK.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/s13568-022-01348-3 [doi]
AB  - Bacillus velezensis SK having broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity has been
      isolated from soil. The efficient extraction of antimicrobial compounds produced 
      in various mediums has been done using Diaion HP-20 resin. Further,
      characterization of an antimicrobial compound by TLC, FTIR, in-situ bioautography
      analysis revealed the presence of cyclic lipopeptides, which is then purified by 
      the combination of silica gel, size exclusion, dual gradient, and RP-HPLC
      chromatography techniques. Growth kinetic studies showed that Bacillus velezensis
      SK produces a mixture of lipopeptides (1.33 gL(-1)). The lipopeptide exhibits
      good pH (2-10) and temperature stability up to 80 degrees C. LC-ESI-MS analysis
      of partially purified lipopeptide identified variant of surfactin, further
      analysis of purified chromatographic fractions revealed the occurrence of most
      abundant C15-surfactin homologues (m/z 1036.72 Da). The isolated surfactin
      exhibits good antimicrobial activity (1600 AU/ml) against drug-resistant
      food-born B. cereus and human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Hence, identified
      strain B. velezensis SK and its potent antibacterial surfactin lipopeptide could 
      be used in various food and biomedical applications.

TI  - Stem Region of tRNA Genes Favors Transition Substitution Towards Keto Bases in
      Bacteria.
PG  - 114-123
LID - 10.1007/s00239-021-10045-x [doi]
AB  - Transversion and transition mutations have variable effects on the stability of
      RNA secondary structure considering that the former destabilizes the double helix
      geometry to a greater extent by introducing purine:purine (R:R) or
      pyrimidine:pyrimidine (Y:Y) base pairs. Therefore, transversion frequency is
      likely to be lower than that of transition in the secondary structure regions of 
      RNA genes. Here, we performed an analysis of transition and transversion
      frequencies in tRNA genes defined well with secondary structure and compared with
      the intergenic regions in five bacterial species namely Escherichia coli,
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus and
      Streptococcus pneumoniae using a large genome sequence data set. In general, the 
      transversion frequency was observed to be lower than that of transition in both
      tRNA genes and intergenic regions. The transition to transversion ratio was
      observed to be greater in tRNA genes than that in the intergenic regions in all
      the five bacteria that we studied. Interestingly, the intraspecies base
      substitution analysis in tRNA genes revealed that non-compensatory substitutions 
      were more frequent than compensatory substitutions in the stem region. Further,
      transition to transversion ratio in the loop region was observed to be
      significantly lesser than that among the non-compensatory substitutions in the
      stem region. This indicated that the transversion is more deleterious than
      transition in the stem regions. In addition, substitutions from amino bases (A/C)
      to keto bases (G/T) were also observed to be more than the reverse substitutions 
      in the stem region. Substitution from amino bases to keto bases are likely to
      facilitate the stable G:U pairing unlike the reverse substitution that
      facilitates the unstable A:C pairing in the stem region of tRNA. This work
      provides additional support that the secondary structure of tRNA molecule is what
      drives the different substitutions in its gene sequence.

LID - 10.1007/s00105-021-04937-8 [doi]
AB  - Acute skin and soft tissue infections are among the most frequent infections in
      medicine. There is a broad spectrum including simple local infections as well as 
      severe and life-threatening diseases. Along with Staphylococcus aureus, group A
      Streptococci are mainly responsible for these illnesses. The therapeutic approach
      ranges from antiseptic local treatments to administering systemic antibiotics or 
      emergency surgery. Treating physicians often face challenges when presented with 
      soft tissue infections due to a great discrepancy between the first impression of
      the disease compared to a possibly quick progression as well as the wide range of
      sometimes confusing historic terms and definitions being used in the English and 
      German language, for instance pyoderma, erysipelas or phlegmon. A recently more
      popular collective term emphasized by clinical trials is "acute bacterial skin
      and skin structure infections" (ABSSSI).

TI  - Changes in resistance pattern of ESKAPE pathogens between 2010 and 2020 in the
      clinical center of University of Szeged, Hungary.
LID - 10.1556/030.2022.01640 [doi]
AB  - The acronym ESKAPE stands for six antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens
      namely, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
      Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. Monitoring
      their resistance is an important task for clinical microbiology laboratories. Our
      aim was to analyze the resistance patterns of these bacteria over ten years in
      clinical samples of our department. We examined the sample types from which these
      pathogens were most frequently isolated. The incidence of tests with resistant
      results for each pathogen in aggregate and the most important subgroups of each
      was also analyzed. We have also intended to predict the local priorities amongst 
      these pathogens. The results of 1,268,126 antibiotic susceptibility tests
      performed on a total of 70,099 isolates over this period were examined. Most
      strains were derived from urine, blood culture, trachea, vagina, wounds, and
      abscesses. Prevalence of ESKAPE bacteria increased between 2011 and 2020 however,
      the steepest intensifications were seen in the cases of K. pneumoniae and P.
      aeruginosa. The number of antibiotic susceptibility tests with resistant results 
      has also increased over the decade but the most notable increase was detected in 
      E. faecium and A. baumannii. Based on the calculation of antimicrobial resistance
      index for each pathogen, the most serious challenges for us at present are A.
      baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and E. faecium and their multi-resistant forms. The
      theoretical prediction of proportion of resistant tests between 2020 and 2030 in 
      our care area draws attention to a worrying trend in the cases of
      vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains.

TI  - Modulation of CD36-mediated lipid accumulation and senescence by vitamin E
      analogs in monocytes and macrophages.
LID - 10.1002/biof.1821 [doi]
AB  - The CD36/FAT scavenger receptor/fatty acids transporter regulates cellular lipid 
      accumulation important for inflammation, atherosclerosis, lipotoxicity, and
      initiation of cellular senescence. Here we compared the regulatory effects of the
      vitamin E analogs alpha-tocopherol (alphaT), alpha-tocopheryl phosphate
      (alphaTP), and alphaTP/betaCD (a nanocarrier complex between alphaTP and
      beta-cyclodextrin [betaCD]) and investigated their regulatory effects on lipid
      accumulation, phagocytosis, and senescence in THP-1 monocytes and macrophages.
      Both, alphaTP and alphaTP/betaCD inhibited CD36 surface exposition stronger than 
      alphaT leading to more pronounced CD36-mediated events such as inhibition of
      DiI-labeled oxLDL uptake, phagocytosis of fluorescent Staphylococcus aureus
      bioparticles, and cell proliferation. When compared to betaCD, the complex of
      alphaTP/betaCD extracted cholesterol from cellular membranes with higher
      efficiency and was associated with the delivery of alphaTP to the cells.
      Interestingly, both, alphaTP and more so alphaTP/betaCD inhibited lysosomal
      senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) activity and increased
      lysosomal pH, suggesting CD36-mediated uptake into the endo-lysosomal phagocytic 
      compartment. Accordingly, the observed pH increase was more pronounced with
      alphaTP/betaCD in macrophages whereas no significant increase occurred with
      alphaT, alpha-tocopheryl acetate (alphaTA) or betaCD. In contrast to alphaT and
      alphaTA, the alphaTP molecule is di-anionic at neutral pH, but upon moving into
      the acidic endo-lysosomal compartment becomes protonated and thus is acting as a 
      base. Moreover, it is expected to be retained in lysosomes since it still carries
      one negative charge, similar to lysosomotropic drugs. Thus, treatment with
      alphaTP or alphaTP/betaCD and/or inhibition of conversion of alphaTP to alphaT as
      it occurs in aged cells may counteract CD36-mediated overlapping inflammatory,
      senescent, and atherosclerotic events.

TI  - Rifampicin-induced fever during treatment against staphylococcal biofilm in a
      patient with periprosthetic joint infection.
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15248 [doi]
AB  - Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total knee arthroplasty remains a
      challenging complication. The treatment options for PJI include different
      procedures; however, regardless of the strategy, antibiotics are required. The
      combination of different antibiotics increased the rates of PJI eradication. For 
      almost 3 decades, rifampicin has been used as part of antibiotic therapy for PJI.
      Drug fever, a febrile response that coincides with the onset of drug
      administration and disappears after drug discontinuation in the absence of other 
      underlying conditions that could cause fever, is frequently misdiagnosed. We
      present the case of a 72-year-old man with PJI 6 months after total knee
      arthroplasty. Two-stage revision surgery was followed by culture-directed
      antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin and rifampicin) against Staphylococcus aureus
      isolated from the periprosthetic tissue. On the fifth day of antibiotic
      treatment, the patient became febrile and, in the next 5 days, he had an
      intermittent fever of up to 40 degrees C, although he showed clinical
      improvement. The patient was normotensive without a maculopapular rash, urticaria
      or clotting abnormalities. A drug fever was suspected, and rifampicin was
      discontinued. A re-challenge test was performed, and the fever recurred.
      Antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin was continued and, after 12 months of
      follow-up, the patient was doing well. Clinicians should be aware that fever
      could be a clinical presentation of drug fever. If it occurs during an infection,
      drug fever could necessitate additional diagnostic procedures for further
      evaluation, inadequate antibiotic therapy and prolonged hospitalisation.

      Broad-Spectrum and Efficient Antibacterial Activity.
PG  - e202104174
LID - 10.1002/chem.202104174 [doi]
AB  - Carbon dots (CDs) have recently emerged as antibacterial agents and have
      attracted considerable attention owing to their fascinating merits of small size,
      facile fabrication, and surface functionalization. Most of them are involved in
      external light activation or hybridization with other functional nanomaterials.
      Herein, we present peroxidase-like Cu-doped CDs (Cu-CDs) for in vitro
      antibacterial applications. The unique peroxidase-mimicking property of the
      Cu-CDs was demonstrated by tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic assay, electron
      paramagnetic resonance spectra, and hydroxy radical probe. Escherichia coli and
      Staphylococcus aureus were chosen as representative gram-negative/positive models
      against which Cu-CDs exhibited superior antimicrobial activity even at a dosage
      down to 5 mug/mL. A possible mechanism of action was that the Cu-CDs triggered a 
      catalytic redox reaction of endogenous H2 O2 and glutathione depletion in the
      bacteria cells, with subsequent oxidative stress and membrane disruption. This
      work provides a new strategy for the design of microenvironment-responsive
      antimicrobial nano-agents.

AB  - We present the case of a middle-aged man who developed infective endocarditis of 
      the tricuspid valve caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and
      associated with very large vegetation ( approximately 5 cm). Besides the quite
      unusual size of the vegetation, this report highlights that severe right-sided
      endocarditis can occur in the absence of classical risk factors (intravenous drug
      abuse, presence of a cardiac implantable electronic device or other intravascular
      devices, and underlying right-sided cardiac anomaly) and that some cases of
      severe tricuspid endocarditis can be successfully treated by partial excision and
      patch repair.

PG  - 810142
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2021.810142 [doi]
AB  - Animal farming has intensified significantly in recent decades, with the
      emergence of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in industrialized
      nations. The congregation of susceptible animals in CAFOs can lead to heavy
      environmental contamination with pathogens, promoting the emergence of
      hyper-transmissible, and virulent pathogens. As a result, CAFOs have been
      associated with emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, hepatitis
      E virus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Streptococcus suis, livestock-associated
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Cryptosporidium parvum in farm
      animals. This has led to increased transmission of zoonotic pathogens in humans
      and changes in disease patterns in general communities. They are exemplified by
      the common occurrence of outbreaks of illnesses through direct and indirect
      contact with farm animals, and wide occurrence of similar serotypes or subtypes
      in both humans and farm animals in industrialized nations. Therefore, control
      measures should be developed to slow down the dispersal of zoonotic pathogens
      associated with CAFOs and prevent the emergence of new pathogens of epidemic and 
      pandemic potential.

TI  - Routine intraoperative microbiological smear testing in patients with reoperation
      after elective degenerative non-instrumented spine surgery-useful or negligible
      adjunct.
LID - 10.1007/s00701-022-05132-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Surgical site infections (SSI) are a rare but dreaded cause for
      recurrent symptomatology requiring reoperation after degenerative spine surgery. 
      We here aim to elucidate if routine microbiological smear testing during
      reoperation might be a useful tool for subsequent patient management. METHODS: We
      investigated clinical, laboratory/imaging characteristics, and outcome of
      patients undergoing reoperation in the previously affected segment during
      follow-up after elective degenerative non-instrumented spine surgery.
      Microbiological cultures via multiple intraoperative smear tests of the
      superficial/deep wound layers were routinely performed and correlated with
      clinical/imaging/laboratory/surgical signs for SSI and outcome. RESULTS: From
      altogether 2552 patients with degenerative spine surgery in 2014-2019, a total of
      62 patients (m:f = 1.6:1, median 69 years) underwent same-level reoperation due
      to recurrent symptomatology (mean -time:17 +/- 36 months) with a predominance of 
      the lumbar spine (90%). In 9 patients with imaging/laboratory suspicious for SSI,
      microbiological culturing of intraoperative smear testing revealed conclusive
      pathogen growth in 89% (100% with additional PCR analysis); the predominant
      pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus with detection mainly in the deep wound
      layers. In contrast, in 53 patients without
      clinical/imaging/laboratory/intraoperative signs for SSI microbiological
      culturing showed minor pathogen growth in 15% displaying bacterial
      colonization/contamination of the surgical site. The predominant pathogens in
      this cohort were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Cutibacterium acnes, and these
      patients had favorable outcomes when monitored with close surveillance without
      anti-infective treatment. CONCLUSION: Bacterial colonization/contamination occurs
      in 15% of patients without signs of infection undergoing same-level reoperation
      after degenerative spine surgery. These patients can be managed with close
      surveillance without antibiotic treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical profile and treatment outcomes of infective
      endocarditis (IE) at a tertiary hospital in KwaZulu-Natal. METHODS: A 10-year
      retrospective analysis was conducted on cases of definite IE (modified Duke
      criteria). RESULTS: Ninety-seven subjects (HIV infected, n = 12) satisfied the
      study criteria (mean age 29.7 +/- 15.6 years, M:F 1.4:1). Underlying rheumatic
      heart disease was present in 84.5% and severe dyspnoea in 67.0% of cases.
      Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest pathogen isolated (18.6%). Heart failure 
      was present in 61.9% and vegetations were identified in 85 (87.6%) subjects,
      resulting in 41 (42.3%) embolic events. The clinical profile and outcomes were
      similar in the HIV-positive and -negative patients. Surgery was performed in 73
      subjects (surgical mortality rate 9.5%, total mortality rate 26.4%). Multivariate
      analysis identified acute-onset IE [odds ratio (OR) 251.46, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 1.18-5343.63, p = 0.043], vegetation size > 15 mm (OR 222.60, 95%
      CI 1.04-4730.34, p = 0.043) and medical management only (OR 20.89, 95% CI
      2.12-200.06, p = 0.037) as predictors for increased in-hospital mortality.
      CONCLUSION: IE affects young people with underlying rheumatic heart disease and
      is associated with high morbi-mortality attributable to advanced disease at
      presentation and to haemodynamic failure resulting from valve destruction due to 
      acute onset of aggressive infection.

TI  - Magnetic Responsive Release of Nitric Oxide from an MOF-Derived Fe3O4@PLGA
      Microsphere for the Treatment of Bacteria-Infected Cutaneous Wound.
PG  - 6343-6357
LID - 10.1021/acsami.1c20802 [doi]
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is an essential endogenous signaling molecule regulating
      multifaceted physiological functions in the (cardio)vascular, neuronal, and
      immune systems. Due to the short half-life and location-/concentration-dependent 
      physiological function of NO, translational application of NO as a novel
      therapeutic approach, however, awaits a strategy for spatiotemporal control on
      the delivery of NO. Inspired by the magnetic hyperthermia and magneto-triggered
      drug release featured by Fe3O4 conjugates, in this study, we aim to develop a
      magnetic responsive NO-release material (MagNORM) featuring dual NO-release
      phases, namely, burst and steady release, for the selective activation of
      NO-related physiology and treatment of bacteria-infected cutaneous wound. After
      conjugation of NO-delivery [Fe(mu-S-thioglycerol)(NO)2]2 with a metal-organic
      framework (MOF)-derived porous Fe3O4@C, encapsulation of obtained conjugates
      within the thermo-responsive poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microsphere
      completes the assembly of MagNORM. Through continuous/pulsatile/no application of
      the alternating magnetic field (AMF) to MagNORM, moreover,
      burst/intermittent/slow release of NO from MagNORM demonstrates the AMF as an
      ON/OFF switch for temporal control on the delivery of NO. Under continuous
      application of the AMF, in particular, burst release of NO from MagNORM triggers 
      an effective anti-bacterial activity against both Gram-positive Staphylococcus
      aureus (S. aureus) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli). In addition to
      the magneto-triggered bactericidal effect of MagNORM against E. coli-infected
      cutaneous wound in mice, of importance, steady release of NO from MagNORM without
      the AMF promotes the subsequent collagen formation and wound healing in mice.

TI  - Exposure to aerosolized staphylococcal enterotoxin B potentiated by
      lipopolysaccharide modifies lung transcriptomes and results in lung injury in the
      mouse model.
LID - 10.1002/jat.4289 [doi]
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the main constituents of the cell wall in
      Gram-negative bacteria. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is produced by the
      Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. Emerging evidence
      suggests that intraperitoneal injection of LPS combined with low-dose aerosolized
      SEB exposure can cause severe lung injury and even death, while SEB or LPS alone 
      cause neither mortality nor severe pulmonary symptoms in mice. However, pulmonary
      effects from exposure to aerosolized SEB potentiated by LPS have not been
      evaluated. This study investigates the global transcriptome profile of lung
      tissue in mice after exposure to aerosolized SEB potentiated by LPS or LPS alone.
      A mouse model of intratracheal exposure to LPS-potentiated aerosolized SEB is
      established and described through histological examination. Transcriptome
      analysis revealed LPS-potentiated aerosolized SEB affected mouse lungs within 72 
      h post-SEB inhalation, gradually causing lung injury starting from 24 h post
      inhalation. Hub genes leading to lung injury at 48 h post inhalation have been
      identified. Flow cytometry revealed that LPS potentiation of low-dose SEB
      produces a superantigen response that T cells expressing a particular T cell
      receptor Vbeta induces a proliferation response by 72 h post inhalation in the
      lungs of mice. This study represents the first research to investigate pulmonary 
      transcriptional responses of LPS-potentiated aerosolized low-dose SEB exposure.
      This research helps to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the process 
      by which the two bacterial components combined to produce lung damage and
      provides an insight into potential treatments for alleviating inflammation of the
      lung when coinfection is present.

LID - 10.1016/j.idcr.2022.e01398 [doi]
AB  - Vancomycin is used for the treatment of gram-positive infections. The increasing 
      prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus since the 1980 s has
      led to a significant increase in the clinical utility of vancomycin in the United
      States. The diagnosis of vancomycin induced thrombocytopenia (VIT) poses a
      challenge since it requires the exclusion of other etiologies of
      thrombocytopenia, such as infectious or immunologic diseases and alternative
      drugs. Physicians should be aware that VIT is a rare but important complication
      of IV vancomycin therapy and failure to recognize this diagnosis may lead to a
      delay in discontinuation of vancomycin and serious complications.

TI  - Anticoagulated de novo atrial flutter complicated by transitory ischemic attack
      in fatal COVID-19.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 may not only manifest as pneumonia (COVID-19) but also in other
      organs, including the brain (neuro-COVID). One of the cerebral complications of
      SARS-CoV-2 is ischemic stroke. Transitory ischemic attack (TIA) in a SARS-CoV-2
      positive has not been reported. A 78-year-old poly-morbid male (diabetes,
      hypertension, and coronary heart disease), admitted for COVID-19, developed
      atrial flutter on hospital day (hd) 2. Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was
      started. On hd5, he experienced a TIA despite sufficient anticoagulation. The
      patient expired on hd28 due to multi-organ failure from sepsis due to
      superinfection with staphylococcus aureus. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may be
      complicated by atrial flutter. Atrial flutter may be complicated by TIA despite
      sufficient anticoagulation, suggesting that standard anticoagulation may be
      insufficient to meet SARS-CoV-2-associated hypercoagulability syndrome. Forced
      anticoagulation and adequate antibiosis in poly-morbid SARS-CoV-2-infected
      patients with hypercoagulability and cytokine storm are warranted.

TI  - Interactions between human milk oligosaccharides, microbiota and immune factors
      in milk of women with and without mastitis.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-05250-7 [doi]
AB  - Lactational mastitis is an excellent target to study possible interactions
      between HMOs, immune factors and milk microbiota due to the infectious and
      inflammatory nature of this condition. In this work, microbiological,
      immunological and HMO profiles of milk samples from women with (MW) or without
      (HW) mastitis were compared. Secretor status in women (based on HMO profile) was 
      not associated to mastitis. DFLNH, LNFP II and LSTb concentrations in milk were
      higher in samples from HW than from MW among Secretor women. Milk from HW was
      characterized by a low bacterial load (dominated by Staphylococcus epidermidis
      and streptococci), high prevalence of IL10 and IL13, and low sialylated HMO
      concentration. In contrast, high levels of staphylococci, streptococci, IFNgamma 
      and IL12 characterized milk from MW. A comparison between subacute (SAM) and
      acute (AM) mastitis cases revealed differences related to the etiological agent
      (S. epidermidis in SAM; Staphylococcus aureus in AM), milk immunological profile 
      (high content of IL10 and IL13 in SAM and IL2 in AM) and milk HMOs profile (high 
      content of 3FL in SAM and of LNT, LNnT, and LSTc in AM). These results suggest
      that microbiological, immunological and HMOs profiles of milk are related to
      mammary health of women.

AB  - The formation of ordered cross-beta amyloid protein aggregates is associated with
      a variety of human disorders. While conventional infrared methods serve as
      sensitive reporters of the presence of these amyloids, the recently discovered
      amyloid secondary structure of cross-alpha fibrils presents new questions and
      challenges. Herein, we report results using Fourier transform infrared
      spectroscopy and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to monitor the aggregation
      of one such cross-alpha-forming peptide, phenol soluble modulin alpha 3
      (PSMalpha3). Phenol soluble modulins (PSMs) are involved in the formation and
      stabilization of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, making sensitive methods of
      detecting and characterizing these fibrils a pressing need. Our experimental data
      coupled with spectroscopic simulations reveals the simultaneous presence of
      cross-alpha and cross-beta polymorphs within samples of PSMalpha3 fibrils. We
      also report a new spectroscopic feature indicative of cross-alpha fibrils.

TI  - [Advances in the mechanism of bacterial escape neutrophil killing].
PG  - 89-94
AB  - The innate immune system is the forefront defense against bacterial invasion in
      human body. Neutrophils, as major immune cells, can capture and phagocytose
      bacteria, which are indispensable for maintaining the health of the body.
      Pathogens such as Streptococcus, Neisseria meningitidis, Klebsiella, Escherichia 
      coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis have evolved multiple mechanisms to circumvent killing
      by neutrophils outside and inside the cells, even taking cells as their survival 
      and breeding sites. These mechanisms include interfering with neutral granulocyte
      collection and phagocytosis, degrading neutrophil extracellular traps, inhibiting
      the production of reactive oxygen and antimicrobial peptides, and manipulating
      the life-span and death of cells.

TI  - Internal teat sealants alone or in combination with antibiotics at dry-off - the 
      effect on udder health in dairy cows in five commercial herds.

AB  - In the dairy industry, the dry period has been identified as an area for
      potential reduction in antibiotic use, as part of a one health approach to
      preserve antibiotic medicines for human health. The objective of this study was
      to assess the impact of dry cow treatment on somatic cell count (SCC),
      intramammary infection (IMI) and milk yield on five commercial Irish dairy herds.
      A total of 842 cows across five spring calving dairy herds with a monthly bulk
      tank SCC of < 200 000 cells/mL were recruited for this study. At dry-off, cows
      which had not exceeded 200 000 cells/mL in the previous lactation were assigned
      one of two dry-off treatments: internal teat seal (ITS) alone (Lo_TS) or
      antibiotic plus ITS (Lo_AB + TS). Cows which exceeded 200 000 cells/mL in the
      previous lactation were treated with antibiotic plus ITS and included in the
      analysis as a separate group (Hi_AB + TS). Test-day SCC and lactation milk yield 
      records were provided by the herd owners. Quarter milk samples were collected at 
      dry-off, after calving and at mid-lactation for bacteriological culture and
      quarter SCC analysis. Cow level SCC was available for 789 cows and was
      log-transformed for the purpose of analysis. Overall, the log SCC of the cows in 
      the Lo_TS group was significantly higher than the cows in Lo_AB + TS group and
      not statistically different to the cows in the Hi_AB + TS group in the subsequent
      lactation. However, the response to treatment differed according to the herd
      studied; the log SCC of the cows in the Lo_TS group in Herds 3, 4 and 5 was not
      statistically different to the cows in Lo_AB + TS group, whereas in the other two
      herds, the log SCC was significantly higher in the Lo_TS when compared to the
      Lo_AB + TS group. There was a significant interaction between dry-off group and
      herds on SCC and odds of infection in the subsequent lactation. The results of
      this study suggest that the herd prevalence of IMI may be useful in
      decision-making regarding the treatment of cows with ITS alone at dry-off to
      mitigate its impact on udder health.

AB  - Synergistic antibacterial effect is a promising way to overcome the challenge of 
      microbial contamination in food. In this study, we detected the synergistic
      interactions of nisin and carvacrol. The MIC of nisin and carvacrol against S.
      aureus were 60 and 125 mug/mL, respectively. The FICI and FBCI were 0.28125 and
      0.09375, which suggested that the nisin/carvacrol combination presented
      synergistic antibacterial effect against S. aureus. The antibacterial activity of
      nisin/carvacrol combination was much higher than their individuals and the dose
      of antibacterials was obviously reduced. The combination could completely kill S.
      aureus within 8 h, accelerate the destruction of cell membrane, and inhibit
      formation of biofilm. Under the intervention of nisin, more CAR could enter cell 
      to hunt intracellular targets, leading to an increase in intracellular
      antibacterial level. Besides, in the storage of pasteurized milk, the
      combinational treatment successfully inhibited microbial reproduction at 25
      degrees C and 4 degrees C. Thus, the combination of nisin and carvacrol was a
      potential synergistic strategy for food preservation.

TI  - Effects of infectious disease consultation and antimicrobial stewardship program 
      at a Japanese cancer center: An interrupted time-series analysis.
PG  - e0263095
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0263095 [doi]
AB  - In cancer patients, appropriate diagnosis and management of infection are
      frequently challenging owing to subtle or atypical presentation. We investigated 
      the effectiveness of infectious disease (ID) consultations and the Antimicrobial 
      Stewardship Program (ASP) in a Japanese cancer center. This 36-month-period,
      single-institution, interrupted time series analysis was retrospectively
      conducted during April 1, 2018-March 31, 2021, to evaluate a two-phase
      intervention: Phase 1 (notification of antimicrobials by the infection control
      team) and Phase 2 (establishing an ID consultation service and implementing ASP).
      Among 32,202 patients hospitalized, 22,096 and 10,106 hospitalizations occurred
      at baseline and during intervention period, respectively. The Antimicrobial
      Stewardship Team (AST) provided feedback on specific broad-spectrum
      antimicrobials in 913 instances (347 appropriate [38%]; 566 inappropriate [62%]),
      and 440 ID consultations were completed, with a 75% overall acceptance rate for
      AST suggestions. In Phase 2, monthly carbapenem days of therapy (CAR-DOT)
      decreased significantly, and narrow-spectrum antibiotic usage increased
      significantly in both trend and level; monthly DOT of antipseudomonal agents
      decreased significantly in trend. The results of these analyses of antimicrobial 
      use are consistent with the DOT-based data based on antimicrobial use density
      (AUD). The total number of inpatient specimens increased significantly; the trend
      of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus infections decreased, without changes in the incidence of
      other resistant organisms, all-cause in-hospital mortality, and length of stay.
      Actual and adjusted CAR purchase costs per patient-day decreased without
      significant changes in the actual and adjusted purchase cost per patient-day for 
      all intravenous antimicrobials. Combining ID consultation and ASP reduced
      carbapenem use without negative patient outcomes. Their implementation could
      facilitate establishment of safe cancer treatment facilities in Japan and improve
      prognosis in cancer patients.

TI  - Microencapsulated sodium fusidate to impart antibacterial properties into cotton 
      dressings for traumatic wounds.

AB  - This research aimed to investigate the use of microencapsulated sodium fusidate
      to impart antibacterial properties into conventional cotton gauze used to treat
      traumatic wounds. The microcapsules were prepared with sodium fusidate dissolved 
      in ethanol as the active substance (core) and calcium alginate as the wall
      material (shell) using an electrospraying method. The microcapsules were then
      loaded into a 1% solution of chitosan, and conventional sterile cotton gauze
      fabric was impregnated in this suspension and dried at room temperature. The
      microcapsules obtained were examined with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
      to confirm the constituents, and by scanning electron microscopy to examine the
      size and distribution of the microcapsules. The results showed that microcapsules
      with sodium fusidate as the core material were produced in a size range of
      50-200microm. The antibacterial properties of these gauze samples were tested for
      resistance to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The samples showed
      antibacterial properties against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus)
      only, with an average inhibition zone of 31.67+/-2.89mm in diameter. The
      antibacterial effect of the treated gauze samples was tested after washing to
      investigate the strength of the binding agent, to find out whether the samples
      maintained antibacterial properties after two hand-rubbed washes. Its absorption 
      capacity, rate of absorbency and air permeability values were 555+/-4.51%,
      1.25+/-0.04 seconds and 408+/-2.65cm(3)/cm(2)/seconds, respectively. The research
      findings have established the possibility of imparting antibacterial properties
      into sterile cotton gauze using microencapsulation of sodium fusidate.

TI  - Fabrication of a Lignin-Copper Sulfide-Incorporated PVA Hydrogel with
      Near-Infrared-Activated Photothermal/Photodynamic/Peroxidase-like Performance for
      Combating Bacteria and Biofilms.
LID - 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c01406 [doi]
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria and biofilms are among the most difficult
      challenges in infection treatment. Herein, lignin-copper sulfide (LS-CuS)
      nanocomposites were incorporated into a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel to
      fabricate a LS-CuS@PVA composite hydrogel with near-infrared-activated
      photothermal, photodynamic, and peroxidase-like performance. The antibacterial
      tests of LS-CuS@PVA exhibited the highest antibacterial rate that caused 3.8-log 
      and 4.8-log reductions of colony forming units (CFUs) against Escherichia coli
      and Staphylococcus aureus in the presence of H2O2 under near-infrared (NIR) light
      irradiation for 10 min. The significantly improved bactericidal performance could
      be attributed to the synergistic effects of hyperthermia and reactive oxygen
      species (ROS). Furthermore, the LS-CuS@PVA hydrogel could eradicate the already
      formed biofilm and inhibit biofilm formation. Considering the highly effective
      antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of the LS-CuS@PVA hydrogel, this work
      could provide new insights for the design of poly(vinyl alcohol)-based composite 
      hydrogels for wound healing and wound dressing.

TI  - Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococci (MRS): Carriage and Antibiotic Resistance
      Patterns in College Students.
LID - 10.1007/s10900-022-01065-9 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococci (MRS) may allow for 
      the unseen dissemination of antibiotic-resistant strains through the population. 
      This study investigates the prevalence and epidemiological risk factors that
      contribute to the spread of MRS in a university setting in Amman, Jordan. A
      cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was performed in December 2019. Five
      hundred and four students enrolled in the study and provided skin and nasal
      swabs. Swabs were then processed to isolate MRS on Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA) + 4
      microg/ml oxacillin. Isolates were tested for their antibiotic susceptibility
      using the disc diffusion assay. Epidemiological risk assessment was performed
      using the Chi-square test and univariate and multivariant analysis. The
      percentage carriage of MRS in the 504 students was 40.4%. The carriage rate of
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) from the skin and nasal areas was 13.5% and
      26.9%, respectively. The percentage of male carriers was significantly higher
      than females, and the only identified epidemiological risk factor related to the 
      carriage was attendance at a fitness club. All MRS isolates were resistant to
      oxacillin (100%), cefoxitin (45.5%), erythromycin (35.2%), gentamycin (10.2%),
      ciprofloxacin (12.7%), nitrofurantoin (12.2%), linezolid (7.8%), amikacin
      (1.47%), and Vancomycin (0.49%). 42% of MRS expressed a multiple antibiotic
      resistance (MAR) index above 0.2. Three isolates expressed a MAR index of 0.8.
      MRS has been exhibited to be present in an otherwise healthy population of
      students, which may then act as a reservoir for MAR strains.

TI  - Intravenous versus Oral Step-Down for the Treatment of Staphylococcus aureus
      Bacteremia in a Pediatric Population.
LID - 16 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmacy10010016 [doi]
AB  - Limited data are available regarding optimal antimicrobial therapy for
      Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) in pediatric patients. The purpose of this
      study was to assess clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with
      intravenous (IV) versus oral step-down treatment of pediatric SAB. This study
      evaluated patients aged 3 months to 18 years that received at least 72 h of
      inpatient treatment for SAB. The primary endpoint was 30-day readmission.
      Secondary endpoints included hospital length of stay and inpatient mortality. One
      hundred and one patients were included in this study. The median age was 7.9
      years. Patients who underwent oral step-down were less likely to be
      immunocompromised and more likely to have community-acquired SAB from
      osteomyelitis or skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI). More patients in the IV
      therapy group had a 30-day readmission (10 (25.6%) vs. 3 (5.3%), p = 0.006).
      Mortality was low (5 (5%)) and not statistically different between groups. Length
      of stay was greater in patients receiving IV therapy only (11 vs. 7 days, p =
      0.001). In this study, over half of the patients received oral step-down therapy 
      and 30-day readmission was low for this group. Oral therapy appears to be safe
      and effective for patients with SAB from osteomyelitis or SSTIs.

TI  - Life-Threatening Necrotizing Pneumonia with Panton-Valentine
      Leukocidin-Producing, Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus in a Healthy
      Male Co-Infected with Influenza B.
PG  - 12-19
LID - 10.3390/idr14010002 [doi]
AB  - A previously healthy male was rushed into a hospital critically ill with
      confusion, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome only 43 h after having
      a normal chest X-ray and with blood samples showing only minimally elevated
      C-reactive protein. Two days earlier, the patient had returned to his home
      country, the Faroe Islands, from a 10-day work trip aboard a Scandinavian ship in
      Colombia. The diagnosis turned out to be an influenza B infection and necrotizing
      pneumonia with Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-producing methicillin-sensitive 
      Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). It was influenza season in Colombia but not in the 
      Faroe Islands. The frequency of MSSA with PVL-encoding genes among pediatric
      infection patients is very low in the Kingdom of Denmark and Faroe Islands and
      very high in Colombia, and the frequency generally varies highly by region. The
      patient in this case now suffers severe sequelae from the infection. With this
      case, we would like to remind clinicians of this rare but severe condition.
      PVL-producing S. aureus pneumonia should be considered in critically ill,
      previously healthy patients, especially during influenza season and if the
      patient has been traveling in countries with high frequencies of PVL-producing S.
      aureus.

TI  - Bacterial Species and Antimicrobial Resistance of Clinical Isolates from
      Pediatric Patients in Yangon, Myanmar, 2020.
PG  - 26-32
LID - 10.3390/idr14010004 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a concern in medical care for children who have
      high burden of infectious diseases. We investigated the prevalence of bacterial
      species and their susceptibility to antimicrobials of 1019 clinical isolates from
      pediatric patients in a tertiary-care hospital in Yangon, Myanmar for one-year
      period (2020). The most frequently recovered species was Escherichia coli,
      followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, all of which
      accounted for 43% of clinical isolates, while 25% of isolates comprised
      non-fermenter, including Pseudomonas sp. and Acinetobacter sp. Phenotypically
      determined ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase)-positive rates in E. coli, K. 
      pneumoniae, and Enterobacter sp. were 82%, 88%, and 65%, respectively. High rates
      of multiple drug resistance were noted for E. coli (84%), K. pneumoniae (81%),
      and Acinetobacter sp. (65%), associated with carbapenem resistance in 48%, 42%,
      and 59% of isolates, respectively. In contrast, S. aureus isolates exhibited low 
      resistance rates (<30%) to most of antimicrobials, with 22% being resistant to
      oxacillin/cefoxitin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was found in most of bacterial
      species with different prevalence rates. The present study revealed the current
      status on prevalence of bacterial species causing infections in pediatric
      patients in Myanmar, highlighting the significance to monitor AMR among children.

TI  - Preparation, Physicochemical Assessment and the Antimicrobial Action of
      Hydroxyapatite-Gelatin/Curcumin Nanofibrous Composites as a Dental Biomaterial.
LID - 4 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomimetics7010004 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we prepared and evaluated hydroxyapatite-gelatin/curcumin
      nanofibrous composites and determined their antimicrobial effects against
      Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans.
      Hydroxyapatite-gelatin/curcumin nanofibrous composites were prepared by the
      electrospinning method. The prepared nanocomposites were then subjected to
      physicochemical studies by the light scattering method for their particle size,
      Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to identify their functional
      groups, X-ray diffraction (XRD) to study their crystallinity, and scanning
      electron microscopy (SEM) to study their morphology. For the microbial evaluation
      of nanocomposites, the disk diffusion method was used against Streptococcus
      mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The results showed that the 
      nanofibers were uniform in shape without any bead (structural defects). The
      release pattern of curcumin from the nanocomposite was a two-stage release, 60%
      of which was released in the first two days and the rest being slowly released
      until the 14th day. The results of the microbial evaluations showed that the
      nanocomposites had significant antimicrobial effects against all bacteria (p =
      0.0086). It seems that these nanocomposites can be used in dental tissue
      engineering or as other dental materials. Also, according to the appropriate
      microbial results, these plant antimicrobials can be used instead of chemical
      antimicrobials, or along with them, to reduce bacterial resistance.

TI  - Energy Efficiency of Inference Algorithms for Clinical Laboratory Data Sets:
      Green Artificial Intelligence Study.
PG  - e28036
LID - 10.2196/28036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical domain has
      attracted considerable research interest. Inference applications in the medical
      domain require energy-efficient AI models. In contrast to other types of data in 
      visual AI, data from medical laboratories usually comprise features with strong
      signals. Numerous energy optimization techniques have been developed to relieve
      the burden on the hardware required to deploy a complex learning model. However, 
      the energy efficiency levels of different AI models used for medical applications
      have not been studied. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore and
      compare the energy efficiency levels of commonly used machine learning
      algorithms-logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, 
      random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithms, as well as
      four different variants of neural network (NN) algorithms-when applied to
      clinical laboratory datasets. METHODS: We applied the aforementioned algorithms
      to two distinct clinical laboratory data sets: a mass spectrometry data set
      regarding Staphylococcus aureus for predicting methicillin resistance (3338
      cases; 268 features) and a urinalysis data set for predicting Trichomonas
      vaginalis infection (839,164 cases; 9 features). We compared the performance of
      the nine inference algorithms in terms of accuracy, area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve (AUROC), time consumption, and power consumption. 
      The time and power consumption levels were determined using performance counter
      data from Intel Power Gadget 3.5. RESULTS: The experimental results indicated
      that the RF and XGB algorithms achieved the two highest AUROC values for both
      data sets (84.7% and 83.9%, respectively, for the mass spectrometry data set;
      91.1% and 91.4%, respectively, for the urinalysis data set). The XGB and LR
      algorithms exhibited the shortest inference time for both data sets (0.47
      milliseconds for both in the mass spectrometry data set; 0.39 and 0.47
      milliseconds, respectively, for the urinalysis data set). Compared with the RF
      algorithm, the XGB and LR algorithms exhibited a 45% and 53%-60% reduction in
      inference time for the mass spectrometry and urinalysis data sets, respectively. 
      In terms of energy efficiency, the XGB algorithm exhibited the lowest power
      consumption for the mass spectrometry data set (9.42 Watts) and the LR algorithm 
      exhibited the lowest power consumption for the urinalysis data set (9.98 Watts). 
      Compared with a five-hidden-layer NN, the XGB and LR algorithms achieved 16%-24% 
      and 9%-13% lower power consumption levels for the mass spectrometry and
      urinalysis data sets, respectively. In all experiments, the XGB algorithm
      exhibited the best performance in terms of accuracy, run time, and energy
      efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The XGB algorithm achieved balanced performance levels
      in terms of AUROC, run time, and energy efficiency for the two clinical
      laboratory data sets. Considering the energy constraints in real-world scenarios,
      the XGB algorithm is ideal for medical AI applications.

AB  - Lameness or leg weakness is the main cause of poor poultry welfare and serious
      economic losses in meat-type poultry production worldwide. Disorders related to
      the legs are often associated with multifactorial aetiology which makes diagnosis
      and proper treatment difficult. Among the infectious agents, bacteria of genus
      Staphylococcus are one of the most common causes of bone infections in poultry
      and are some of the oldest bacterial infections described in poultry.
      Staphylococci readily infect bones and joints and are associated with bacterial
      chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis (BCO), spondylitis, arthritis, tendinitis,
      tenosynovitis, osteomyelitis, turkey osteomyelitis complex (TOC), bumblefoot,
      dyschondroplasia with osteomyelitis and amyloid arthropathy. Overall, 61
      staphylococcal species have been described so far, and 56% of them (34/61) have
      been isolated from clinical cases in poultry. Although Staphylococcus aureus is
      the principal cause of poultry staphylococcosis, other Staphylococcus species,
      such as S. agnetis, S. cohnii, S. epidermidis, S. hyicus, S. simulans, have also 
      been isolated from skeletal lesions. Antimicrobial treatment of staphylococcosis 
      is usually ineffective due to the location and type of lesion, as well as the
      possible occurrence of multidrug-resistant strains. Increasing demand for
      antibiotic-free farming has contributed to the use of alternatives to
      antibiotics. Other prevention methods, such as better management strategies,
      early feed restriction or use of slow growing broilers should be implemented to
      avoid rapid growth rate, which is associated with locomotor problems. This review
      aims to summarise and address current knowledge on skeletal disorders associated 
      with Staphylococcus spp. infection in poultry.

TI  - Proteomics and Transcriptomics Uncover Key Processes for Elasnin Tolerance in
      Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - e0139321

AB  - Elasnin is a new antibiofilm compound that was recently reported to have
      excellent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
      biofilms. In this study, we established that elasnin also has antibacterial
      activity against growing S. aureus planktonic cells. To explore elasnin's
      potential as an antibiotic, we applied adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) and
      produced evolved strains with elevated elasnin tolerance. Interestingly, they
      were more sensitive toward daptomycin and lysostaphin. Whole-genome sequencing
      revealed that all of the evolved strains possessed a single point mutation in a
      putative phosphate transport regulator. Subsequently, they exhibited increased
      intracellular phosphate (Pi) and polyphosphate levels. Inhibition of the
      phosphate transport regulator gene changed the phenotype of the wild type to one 
      resembling those observed in the evolved strains. Proteomics and transcriptomics 
      analyses showed that elasnin treatment resulted in the downregulation of many
      proteins related to cell division and cell wall synthesis, which is important for
      the survival of growing exponential-phase cells. Other downregulated processes
      and factors were fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis, the two-component system, RNA
      degradation, and ribosomal proteins. Most importantly, transport proteins and
      proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and the phosphotransferase system 
      were more upregulated in the evolved strain than in the ancestral strain,
      indicating that they are important for elasnin tolerance. Overall, this study
      showed that elasnin has antibacterial activity against growing S. aureus cells
      and revealed the altered processes due to elasnin treatment and those associated 
      with its tolerance. IMPORTANCE Besides the excellent antibiofilm properties of
      elasnin, we discovered that it can also kill growing methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) planktonic cells. We subjected MRSA cells to an in
      vitro evolution experiment, and the resulting evolved strains exhibited increased
      elasnin tolerance, reduced growth rate, loss of pigmentation, and an increased
      proportion of small-colony formation, and they became more sensitive toward
      daptomycin and lysostaphin. Through multiomics analysis, we uncovered the
      affected processes in growing S. aureus planktonic cells following elasnin
      treatment, including the downregulation of cell wall synthesis, cell division,
      and some genes/proteins for the two-component system. These findings suggest that
      elasnin suppressed processes important for the cells' survival and adaptation to 
      environmental stresses, making it an ideal drug adjuvant candidate. Overall, our 
      study provides new insights into the mechanism of elasnin in S. aureus planktonic
      cells and pointed out the potential application of elasnin in clinics.

TI  - Staphylococcus-induced proliferative glomerulonephritis and cerebral hemorrhage -
      fatal complications in a young female with postpartum cardiomyopathy and an
      implanted left ventricular assist device: a case report and review of the
      literature.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1080/00015458.2022.2033928 [doi]
AB  - Background: The continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) is used 
      to save the lives of patients in the final stage of congestive heart failure,
      replacing the pump function of the left ventricle. Although quality of life
      increases significantly, CF-LVAD-related complications might prove fatal, as in
      the case presented in this paper.Methods: A 20-year-old female, during her second
      pregnancy, presented with signs of heart failure. Emergency caesarean section was
      necessary to save the baby, but peripartum cardiomyopathy developed in the
      mother. The use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was necessary 
      5 years later. As the clinical progression was unfavorable under medical
      treatment, with the patient reaching INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) Profile 1 (refractory cardiogenic
      shock), the treatment of choice was the implantation of a CF-LVAD.Results: After 
      3 years of follow-up (at the age of 28), the patient presented with a positive
      hemoculture for Staphylococcus aureus. Prolonged antibiotic therapy and attentive
      follow-up was prescribed. Although an effective antiplatelet and anticoagulant
      treatment was applied, and despite therapeutic values of prothrombin time and
      international normalized ratio (INR), the patient died as result of a fatal
      cerebral hemorrhage. The autopsy also revealed septic emboli, disseminated
      intravascular coagulation, and focal proliferative
      glomerulonephritis.Conclusions: Although the benefits of CF-LVAD are significant,
      bleeding episodes can be severe and LVAD-associated infection can trigger
      glomerular injury and increase mortality.

TI  - Cell cycle kinase CHEK2 in macrophages alleviates the inflammatory response to
      Staphylococcus aureus-induced pneumonia.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1080/01902148.2022.2029625 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Excessive macrophage-mediated inflammation participates in the
      development of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-induced pneumonia. Checkpoint
      kinase 2 (Chek2) was screened out as macrophage-related infantile pneumonia gene 
      after the differentially expressed analysis of RNAseq data derived from pam3CSK4 
      stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). METHODS: RAW264.7 macrophage 
      cells were transfected with Chek2-specific gRNA, which were further overexpressed
      with wide-type Chek2 or Chek2 kinase activity mutant (Chek2 KD, D368N). At the
      same time, the relative protein and mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines
      were determined. C57BL/6J WT mice were intranasally infected with S. aureus to
      induce S. aureus-induced pneumonia, which was treated with BML-277, an inhibitor 
      of Chek2. The symptoms of pneumonia mice and inflammatory cytokines associated
      with the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways were further
      examined. RESULTS: In vivo, BML-277 significantly promoted pneumonia symptoms,
      including mortality, lung infiltration of immune cells, and the abundance of lung
      pro-inflammatory cytokines. Mechanically, BML-277 did not affect BMDMs survival
      but up-regulated the mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), nitric oxide
      synthase 2 (Nos2), interleukin (Il)23a, and the secretion of Tnf-alpha and
      Il-23a. At the same time, genetic complementation experiment testified that Chek2
      KD did not inhibit NF-kappaB and relevant inflammatory cytokines expression.
      CONCLUSION: Chek2 functions through the kinase mechanism to down-regulate the
      NF-kappaB pathway in macrophages to alleviate S. aureus-induced pneumonia in
      mice.

TI  - Inhibition of bacterial growth through LED (light-emitting diode) 465 and 630 nm:
      in vitro.
LID - 10.1007/s10103-022-03505-3 [doi]
AB  - Photobiomodulation has been used to inactivate bacterial growth, in different
      laser or LED protocols. Thus, the aim of this study was to verify the inhibition 
      of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, in ATCC
      strains and bacteria collected from patients with skin burns, after irradiation
      with LED; 300 mul of saline solution with bacterial suspension was irradiated at 
      a concentration of 0.5-0.63, by the McFarland scale, after five serial dilutions,
      with evaluation of pre- and post-irradiation pH and temperature control. The
      cultures were placed in a bacteriological incubator at 37 degrees C for 24 h for 
      later counting of colony-forming units (CFU). Data were analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk 
      tests and single-factor ANOVA, with Tukey post hoc (p < 0.05). Both wavelengths
      and energy densities tested showed inhibition of bacterial growth. The comparison
      of the irradiated groups (ATCC) with the control group showed the following: S.
      aureus and P. aeruginosa 465 nm (40 J/cm(2)) and 630 nm (50 J/cm(2)) and E. coli 
      465 nm (40 J/cm(2)) and 630 nm (30 J/cm(2)). Among the ATCC S. aureus groups,
      there was a difference for 630 nm (30 J/cm(2)) and 465 nm (30, 40, 50 J/cm(2)).
      The bacteria from the burned patients were S. aureus (30 and 50 J/cm(2)) and P.
      aeruginosa (50 J/cm(2)). We conclude that different bacterial strains were
      reduced into colony-forming units after LED irradiation.

      features of high-level mupirocin resistant- (HLMUPR-) S. aureus isolates in
      Tehran. In the present research, we investigated 48 high-level mupirocin
      resistance S. aureus by antimicrobial activity, virulence analysis, biofilm
      formation, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and staphylocoagulase (SC) typing. 
      All the HLMUPR strains were positive for mupA gene. The frequency of multidrug
      resistance was 97.9%. Twenty-one (43.8%) were toxinogenic with 14 producing pvl
      (29.2%), 5 tst (10.4%), and two eta (4.2%). Among the HLMUPR isolates, biofilm
      production was detected in 45 (89.6%) isolates with complete dominance clfB, clfA
      genes, and a noticeably high frequency fnbA (95.8%), followed by fnbB (93.8%),
      eno and icaD (each 83.3%), sdrC (81.3%), ebps (79.2%), icaA (75%), sdrD (66.7%), 
      fib (60.4%), sdrE (50%), cna (41.7%), and bap (4.2%). Coagulase typing
      distinguished isolates into four genotypic patterns including III (50%), II
      (27.1%), and type IVa (22.9%). A total of three clonal complexes (CCs) and 4
      sequence types (STs) including CC/ST22 as the most prevalent (52.1%), CC8/ST239
      (20.8%), CC/ST8 (16.7%), and CC/ST5 (10.4%) were identified in current work.
      According to our analysis, nonbiofilm producer isolates belonged to CC8/ST239
      (6.3%) and CC/ST8 (4.2%). Fusidic acid-resistant isolates belonged to CC/ST45 (n 
      = 3) and CC8/ST239 (n = 1). Observations highlighted the circulation of the
      CC/ST22 HLMUPR S. aureus strains with strong biofilm-production ability in our
      hospitals, indicating the possibility of transmission of this type between
      community and hospital.

      Practice Patterns.

LID - 10.5812/aapm.120611 [doi]
AB  - Background: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an established treatment modality
      for neuropathic pain. Published guidelines exist to aid physicians in proper
      antibiotic use during and after spinal cord stimulation trials and implants. In
      this brief review, we present and analyze the current antibiotic practice
      patterns of clinicians. Methods: The study protocol was reviewed and granted an
      exemption by an Institutional Review Board. The survey queried practice
      parameters in regards to spinal cord stimulation therapy. The American Society of
      Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) and Society of Interventional Spine 
      (SIS) distributed the survey to their active members by emails with a web link to
      the survey. Results: Our results indicate that 82% and 69% of physicians do not
      utilize nasal swabs for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) or
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), respectively, prior to SCS
      trial and implantation. During trials, 47% providers administer a single dose of 
      antibiotics, 35% administer antibiotics for the duration of the trial, and 17% do
      not administer antibiotics. During implantation, 44% of physicians administer a
      single dose during the procedure, 11% administer antibiotics up to 24 hours, 24% 
      administer antibiotics between 3-5 days, 14% administer antibiotics for more than
      5 days, and 4% do not administer antibiotics. Conclusions: Our study suggests a
      portion of pain physicians do not adhere to the Neuromodulation Appropriateness
      Consensus Committee (NACC) guidelines in regards to antibiotic administration for
      SCS trial and implantation. Further analysis and surveys would allow insight into
      common practices. More information and education would be beneficial to optimize 
      peri-procedure antibiotic use to reduce infection risk and decrease antimicrobial
      resistance.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic, pathogenic bacteria that causes
      significant morbidity and mortality. As antibiotic resistance by S. aureus
      continues to be a serious concern, developing novel drug therapies to combat
      these infections is vital. Quorum sensing inhibitors (QSI) dampen S. aureus
      virulence and facilitate clearance by the host immune system by blocking quorum
      sensing signaling that promotes upregulation of virulence genes controlled by the
      accessory gene regulator (agr) operon. While QSIs have shown therapeutic promise 
      in mouse models of S. aureus skin infection, their further development has been
      hampered by the suggestion that agr inhibition promotes biofilm formation. In
      these studies, we investigated the relationship between agr function and biofilm 
      growth across various S. aureus strains and experimental conditions, including in
      a mouse model of implant-associated infection. We found that agr deletion was
      associated with the presence of increased biofilm only under narrow in vitro
      conditions and, crucially, was not associated with enhanced biofilm development
      or enhanced morbidity in vivo.

      combat antibiotic resistance.
PG  - 1218
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-05303-x [doi]
AB  - The overuse of antibiotics in clinical and livestock settings is accelerating the
      selection of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. Antibiotic resistant
      bacteria result in increased mortality and financial strain on the health care
      and livestock industry. The development of new antibiotics has stalled, and novel
      strategies are needed as we enter the age of antibiotic resistance. Certain
      naturally occurring clays have been shown to have antimicrobial properties and
      kill antibiotic resistant bacteria. Harnessing the activity of compounds within
      these clays that harbor antibiotic properties offers new therapeutic
      opportunities for fighting the potentially devastating effects of the post
      antibiotic era. However, natural samples are highly heterogenous and exhibit
      variable antibacterial effectiveness, therefore synthesizing minerals of high
      purity with reproducible antibacterial activity is needed. Here we describe for
      the first time synthetic smectite clay minerals and Fe-sulfide microspheres that 
      reproduce the geochemical antibacterial properties observed in natural occurring 
      clays. We show that these mineral formulations are effective at killing the
      ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
      Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter sp.) by maintaining
      Fe(2+) solubility and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production while buffering
      solution pH, unlike the application of metals alone. Our results represent the
      first step in utilizing a geochemical process to treat antibiotic resistant
      topical or gastrointestinal infections in the age of antibiotic resistance.

      staphylococcal phage endolysins.
PG  - 1245
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-05361-1 [doi]
AB  - Bacteriophage endolysins degrade the bacterial cell wall and are therefore
      considered promising antimicrobial alternatives to fight pathogens resistant to
      conventional antibiotics. Gram-positive bacteria are usually considered easy
      targets to exogenously added endolysins, since their cell walls are not shielded 
      by an outer membrane. However, in nutrient rich environments these bacteria can
      also tolerate endolysin attack if they keep an energized cytoplasmic membrane.
      Hence, we have hypothesized that the membrane depolarizing action of
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), another attractive class of alternative
      antibacterials, could be explored to overcome bacterial tolerance to endolysins
      and consequently improve their antibacterial potential. Accordingly, we show that
      under conditions supporting bacterial growth, Staphylococcus aureus becomes much 
      more susceptible to the bacteriolytic action of endolysins if an AMP is also
      present. The bactericidal gain resulting from the AMP/endolysin combined action
      ranged from 1 to 3 logs for different S. aureus strains, which included
      drug-resistant clinical isolates. In presence of an AMP, as with a reduced
      content of cell wall teichoic acids, higher endolysin binding to cells is
      observed. However, our results indicate that this higher endolysin binding alone 
      does not fully explain the higher susceptibility of S. aureus to lysis in these
      conditions. Other factors possibly contributing to the increased endolysin
      susceptibility in presence of an AMP are discussed.

AB  - Globally, the burden of chronic wound infections is likely to increase due to the
      rising levels of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. In the United States of
      America alone, more than 6.5 million chronic wounds with evidence of bacterial
      infection are diagnosed every year. In addition, the polymicrobial environment in
      chronic wound infections has been observed from several studies as a risk factor 
      for development of resistance to many antibiotics including the third generation 
      cephalosporins currently used in Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital for treatment
      of chronic wound infections. Therefore the main objective of this study was to
      determine the prevalence of chronic wound isolates and their minimum inhibitory
      concentrations (MIC) against third generation cephalosporins. This study was a
      cross-sectional descriptive and analytical survey of bacterial isolates from
      chronic wound infection among 75 study participants admitted in the surgical ward
      of Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH), a tertiary Hospital in Western
      Uganda. Standard laboratory bacterial culture and identification techniques as
      well as broth microdilution method were used to isolate, identify pathogens and
      test for MIC respectively. We found that 69/75 study participants had samples
      with bacterial growth and the most prevalent pathogens isolated were
      staphylococcus aureus (40.6%) and Klebsiella spp. (29%). Generally, most isolates
      were susceptible to cefoperazone + sulbactum 2 g (Sulcef) and ceftriaxone 1 g
      (Epicephin). The overall prevalence of isolates in chronic wound infection among 
      patients admitted in the surgical ward of MRRH was 92% and the most prevalent
      isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella species and proteus species
      respectively. The observed MIC values were higher than the CLSI clinical
      breakpoint, implying a decreasing trend in susceptibility of chronic wound
      isolates to third generation cephalosporins.

TI  - Septic arthritis following joint injections: a 17 years retrospective study in an
      Academic General Hospital.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Septic arthritis following intra-articular infiltrations is an
      uncommon devastating complication correlated to high costs for the health service
      and often to poor outcomes. The purpose of this study is to assess a 17-years
      experience in a single academic multispecialist hospital managing this uncommon
      complication in Orthopaedic practice. METHODS: Patients with diagnosis of septic 
      arthritis following joint injections treated in our hospital from January 2002 to
      December 2019 were included in the study. Clinical and demographic data,
      pathogens, injected agent, conservative/surgical treatments were reviewed.
      Patient were classified according to the ore operative Charlson Comorbidity Index
      (CCI) and the Cierny-Mader Classification(CMC). Furthermore follow-up outcome and
      time occurred to infection eradication were registered. RESULTS: We included in
      the study 11 patients with a median age of 74 years old (IQR= 61.5 - 79). The
      median CCI was 3 (IQR= 2 - 5) and the majority of patients belong to CMC = B
      class. Septic arthritis occurred mainly following corticosteroids injections and 
      more frequently involving knees. The pathogen more often isolated was
      Staphylococcus aureus. Five (45%) patients referred an history of multiple
      intrarticular injections. 7 patients (64%) had a complete resolution following an
      arthroscopic debridement, 4 (36%) patients underwent to a 2-stage replacement and
      one of them hesitated in an arthrodesis because of a recurrent periprothesic
      joint infection and extensor apparatus insufficiency. CONCLUSION: The authors
      observed a potential increased risk of septic arthritis following joint injection
      in patients with history of multiple injections and poor health/immunological
      conditions. They recommend an early arthroscopic debridement as the treatment of 
      choice especially in septic knees performed in a multispecialist dedicated
      center.

TI  - Blood bacterial resistant investigation collaborative system (BRICS) report: a
      national surveillance in China from 2014 to 2019.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/s13756-022-01055-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this first national bloodstream infection (BSI) surveillance
      program in China, we assessed the composition of pathogenic bacteria and the
      trends for antimicrobial susceptibility over a 6-year period in China. METHODS:
      Blood bacterial isolates from patients at hospitals participating in the Blood
      Bacterial Resistant Investigation Collaborative System (BRICS) were collected
      from January 2014 to December 2019. Only the first isolate of a species per
      patient was eligible over the full study period. Antibiotic-susceptibility
      testing was conducted by agar-dilution or broth-dilution methods as recommended
      by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). WHONET 5.6 was used to
      analyze data. RESULTS: During the study period, 27,899 bacterial strains were
      collected. Gram-positive organisms accounted for 29.5% (8244) of the species
      identified and Gram-negative organisms accounted for 70.5% (19,655). The
      most-commonly isolated organisms in blood cultures were Escherichia coli,
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci,
      and Acinetobacter baumannii. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms,
      such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii was higher in tertiary hospitals,
      whereas extended-spectrum, beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (ESBL-E. coli),
      carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii were more prevalent in economically-developing 
      areas. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus declined from 39.0%
      (73/187) in 2014 to 25.9% (230/889) in 2019 (p < 0.05). The prevalence of ESBL-E.
      coli dropped from 61.2% (412/673) to 51.0% (1878/3,683) over time (p < 0.05), and
      carbapenem-resistant E. coli remained low prevalence (< 2%; 145/9944; p = 0.397).
      In contrast, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae increased markedly from 7.0%
      (16/229) in 2014 to 19.6% (325/1,655) in 2019 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: E. coli and
      K. pneumoniae were the leading causes of BSI during the 6-year study period. The 
      major resistant pathogens declined or remained stable, whereas
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae continued to increase, which poses a great
      therapeutic challenge for BSIs.

PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1080/09537104.2022.2026907 [doi]
AB  - Thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction is a risk factor for severe infection.
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) releases a variety of virulence factors
      especially toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1), which may cause toxic shock
      syndrome. S. aureus, when carrying the tst gene, is more prone to cause toxic
      shock syndrome and is responsible for an especially high rate of mortality.
      However, the effect of TSST-1 protein on platelets is unknown. Patients with the 
      tst gene positive S. aureus bacteremia showed more serious infection, higher
      mortality and lower platelet count. The tst gene positive S. aureus strains
      induce more platelet apoptosis and activation and corresponding up-regulation of 
      Bak and down-regulation of Bcl-XL in addition to the activation of Caspase-3.
      C57BL/6 mice infected with the tst gene positive strains resulted in both a
      decrease in platelet count and an increase in platelet apoptosis and/or
      activation events and mortality. Moreover, TSST-1 protein, encoded by tst gene,
      caused the decrease of platelet count, the increase of platelet apoptosis and
      activation events and the level of inflammatory cytokines in vivo. However,
      TSST-1 protein was unable to induce traditional activation and apoptosis on human
      platelets in vitro. These results suggested that TSST-1 protein may exert
      indirect effects on platelet activation and apoptosis in vivo.

AB  - Trigonella genus is a member of Fabaceae family, which is used as medicinal
      plant. The aim of this study was investigation of phytochemicals and some
      biological activities of Trigonella teheranica for the first time. The essential 
      oils (EOs) of different parts (leaves, fruits and roots) were obtained and
      analyzed by GC-MS. Also, their chloroform and methanol extracts were prepared,
      too. The antimicrobial effects, antioxidant activities and cytotoxic effects
      against cancer (MDA-MB-231, MRC5 and HT-29) cell lines were investigated.
      N-hexadecanoic acid was the major compound of leaves and fruits EOs, and hexanal 
      was abundant component of roots EO. The extracts showed stronger antibacterial
      effects than volatile oils against Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus 
      aureus and Bacillus subtilis. All methanol extracts showed strong antioxidant
      effects, while the volatile oils, especially of leaves was the most effective in 
      cytotoxic assay. Also, three derivatives of coumaric acid were isolated and
      identified from T. teheranica.

AB  - The goals of this study were to determine the phytochemical profile of Jodina
      rhombifolia and to evaluate the ability of supercritical fluids (ScFCO2) to
      selectively extract the metabolites responsible for the bioactivity. This species
      has simple aromatic compounds and lignan monomers, as well as glycerides
      containing epoxidized saturated fatty acids. Regarding the extraction by ScFCO2, 
      the extracts showed a higher antimicrobial activity against human pathogenic
      strains, with respect to the ethanolic extracts obtained from plant residues
      after extraction by ScFCO2. Furthermore, the bioactive compounds were
      concentrated in just 1% P/P of the weight of the dry plant material. Extraction
      by ScFCO2 was carried out under different conditions of pressure and temperature,
      with the best results being obtained at 30 degrees C and 30 MPa. The results
      obtained demonstrate the advantages of ScFCO2 extractions over classical solvent 
      extractions, in terms of improved safety and the ability to selectively extract
      the compounds of interest.

AB  - Pyomyositis is a bacterial infection occurring mainly in skeletal muscles. It is 
      most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus with initial symptoms including
      muscle pain, swelling, and site tenderness. When available, the most accurate
      technique to determine the extent and the specific location of disease is the
      magnetic resonance imaging. Successful management includes early recognition,
      timely surgical debridement or drainage, and appropriate antibiotic therapy. This
      case report describes a case of Mycobacterium fortuitum pyomyositis in an elderly
      male associated with challenges of successful diagnosis.

TI  - Cytotoxic activity of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from a cohort of Mexican
      children with cystic fibrosis.
LID - 10.24875/BMHIM.21000126 [doi]
AB  - Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease in which thick, sticky
      mucus is produced in the lungs (and other organs) that impairs ciliary clearance,
      leading to respiratory problems, increased chronic bacterial infections, and
      decreased lung function. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the primary bacterial
      pathogens colonizing the lungs of CF patients. This study aimed to characterize
      the genetic relatedness of S. aureus, its presence in children with CF, and its
      cytotoxic activity in THP1 cell-derived macrophages (THP1m). Methods: Genetic
      relatedness of S. aureus isolates from a cohort of 50 children with CF was
      determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The VITEK 2 automated
      system was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility, and
      methicillin-resistance S. aureus (MRSA) was determined by diffusion testing using
      cefoxitin disk. The presence of mecA and lukPV genes was determined by the
      polymerase chain reaction and cytotoxic activity of S.aureus on THP1m by CytoTox 
      96(R) assay. Results: From 51 S. aureus isolates from 50 children with CF, we
      identified 34pulsotypes by PFGE. Of the 50 children, 12 (24%) were colonized by
      more than one pulsotype, and 5/34 identified pulsotypes(14.7%) were shared
      between unrelated children. In addition, 3/34 pulsotypes (8.8%) were
      multidrug-resistant (MDR), and2/34 (5.9%) were MRSA. Notably, 30/34 pulsotypes
      (88.2%) exhibited cytotoxicity on THP1m cells and 14/34 (41.2%) alteredTHP1m
      monolayers. No isolate carried the lukPV gene. Conclusions: Although a low
      frequency of MRSA and MDR wasfound among clinical isolates, most of the S. aureus
      pulsotypes identified were cytotoxic on THP1m.

PG  - 2532-2547
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c01982 [doi]
AB  - Currently, cancer patients with microbial infection are a severe challenge in
      clinical treatment. To address the problem, we synthesized hemiprotonic compounds
      based on the unique structure of hemiprotonic nucleotide base pairs in a DNA
      i-motif. These compounds were produced from phenanthroline (ph) dimerization with
      phenanthroline as a proton receptor and ammonium as a donor. The biological
      activity shows that the compounds have a selective antitumor effect through
      inducing cell apoptosis. The molecular mechanism could be related to specific
      inhibition of transcription factor PLAGL2 of tumor cells, assessed by
      transcriptomic analysis. Moreover, results show that the hemiprotonic ph-ph(+)
      has broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal activities, and drug-resistant
      bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, are sensitive to
      the compound. In animal models of liver cancer with fungal infection, the
      ph-ph(+) retards proliferation of hepatoma cells in tumor-bearing mice and
      remedies pneumonia and encephalitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. The study 
      provides a novel therapeutic candidate for cancer patients accompanied by
      infection.

      success of Staphylococcus haemolyticus as an opportunistic pathogen.
LID - 10.1099/mgen.0.000755 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus haemolyticus is a species of coagulase-negative staphylococci that
      has primarily been studied as a human skin microbiome member and an emerging
      nosocomial pathogen. Here, we present the first complete genome of S.
      haemolyticus strains SE3.9, SE3.8 and SE2.14 reported as an endophyte of rice
      seed. Detailed investigation of the genome dynamics of strains from diverse
      origins revealed an expanded genome size in clinical isolates, and a role of many
      insertion sequence (IS) elements in strain diversification. Interestingly,
      several of the IS elements are also unique or enriched in a particular habitat.
      Comparative studies also revealed the potential movement of mobile elements from 
      rice endophytic S. haemolyticus to strains from other pathogenic species such as 
      Staphylococcus aureus. The study highlights the importance of ecological studies 
      in the systematic understanding of genome plasticity and management of medically 
      important Staphylococcus species.

AB  - String of vanadium (IV), zirconium (IV), palladium (II), platinum (IV) and
      uranium (VI) chelates of 2-cyano-2-[(2-nitrophenyl)hydrazono]thioacetamide
      (Cnphta) were prepared and characterized by physicochemical, spectroscopic and
      thermal analyses. The formulae of the isolated solid complexes were assigned as
      [VO(Cnphta)2 (H2 O)]SO4 5H2 O (1), [ZrO(Cnphta)2 (H2 O)]Cl2 4H2 O (2),
      [Pd(Cnphta)2 ]Cl2 (3), [Pt(Cnphta)2 Cl2 ]Cl2 (4) and [UO2 (Cnphta)2 ](NO3 )2 5H2 
      O (5). The infrared assignments clearly showed that Cnphta ligand coordinated as 
      a bidentate feature through the hydrazono nitrogen and the thioacetamide nitrogen
      for V(IV), Zr(IV) and U(VI) but displayed different behavior for Pd(II) and
      Pt(IV). Results of the molar conductivities measurements showed that the metal
      complexes were electrolytes in contrast with Cnphta ligand. The interpretation,
      mathematical analysis and evaluation of kinetic parameters were also carried out.
      In addition, the studied ligand and its new chelates were tested for their
      antimicrobial activity against some human or phytopathogenic microorganisms. The 
      new metal complexes explicated promising antibacterial activity against all
      tested bacteria especially Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. Regarding
      the antifungal activity, all metal complexes were able to inhibit the mycelium
      growth of both tested pathogenic fungi. In particular Zr(IV) and Pt(IV) complexes
      showed the highest significant fungicidal effect against A. fumigatus similar to 
      positive control.

TI  - The global burden of hospitalisation due to pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus
      aureus in the under-5 years children: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 101267
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.101267 [doi]
AB  - Background: Pneumonia is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality.
      This study aimed to estimate the global hospitalisation due to Staphylococcus
      aureus pneumonia in under-5 children. Methods: We conducted a systematic review
      and meta-analysis of primary studies following the PRISMA-P guidelines. We
      searched Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus, Scopus,
      China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and CQvip. We included studies 
      reporting data on Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, confirmed by detection of the 
      pathogen in sterile-site samples in under-5 hospitalised children, published in
      English or Chinese language and conducted between 1st January 1990 and 4th
      November 2021 and between 1st January 1990 and 30th September 2020, respectively.
      We excluded those testing upper respiratory tract samples and not reporting data 
      on samples with other bacteria or absence of bacteria. We screened papers against
      pre-specified criteria, extracted data and assessed the bacteriological quality, 
      and combined epidemiological and microbiological quality of studies using two
      self-designed checklists. Pooled proportions of hospitalisation episodes for
      Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia amongst all-cause pneumonia and the 95%
      confidence intervals were calculated using the random-effects model. The review
      protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021236606). Findings: Of 26,218 studies
      identified, thirty-five studies enroling 20,708 hospitalised pneumonia episodes
      were included. Out of the total hospitalised pneumonia cases in this population, 
      the pooled proportion of Staphylococcal pneumonia cases was 3% (95% CI 2% to 4%; 
      I(2)=96%). amongst 12 studies with higher microbiological quality, the pooled
      estimate was 6% (95% CI 2% to 10%; I(2)= 98%). Based on the recent global
      estimates of hospitalised pneumonia in this age group, the 3% and 6% estimates
      represent 738 thousand and 1.48 million hospitalisations in 2019, respectively.
      Based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
      (GRADE), the overall quality of evidence was considered to be moderate.
      Interpretation: Our findings are probably an underestimate because of the unknown
      and the likely limited sensitivity of current testing methods for Staphylococcal 
      pneumonia diagnosis and widespread reported use of antibiotics before recruitment
      (in 46% of cases). Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of hospitalisation
      for pneumonia in young children globally. Funding: Bill and Melinda Gates

      increased tolerance to innate immunity.
PG  - 513-527
LID - 10.3934/microbiol.2021031 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is widely known for its resistance and virulence causing
      public health concerns. However, antibiotic tolerance is also a contributor to
      chronic and relapsing infections. Previously, it has been demonstrated that
      persister formation is dependent on reduced tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
      activity. Persisters have been extensively examined in terms of antibiotic
      tolerance but tolerance to antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) remains largely
      unexplored. AMPs are a key component of both the human and Drosophila innate
      immune response. TCA cycle mutants were tested to determine both antibiotic and
      AMP tolerance. Challenging with multiple classes of antibiotics led to increased 
      persister formation (100- to 1,000-fold). Similarly, TCA mutants exhibited AMP
      tolerance with a 100- to 1,000-fold increase in persister formation when
      challenged with LL-37 or human beta-defensin 3 (hbetaD3). The ability of TCA
      cycle mutants to tolerate the innate immune system was further examined with a D.
      melanogaster model. Both males and females infected with TCA cycle mutants
      exhibited increased mortality and had higher bacterial burdens (1.5 log) during
      the course of the infection. These results suggest increasing the percentage of
      persister cells leads to increased tolerance to components of the innate immune
      system.

TI  - Antimicrobial activities encountered by sulfur nanoparticles combating
      Staphylococcal species harboring sccmecA recovered from acne vulgaris.
PG  - 481-498
LID - 10.3934/microbiol.2021029 [doi]
AB  - Over decades, sulfur has been employed for treatment of many dermatological
      diseases, several skin and soft tissue, and Staphylococcus infections. Because of
      its abuse, resistant bacterial strains have emerged. Nanotechnology has presented
      a new horizon to overcome abundant problems including drug resistance. Nano-sized
      sulfur has proven to retain bactericidal activity. Consequently, the specific
      aims of this study are exclusively directed to produce various sulfur
      nanoparticles formulations with control of particle size and morphology and
      investigate the antibacterial activity response specifically classified by the
      category of responses of different formulations, for the treatment of acne
      vulgaris resistant to conventional antibiotics. In this study, we produced
      uncoated sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs), sulfur nano-composite with chitosan
      (CS-SNPs), and sulfur nanoparticles coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG-SNPs)
      and evaluate their bactericidal impact against Staphylococcus aureus and
      Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from 173 patients clinically diagnosed acne
      vulgaris. Accompanied with molecular investigations of ermB and mecA resistance
      genes distribution among the isolates. Sulfur nanoparticles were synthesized
      using acid precipitation method and were characterized by scanning electron
      microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersed x-ray 
      spectroscopy (EDX), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Moreover,
      agar diffusion and broth micro-dilution methods were applied to determine their
      antibacterial activity and their minimum inhibitory concentration. PCR analysis
      for virulence factors detection. Results: TEM analysis showed particle size of
      SNPs (11.7 nm), PEG-SNPs (27 nm) and CS-SNPs (33 nm). Significant antibacterial
      activity from nanoparticles formulations in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with
      inhibition zone 30 mm and MIC at 5.5 microg/mL. Furthermore, the prevalence of
      mecA gene was the most abundant among the isolates while ermB gene was
      infrequent. Conclusions: sulfur nanoparticles preparations are an effective
      treatment for most Staphylococcus bacteria causing acne vulgaris harboring
      multi-drug resistance virulence factors.

LID - 10.3934/microbiol.2021026 [doi]
AB  - The probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from Thai
      traditional fermented food was investigated. Forty-two samples were collected
      from four markets in Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province. Out of 50 isolated LAB, 6
      (a3, f4, f8, K1, K4 and K9) obtained from pla-ra and bamboo shoot pickle samples 
      showed high tolerance to gastrointestinal tract conditions. These isolates were
      selected to identify and characterize their probiotic properties. Isolate a3 was 
      identified as Weissella thailandensis, isolates f4 and f8 were identified as
      belonging to Enterococcus thailandicus and isolates K1, K4 and K9 were determined
      as Limosilactobacillus fermentum. All six LAB exhibited high autoaggregation
      ability (93.40-95.01%), while W. thailandensis isolate a3 showed potential for
      coaggregation in almost all the pathogenic bacteria tested. Cell-free supernatant
      (CFS) obtained from all isolates did not inhibit Staphylococcus aureus. CFS
      derived from L. fermentum isolate K4 showed the most efficient antimicrobial
      activity, in particular against Gram-negative bacteria, while L. fermentum
      isolate K4 presented high surface hydrophobicity in the presence of xylene and
      n-hexane. All LAB isolates were found to be resistant to clindamycin and
      nalidixic acid, whereas E. thailandicus isolate f8 exhibited resistance to most
      of the antibiotics tested. L. fermentum isolate K4 showed promise as a suitable
      probiotic candidate for future applications in the food industry due to tolerance
      to gastrointestinal tract conditions with high surface hydrophobicity and
      inhibited most of the pathogens tested.

TI  - Non-antimicrobial and Non-anticancer Properties of ZnO Nanoparticles
      Biosynthesized Using Different Plant Parts of Bixa orellana.
PG  - 1914-1933
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.1c05324 [doi]
AB  - As traditional cancer therapy is toxic to both normal and cancer cells, there is 
      a need for newer approaches to specifically target cancer cells. ZnO
      nanoparticles can be promising due their biocompatible nature. However, ZnO
      nanoparticles have also shown cytotoxicity against mammalian cells in some cases,
      because of which there is a need for newer synthesis approaches for biocompatible
      ZnO nanoparticles to be used as carrier molecules in drug delivery applications. 
      Here, we report the biosynthesis of ZnO nanoparticles using different plant parts
      (leaf, seed, and seed coat) of Bixa orellana followed by different
      characterizations. The UV-visible spectra of ZnO showed absorption maxima at 341 
      and 353 nm, 378 and 373 nm, and 327 and 337 nm, respectively, before and after
      calcination corresponding to the band gap energy of 3.636 and 3.513 eV, 3.280 and
      3.324 eV, and 3.792 and 3.679 eV for L-ZnO, S-ZnO, and Sc-ZnO, respectively.
      X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of hexagonal wurtzite
      structures. Attenuated total reflectance infrared spectra revealed the presence
      of stretching vibrations of C-C, C=C, C=O, and NH3 (+) groups along with C-H
      deformation involving biomolecules from extracts responsible for reduction and
      stabilization of nanoparticles. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and
      transmission electron microscopy images showed spherical and almond-like
      morphologies of L-ZnO and Sc-ZnO with spherical morphologies, whereas S-ZnO
      showed almond-like morphologies. The presence of antibacterial activity was
      observed in L-ZnO against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, in S-ZnO
      nanoparticles only against Escherichia coli, and in Sc-ZnO only against
      Staphylococcus aureus. Uncalcinated ZnO nanoparticles showed weak antibacterial
      activities, whereas calcinated ZnO nanoparticles showed a non-antibacterial
      nature. The antifungal activity against different fungi (Penicillium sp.,
      Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium oxysporum, and Rhizoctonia solani) and cytotoxicity 
      against HCT-116 cancer cells were not observed before and after calcination in
      all three ZnO nanoparticles. The antimicrobial nature and biocompatibility of ZnO
      nanoparticles were influenced by different parameters of the nanoparticles along 
      with microorganisms and the human cells. Non-antimicrobial properties of ZnO
      nanoparticles can be treated as a pre-requisite for its biocompatibility due to
      its inert nature. Thus, biosynthesized ZnO nanoparticles showed a nontoxic
      nature, which can be exploited as promising alternatives in biomedical
      applications.

      Chitosan/Gelatin Nanofibrous Nanocomposite Scaffolds.
PG  - 1838-1850
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.1c05095 [doi]
AB  - This study aims at preparing electrospun chitosan/gelatin nanofiber scaffolds
      reinforced with different amounts of graphene nanosheets to be used as
      antibacterial and wound-healing scaffolds. Full characterization was carried out 
      for the different fabricated scaffolds before being assessed for their
      antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus,
      cytotoxicity, and cell migration capacity. Raman and transmission electron
      microscopies confirmed the successful reinforcement of nanofibers with graphene
      nanosheets. Scanning electron microscopy and porosity revealed that nanofibers
      reinforced with 0.15% graphene nanosheets produced the least diameter (106 +/- 30
      nm) and the highest porosity (90%), in addition to their good biodegradability
      and swellability. However, the excessive increase in graphene nanosheet amount
      produced beaded nanofibers with decreased porosity, swellability, and
      biodegradability. Interestingly, nanofibers reinforced with 0.15% graphene
      nanosheets showed E. coli and S. aureus growth inhibition percents of 50 and 80%,
      respectively. The cell viability assay showed no cytotoxicity on human
      fibroblasts when cultured with either unreinforced or reinforced nanofibers. The 
      cell migration was higher in the case of reinforced nanofibers when compared to
      the unreinforced nanofibers after 24 and 48 h, which is substantially associated 
      with the great effect of the graphene nanosheets on the cell migration
      capability. Unreinforced and reinforced nanofibers showed cell migration results 
      up to 93.69 and 97%, respectively, after 48 h.

      Bacteria.
PG  - 1671-1681

AB  - Infectious diseases caused by bacteria have become a public health issue.
      Antibiotic therapy for infectious disorders, as well as antibiotic overuse, has
      resulted in antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Zeolitic imidazolate
      framework-8 (ZIF-8) possesses a wide surface area, high porosity, variable
      functionality, and potential drug carriers. We have established a clear method
      for making a nanoscale APE@ZIF-8 nanocomposite agent with outstanding
      antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
      and cephalosporin-carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (CCREC). We present a
      unique approach for encapsulating molecules ofAjuga parviflora extract (APE) with
      ZIF-8. APE@ZIF-8 has a positive charge. By electrostatic contact with the
      negatively charged bacterial surface of S. aureus and E. coli, APE@ZIF-8 NPs
      produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage bacterial cell organelles. As a
      result, the APE@ZIF-8 nanocomposite offers limitless application potential in the
      treatment of infectious disorders caused by drug-resistant gram-positive and
      gram-negative bacteria.

PG  - ofab642
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofab642 [doi]
AB  - Clinical significance of a single positive blood culture bottle (SPBCB) with
      Staphylococcus aureus is unclear. We aimed to assess the significance of an SPBCB
      by looking at the associated outcomes. We performed a retrospective, multicenter 
      study of patients with an SPBCB with S aureus using data collected from both
      electronic health records and the clinical microbiology laboratory. Overall, 534 
      patients with S aureus bacteremia were identified and 118 (22.1%) had an SPBCB.
      Among cases with an SPBCB, 106 (89.8%) were classified as clinically significant 
      whereas 12 (10.2%) were considered contaminated or of unclear significance. A
      majority (92.4%) of patients received antibiotic therapy, but patients with
      clinically significant bacteremia were treated with longer courses (25.9 vs 5.7
      days, P < .001). Significant differences in both frequency of echocardiography
      (65.1% vs 84.6%, P < .001) and infective endocarditis diagnosis (3.8% vs 14.2%, P
      = .002) were seen in those with an SPBCB compared to those with multiple positive
      bottles. A longer hospital length of stay and higher 90-day, 6-month, and 1-year 
      mortality rates were seen in patients with multiple positive blood culture
      bottles. An SPBCB with S aureus was common among our patients. While this
      syndrome has a more favorable prognosis as compared to those with multiple
      positive blood cultures, clinicians should remain concerned as it portends a risk
      of infective endocarditis and mortality.

TI  - Risk of Multidrug Resistant Bacteria Acquisition in Patients with Declared
      beta-Lactam Allergy during Hospitalization in Intensive Care Unit: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study (2007-2018).
PG  - 8906316
LID - 10.1155/2022/8906316 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The risk of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) bacterial
      acquisition in patients with beta-lactam allergy has been poorly investigated. In
      a previous study conducted over a 6-year long period (2007-2012), we found that
      patients with declared beta-lactam allergy had a higher risk of ESBL bacterial
      carriage at admission in intensive care unit (ICU), but they had not a higher
      risk of ESBL bacterial acquisition. We present the final results of the study
      which was eventually conducted over a 12-year long period (2007-2018). Materials 
      and Methods: The study included all patients admitted in ICU and receiving
      antibiotic treatment from January 2007 to December 2018. ESBL bacterial
      acquisition was the main clinical outcome. Mortality in ICU, multidrug resistant 
      bacterial carriage at admission and discharge were the secondary outcomes.
      Results: Overall, 3332 patients were included, 132/3332 (3.9%) were labelled
      beta-lactam allergic, while 3200/3332 (96.1%) did not presented beta-lactam
      allergy. No significant difference in rates of ESBL acquisition was detected
      (4/132, 3% vs. 78/3200, 2.4%; p = 0.17). Patients with beta-lactam allergy had
      higher rates of ESBL bacterial carriage at admission (19/132, 14.4% vs. 248/3200,
      7.8%, p = 0.01) and at discharge (22/132, 16.7% vs. 351/3200, 11%, p = 0.04) than
      nonallergic patients. No differences in mortality, duration of hospitalization,
      and carriage of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus were reported. Female
      gender was the only factor associated with beta-lactam allergy at the
      multivariate analysis. Conclusions: This study confirms that patients with
      declared beta-lactam allergy had not a higher risk of ESBL bacterial acquisition

      at admission.

PG  - 1736
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-5834 [doi]
AB  - Background: Bacterial contamination still poses serious challenges to blood
      safety. Platelets have the highest bacterial contamination risk of all blood
      components. Methods: Twenty units of manual platelets were prepared from blood
      donated by our hospital, which were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus and
      Escherichia coli suspensions. The riboflavin sodium phosphate solution was added 
      into platelets, adjusted to a final concentration of 160 mumol/L. Platelets added
      into an illumination bag and placed in the inactivation system for riboflavin
      photochemistry at various doses. The inactivation effect of bacteria was
      evaluated on a Columbia blood agar plate by the plate counting method. Meanwhile,
      the blood routine, blood gas analysis, platelet aggregation test, and
      thromboelastogram of platelets before and after treatment were detected to
      evaluate the changes of platelet quality after treatment. Results: the
      inactivation effect of S. aureus and E. coli at the inactivation dose (16.9
      J/cm(2)) could reach more than 4 logs. After treatment at 16.9 J/cm(2), the blood
      routine results showed that the platelet count was significantly different
      (P<0.05), and the blood gas analysis showed that the oxygen partial pressure
      (pO2) and lactic acid concentration (cLac) were also significantly different
      (P<0.05). After 16.9 J/cm(2) treatment, there was a significant difference
      between Arachidonic acid (AA) and Collagen (Cog) activator groups in the platelet
      aggregation experiment (P<0.05), but there was no significant difference in the
      main thrombelastogram (TEG) parameters (R value, K value, angle value, MA value) 
      after treatment (P>0.05). Conclusions: The inactivation effect of this set of
      blood component pathogen inactivation system on platelet bacterial contamination 
      could be considered to meet actual clinical needs, with the inactivation
      treatment having little impact on platelet function.

TI  - Identifying the clinical presentations, progression, and sequela of pelvic
      inflammatory disease through physiological, histological and ultrastructural
      evaluation of a rat animal model.
PG  - 1710
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-3345 [doi]
AB  - Background: Patients with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are at an increased
      risk of ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and varying degrees of chronic pelvic
      pain. The aims of this study were to establish a rat model of PID and
      characterize its progression in order to assist in the study of
      pathophysiological mechanisms and to provide animal model for future studies of
      PID treatments. Methods: Fifty Sprague-Dawley rats (female, 6-weeks-old) were
      divided into a model group (n=28) and a control group (n=22). The rat endometrium
      was mechanically injured by a needle which moved back and forth 3 times on the
      endometrial tissue, and a mixed bacterial solution (6x10(8) CFU) of equal
      concentrations of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was injected into
      both horns of the rat uterus. Physiological characteristics including weight,
      temperature, blood, and inflammatory factors were compared, and
      immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy were used to evaluate
      the progress and sequela of PID. Results: The model rats experienced acute PID in
      the first 14 days and exhibited higher body temperatures and decreased body
      weight. Infection-related factors in the blood were also significantly changed
      compared with the normal group, with obviously increased serum levels of
      C-reactive protein (CRP), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and interleukin-4 (IL-4).
      Congestion and edema were observed in the uteri of the model rats, followed by
      infiltration of numerous inflammatory cells and ultrastructural morphology
      changes. Histological examination of the uterus showed that adhesion initially
      appeared at approximately 21 days. In addition to the increased collagen fibers
      biomass, the expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) was
      elevated, which might have contributed to pelvic tissue adhesion formation in the
      PID sequela. Conclusions: This study clearly described the characteristics and
      progression of PID in a rat model. The detailed evidence increased our
      understanding of the pathogenesis and progression of PID and may be useful for
      future studies of PID treatments.

PG  - 824042
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2021.824042 [doi]
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that is
      characterized by recurrent and chronic infections of the lung predominantly by
      the opportunistic pathogens, Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and
      Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While S. aureus is the main colonizing
      bacteria of the CF lungs during infancy and early childhood, its incidence
      declines thereafter and infections by P. aeruginosa become more prominent with
      increasing age. The competitive and cooperative interactions exhibited by these
      two pathogens influence their survival, antibiotic susceptibility, persistence
      and, consequently the disease progression. For instance, P. aeruginosa secretes
      small respiratory inhibitors like hydrogen cyanide, pyocyanin and quinoline
      N-oxides that block the electron transport pathway and suppress the growth of S. 
      aureus. However, S. aureus survives this respiratory attack by adapting to
      respiration-defective small colony variant (SCV) phenotype. SCVs cause persistent
      and recurrent infections and are also resistant to antibiotics, especially
      aminoglycosides, antifolate antibiotics, and to host antimicrobial peptides such 
      as LL-37, human beta-defensin (HBD) 2 and HBD3; and lactoferricin B. The
      interaction between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus is multifaceted. In mucoid P.
      aeruginosa strains, siderophores and rhamnolipids are downregulated thus
      enhancing the survival of S. aureus. Conversely, protein A from S. aureus
      inhibits P. aeruginosa biofilm formation while protecting both P. aeruginosa and 
      S. aureus from phagocytosis by neutrophils. This review attempts to summarize the
      current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive the competitive and 
      cooperative interactions between S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in the CF lungs that
      could influence the disease outcome.

      hospital of Nepal.
PG  - 236-245
LID - 10.4103/ijciis.ijciis_7_21 [doi]
AB  - Background: Patients at intensive care units (ICUs) are vulnerable to acquiring
      nosocomial infections. The main objective of this study was to explore and
      characterize the burden of nosocomial infections from an ICU of National Medical 
      College and Teaching Hospital (NMCTH), Birgunj, Nepal. Methods: A prospective
      hospital-based study was conducted between April and December 2018 at NMCTH,
      Birgunj, Province 2, of Nepal. A total of 374 specimens including clinical
      specimens (n = 190) from patients admitted in an ICU and animate and inanimate
      environmental samples (n = 184) from the ICU were collected. Collected specimens 
      were cultured in specific microbiological media, and microbial isolates were
      identified and subjected to antibiotic susceptibility test. Results: Altogether, 
      374 specimens (190 clinical specimens and 184 nonclinical) of an ICU were
      analyzed. Out of 190 clinical specimens, 51% (97/190) showed bacterial growth.
      Isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (33%; 32/97), Escherichia coli
      (20.6%; 20/97), Klebsiella spp. (15.5%; 15/97), Pseudomonas spp. (11.3%; 11/97), 
      and Acinetobacter spp. (11.3%; 11/97). Out of 184 nonclinical specimens, 51.6%
      (95/184) of the samples showed microbial growth. Among the isolates, Klebsiella
      spp. predominated (30.6%; 26/85) the growth, followed by S. aureus (22.4%;
      19/85), Acinetobacter spp. (21.2%; 18/85), and Pseudomonas spp. (17.6%; 15/85).
      Among all clinical and nonclinical isolates, 61.9% (60/97) of the clinical
      specimens and 65.9% (56/85) of the nonclinical specimens showed multidrug
      resistance (MDR). Conclusion: Two-thirds of the specimens from both clinical and 
      nonclinical specimens showed MDR. Urgent actions are required to address the
      augmented rate of nosocomial infections and MDR bacteria among ICUs in Nepal.

TI  - Treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection following
      tibial plateau leveling osteotomy in a dog.
PG  - 728-733

AB  - Background: In recent years, surgical site infections caused by drug-resistant
      pathogens have emerged as a cause of concern in small animal practice. In this
      report, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections associated 
      with tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) is reported. However, there have
      been no reports on the treatment of MRSA infection following TPLO in dogs. This
      case report describes the use of a combination of vancomycin and rifampicin to
      treat MRSA infection following TPLO in a dog. Case Description: A 7-year-old
      spayed female American cocker spaniel was referred for right hind limb lameness
      that did not improve with conservative treatment. The dog was diagnosed with
      cranial cruciate ligament rupture, for which TPLO was performed. Once the
      surgical wound was closed, the dog licked the skin on the surgical site, causing 
      the injury to dehisce. MRSA was detected from the purulent discharge, and
      chloramphenicol was then administered based on the drug sensitivity test results.
      Because of the continued drainage, the implants were removed after the bone union
      of the osteotomy site was observed. Since this did not provide any relief to the 
      existing condition, the antibiotic was changed to vancomycin at 132 days after
      TPLO surgery, and the infected location was cleaned many times through a drain
      tube placed into the tibia. However, the infection could not be controlled. Thus,
      a rifampicin and vancomycin combination was started. As a result, the purulent
      discharge disappeared and the fistula entirely closed on the 154th day after TPLO
      surgery. Conclusion: A combination of rifampicin and vancomycin may be effective 
      for treating MRSA infection at the surgical site following TPLO surgery that does
      not heal despite implant removal and administration of vancomycin.

      bananamide C.
PG  - 35

AB  - A fluorescence and biosurfactant-producing strain HN3-2 was isolated from a
      rhizosphere soil sample of wheat plants and the chromosome of the strain HN3-2
      was sequenced and was analyzed by multiple bioinformatics tools in this study.
      The genome size of the strain HN3-2 is 6,441,476 bp, with a GC content of 60.54%.
      16Sr RNA-based phylogeny analysis showed that the strain HN3-2 belongs to
      Pseudomonas koreensis subgroup in Pseudomonas species. Preliminary data from
      genome mining have showed that the strain Pseudomonas sp. HN3-2 is capable of
      producing a peptide-type metabolite. Solid-phase extraction, reversed-phase high 
      performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) together with liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry, high-resolution mass spectrometry and tandem
      mass spectrometry analysis have led to the purification and identification of a
      cyclic lipopeptide (CLP) bananamide C (1) from the fermentative broth of the
      strain Pseudomonas sp. HN3-2. Moreover, the biological activity tests showed that
      banananmide 3 displays moderate antagonistic activity against Staphylococcus
      aureus and Escherichia coli. Collectively, these results provide the possibility 
      of developing the CLP bananamide C as a drug leads for medical applications.

AB  - Hip adductor muscle abscesses that descend from an infected symphysis pubis are
      rare but cause serious morbidity. We present a case of a 73-year-old male patient
      with unilateral hip adductor muscle abscess that descended from septic
      symphysitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Surgical debridement of the adductor
      compartment could not clear the infection and secondary debridement of the
      symphysis was necessary to eradicate S. aureus. Additionally, we review another
      four cases with similarities to our case comparing their investigation,
      treatment, and outcome.

      with HIV and healthy people in Kathmandu, Nepal.
PG  - FSO769
LID - 10.2144/fsoa-2021-0103 [doi]
AB  - Aim: This study aimed to compare methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA) nasal colonization in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and healthy people
      from Kathmandu. Methods: MRSA isolated from 400 nasal swabs was screened using a 
      cefoxitin disc and confirmed by the presence of the mecA gene. Results: MRSA
      nasal carriers among the PLHIV and control cohorts were 3.5% (7 out of 200) and
      5.0% (10 out of 200), respectively. All the MRSA from PLHIV and most of MRSA from
      healthy controls were PVL positive. Longer duration of antiretroviral therapy
      significantly reduces the risk of MRSA nasal colonization in PLHIV. Conclusion:
      There is no significant difference in MRSA nasal colonization in PLHIV and
      healthy controls in this study region.

PG  - 811
LID - 10.4081/mrm.2021.811 [doi]
AB  - Background: This study compared the prevalence of common microorganisms in
      obstructed and non-obstructed cases across the four quarters on the first
      post-tracheostomy year. Methods: A retrospective chart review of the
      microbiological profiles of all adult patients who underwent a tracheostomy was
      conducted between June 2015 and September 2019 at our hospital. Based on the
      tracheostomy indications, patients were allocated to obstructed or non-obstructed
      group. Any patient with at least one positive sample was followed up quarterly
      for a year. The first culture result obtained was recorded at least one month
      following the last antibiotic dose in each quarter. Results: Out of the 65
      tracheal aspirate results obtained from 58 patients (mean age, 57.5+/-16.48
      years), the most common procedure and indications were surgical tracheostomy
      (72.4%) and non-obstructed causes (74.1%), respectively. Moreover, 47.7% of the
      culture results indicated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which showed significantly
      different proportions across the quarters (p=0.006). Among obstructed patients,
      P. aeruginosa was the most common (35%), followed by methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; 23.5%). Conclusions: The most common
      post-tracheostomy microorganism was P. aeruginosa. MRSA showed a strong
      association with tracheostomy for obstructive indications.

TI  - Pott's disease associated with psoas abscess: Case report.
PG  - 103239
LID - 10.1016/j.amsu.2021.103239 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Extrapulmonary tuberculosis may develop in any organ system,
      including the spine. The affection of spinal cord is called Pott's disease and it
      is the most frequent set. Pott's disease can present as back pain and be related 
      to complications such psoas muscle abscess. Case presentation: We report a case
      of 23-year-old Brazilian woman, natural from Amazonas, presenting with psoas
      abscess associated to Pott's disease treated with surgical debridement and
      drainage and extended tuberculosis scheme. Discussion: Psoas abscess is rare and 
      the main agents related to psoas abscess are Staphylococcus aureus, followed by
      Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. Retrofascial abscesses usually originate from
      bone lesions, including spine tuberculosis as our case, or due to contiguity of
      the retroperitoneal space. Conclusion: Psoas abscess related to Pott's disease is
      a difficult diagnosis, requiring high suspicious and proper investigation through
      good anamnesis, CT scan and culture.

AB  - Atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI) seriously threatens the health of the
      senile patients, and the strategies are urgent for the diagnosis and treatment of
      ACI. This study investigated the mRNA profiling of the patients with ischemic
      stroke and atherosclerosis via excavating the datasets in the GEO database and
      attempted to reveal the biomarkers and molecular mechanism of ACI. In this study,
      GES16561 and GES100927 were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database,
      and the related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed with R
      language. Furthermore, the DEGs were analyzed with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Besides, the
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was analyzed by STRING database
      and Cytoscape. The results showed that 133 downregulated DEGs and 234 upregulated
      DEGs were found in GES16561, 25 downregulated DEGs and 104 upregulated DEGs were 
      found in GSE100927, and 6 common genes were found in GES16561 and GES100927. GO
      enrichment analysis showed that the functional models of the common genes were
      involved in neutrophil activation, neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil
      activation, and immune response. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs in
      both GSE100927 and GSE16561 were connected with the pathways including Cell
      adhesion molecules (CAMs), Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Phagosome,
      Antigen processing and presentation, and Staphylococcus aureus infection. The PPI
      network analysis showed that 9 common DEGs were found in GSE100927 and GSE16561, 
      and a cluster with 6 nodes and 12 edges was also identified by PPI network
      analysis. In conclusion, this study suggested that FCGR3A and MAPK pathways were 
      connected with ACI.

TI  - Study of Cell Viability and Etiology of Contamination in Decalcified Bone
      Allograft: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 16-23
LID - 10.1007/s43465-021-00410-9 [doi]
AB  - Background: Bone allografts can elicit immune responses which is correlated with 
      the presence of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) and cellular DNA. It also has risk 
      of causing occult infection arising out of contamination during its processing
      and storage. The presence of immunogenic materials like cells, cellular remnants 
      and DNA in a decalcified bone allograft during different phases of processing has
      never been studied. Present study was conducted to explore- the cell viability
      using routine Hematoxylin and Eosin, presence of DNA using Feulgen staining and
      etiology of contamination in decalcified bone allograft during procurement,
      demineralization and ethanol preservation. Methods: The harvested bones from
      patients undergoing hemireplacement/THR/TKR were processed to prepare decalcified
      bone allografts. The samples during procurement (A), HCL treatment (B) and
      ethanol preservation (C) were sent for histopathological analysis (number of
      osteocytes in the maximum density field under 40x and the cells demonstrating
      presence of DNA on feulgen stain) and microbiological assessment
      (aerobic/anaerobic/fungal cultures). Results: Histopathological study
      demonstrated the presence of osteocytes and other cells like bone marrow,
      adipocytes, endothelial cells in the decal bone allograft. The average number of 
      osteocytes gradually decreased from 55.47, 9.6, 0.86 in sample A, B, C,
      respectively. Feulgen staining confirmed the presence of DNA in osteocytes and
      other cells which decreased both qualitatively and quantitatively in subsequent
      stages of processing. Rate of contamination demonstrated at the procurement was
      6.67% (Staphylococcus aureus). After treatment with HCl (demineralisation), 7.14%
      of non-contaminated allografts were found contaminated (Staphylococcus
      epidermidis). None of the remaining 13 non-contaminated allografts showed
      contamination after storage in ethanol. Overall 13% of the patients had positive 
      cultures on microbiological assessment. Conclusion: The population of osteocytes 
      in the harvested bone reduced significantly after processing with HCl and ethanol
      preservation. Presence of DNA, demonstrated by using Feulgen staining, was
      observed in bone marrow cells, adipocytes along with osteocytes which showed
      quantitative reduction on processing. Hence, antigenicity, conferred by cells and
      their DNA, reduced significantly after processing of decal bone. Contamination
      rate of banked decalcified allograft was 13%. Thus, culture and sensitivity tests
      should be carried out at each step of processing of decal bone allograft.

TI  - Molecular Mechanism of Traditional Chinese Ointment of Xuzhou Qufu Shengji in
      Infected Wounds.
PG  - 4116563
LID - 10.1155/2022/4116563 [doi]
AB  - Background: Xuzhou Qufu Shengji Ointment (QFSJO) has been used in hospital and
      private medication for more than 30 years to treat the infective wounds after
      trauma. However, molecular investigation is lacking. This study used rats to
      explore the healing mechanism of QFSJO in promoting wound healing in human.
      Methods: One circular incision was individually generated on the back of 30 rats 
      in three groups and challenged with 10(8) CFU (0.3 mL) of Staphylococcus aureus. 
      Then, one of the trauma groups was treated with QFSJO gauze, and the control
      group was covered with a piece of Vaseline gauze, while the western medicine
      group was treated with erythromycin in a similar way. The dressing change of all 
      the groups was performed once a day for three weeks. The anti-inflammation and
      proangiogenesis of QFSJO were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA). The levels of angiogenesis associated factors, vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), hydroxyproline, 
      and hemoglobin, were measured according to ELISA. The immunohistochemistry of
      CD31 and CD34 expression in granulation tissue was demonstrated and
      quantitatively analyzed for angiogenesis in granulation tissue in sites. Results:
      A faster wound healing ratio was observed in QFSJO-dressing-treated group than
      Vaseline- and erythrocin-treated groups. ELISA results showed that QFSJO promoted
      VEGF and b-FGF levels significantly in early stage of wound healing. QFSJO
      dressing group also showed an enhanced hydroxyproline and hemoglobin in
      granulation tissue. The expressions of CD31 and CD34 in granulation tissue of
      QFSJO group were higher than in the Vaseline and erythrocin groups. Conclusion:
      QFSJO improved the healing rate of the infective wounds by promoting the
      angiogenesis of granulation tissue and inhibiting the inflammation of the trauma 
      tissue. Our finding suggests that QFSJO is able to help angiogenic capillary
      sprouts for collagen accumulates in the granulation tissue.

AB  - To monitor national antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the Korea Global AMR
      Surveillance System (Kor-GLASS) was established. This study analyzed bloodstream 
      infection (BSI) cases from Kor-GLASS phase I from January 2017 to December 2019. 
      Nine non-duplicated Kor-GLASS target pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, 
      Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae,
      Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter
      spp., and Salmonella spp., were isolated from blood specimens from eight sentinel
      hospitals. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, AMR genotyping, and strain
      typing were carried out. Among the 20,041 BSI cases, 15,171 cases were caused by 
      one of the target pathogens, and 12,578 blood isolates were collected for the
      study. Half (1,059/2,134) of S. aureus isolates were resistant to cefoxitin, and 
      38.1% (333/873) of E. faecium isolates were resistant to vancomycin.
      Beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin-resistant and penicillin-resistant E.
      faecalis isolates by disk diffusion method were identified, but the isolates were
      confirmed as ampicillin-susceptible by broth microdilution method. Among E. coli,
      an increasing number of isolates carried the bla CTX-M-27 gene, and the ertapenem
      resistance in 1.4% (30/2,110) of K. pneumoniae isolates was mostly (23/30)
      conferred by K. pneumoniae carbapenemases. A quarter (108/488) of P. aeruginosa
      isolates were resistant to meropenem, and 30.5% (33/108) of those carried
      acquired carbapenemase genes. Over 90% (542/599) of A. baumannii isolates were
      imipenem-resistant, and all except one harbored the bla OXA-23 gene. Kor-GLASS
      provided comprehensive AMR surveillance data, and the defined molecular
      mechanisms of resistance helped us to better understand AMR epidemiology.
      Comparative analysis with other GLASS-enrolled countries is possible owing to the
      harmonized system provided by GLASS.

TI  - Human Milk Oligosaccharides Exhibit Biofilm Eradication Activity Against Matured 
      Biofilms Formed by Different Pathogen Species.

AB  - Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have been shown to exhibit plenty of benefits 
      for infants, such as prebiotic activity shaping the gut microbiota and
      immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activity. For some pathogenic bacteria,
      antimicrobial activity has been proved, but most studies focus on group B
      streptococci. In the present study, we investigated the antimicrobial and
      antibiofilm activities of the total and fractionated HMOs from pooled human milk 
      against four common human pathogenic Gram-negative species (Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Burkholderia
      cenocepacia) and three Gram-positive species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus
      faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis). The activity of HMOs against enterococci and
      B. cenocepacia are addressed here for the first time. We showed that HMOs exhibit
      a predominant activity against the Gram-positive species, with E. faecalis being 
      the most sensitive to the HMOs, both in planktonic bacteria and in biofilms. In
      further tests, we could exclude fucosyllactose as the antibacterial component.
      The biological significance of these findings may lie in the prevention of skin
      infections of the mother's breast as a consequence of breastfeeding-induced skin 
      laceration and/or protection of the infants' nasopharynx and lung from
      respiratory pathogens such as staphylococci.

TI  - Mutations in the Phenicol Exporter Gene fexA Impact Resistance Levels in Three
      Bacterial Hosts According to Susceptibility Testing and Protein Modeling.
PG  - 794435
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2021.794435 [doi]
AB  - The prototype fexA gene confers combined resistance to chloramphenicol and
      florfenicol. However, fexA variants mediating resistance only to chloramphenicol 
      have been identified, such as in the case of a Staphylococcus aureus isolate
      recovered from poultry meat illegally imported to Germany. The effects of the
      individual mutations detected in the fexA sequence of this isolate were
      investigated in this study. A total of 11 fexA variants, including prototype fexA
      and variants containing the different previously described mutations either alone
      or in different combinations, were generated by on-chip gene synthesis and
      site-directed mutagenesis. The constructs were inserted into a shuttle vector and
      transformed into three recipient strains (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
      aureus, and Salmonella Typhimurium). Subsequently, minimal inhibitory
      concentrations (MIC) of florfenicol and chloramphenicol were determined. In
      addition, protein modeling was used to predict the structural effects of the
      mutations. The lack of florfenicol-resistance mediating properties of the fexA
      variants could be attributed to the presence of a C110T and/or G98C mutation.
      Transformants carrying fexA variants containing either of these mutations, or
      both, showed a reduction of florfenicol MICs compared to those transformants
      carrying prototype fexA or any of the other variants. The significance of these
      mutations was supported by the generated protein models, indicating a
      substitution toward more voluminous amino-acids in the substrate-binding site of 
      FexA. The remaining mutations, A391G and C961A, did not result in lower
      florfenicol-resistance compared to prototype fexA.

TI  - Insight Into the Anti-staphylococcal Activity of JBC 1847 at Sub-Inhibitory
      Concentration.
PG  - 786173
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2021.786173 [doi]
AB  - Multidrug-resistant pathogens constitute a serious global issue and, therefore,
      novel antimicrobials with new modes of action are urgently needed. Here, we
      investigated the effect of a phenothiazine derivative (JBC 1847) with high
      antimicrobial activity on Staphylococcus aureus, using a wide range of in vitro
      assays, flow cytometry, and RNA transcriptomics. The flow cytometry results
      showed that JBC 1847 rapidly caused depolarization of the cell membrane, while
      the macromolecule synthesis inhibition assay showed that the synthesis rates of
      DNA, RNA, cell wall, and proteins, respectively, were strongly decreased.
      Transcriptome analysis of S. aureus exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of
      JBC 1847 identified a total of 78 downregulated genes, whereas not a single gene 
      was found to be significantly upregulated. Most importantly, there was
      downregulation of genes involved in adenosintrifosfat (ATP)-dependent pathways,
      including histidine biosynthesis, which is likely to correlate with the observed 
      lower level of intracellular ATP in JBC 1847-treated cells. Furthermore, we
      showed that JBC 1847 is bactericidal against both exponentially growing cells and
      cells in a stationary growth phase. In conclusion, our results showed that the
      antimicrobial properties of JBC 1847 were primarily caused by depolarization of
      the cell membrane resulting in dissipation of the proton motive force (PMF),
      whereby many essential bacterial processes are affected. JBC 1847 resulted in
      lowered intracellular levels of ATP followed by decreased macromolecule synthesis
      rate and downregulation of genes essential for the amino acid metabolism in S.
      aureus. Bacterial compensatory mechanisms for this proposed multi-target activity
      of JBC 1847 seem to be limited based on the observed very low frequency of
      resistance toward the compound.

      of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 770657
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2021.770657 [doi]
AB  - The resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has
      augmented due to the abuse of antibiotics, bringing about difficulties in the
      treatment of infection especially with the formation of biofilm. Thus, it is
      essential to develop antimicrobials. Here we synthesized a novel small-molecule
      compound, which we termed SYG-180-2-2 (C21H16N2OSe), that had antibiofilm
      activity. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the antibiofilm effect of
      SYG-180-2-2 against clinical MRSA isolates at a subinhibitory concentration (4
      mug/ml). In this study, it was showed that significant suppression in biofilm
      formation occurred with SYG-180-2-2 treatment, the inhibition ranged between 65.0
      and 85.2%. Subsequently, confocal laser scanning microscopy and a bacterial
      biofilm metabolism activity assay further demonstrated that SYG-180-2-2 could
      suppress biofilm. Additionally, SYG-180-2-2 reduced bacterial adhesion and
      polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) production. It was found that the
      expression of icaA and other biofilm-related genes were downregulated as
      evaluated by RT-qPCR. At the same time, icaR and codY were upregulated when
      biofilms were treated with SYG-180-2-2. Based on the above results, we speculate 
      that SYG-180-2-2 inhibits the formation of biofilm by affecting cell adhesion and
      the expression of genes related to PIA production. Above all, SYG-180-2-2 had no 
      toxic effects on human normal alveolar epithelial cells BEAS-2B. Collectively,
      the small-molecule compound SYG-180-2-2 is a safe and effective antibacterial
      agent for inhibiting MRSA biofilm.

      in Juvenile Horseshoe Crab Tachypleus tridentatus.
PG  - 813582
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2021.813582 [doi]
AB  - Anthropogenic elevation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) drives global-scale
      ocean acidification (OA), which has aroused widespread concern for marine
      ecosystem health. The tri-spine horseshoe crab (HSC) Tachypleus tridentatus has
      been facing the threat of population depletion for decades, and the effects of OA
      on the physiology and microbiology of its early life stage are unclear. In this
      study, the 1st instar HSC larvae were exposed to acidified seawater (pH 7.3, pH
      8.1 as control) for 28 days to determine the effects of OA on their growth,
      molting, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota. Results showed that there were no 
      significant differences in growth index and molting rate between OA group and
      control group, but the chitinase activity, beta-NAGase activity, and ecdysone
      content in OA group were significantly lower than those of the control group.
      Compared to the control group, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde 
      (MDA) contents in OA group were significantly increased at the end of the
      experiment. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and alkaline phosphatase 
      (AKP) activities increased first and then decreased, glutathione peroxidase (GPX)
      decreased first and then increased, and GST activity changed little during the
      experiment. According to the result of 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota,
      microbial-mediated functions predicted by PICRUSt showed that "Hematopoietic cell
      lineage," "Endocytosis," "Staphylococcus aureus infection," and "Shigellosis"
      pathways significantly increased in OA group. The above results indicate that OA 
      had no significant effect on growth index and molting rate but interfered with
      the activity of chitinolytic enzymes and ecdysone expression of juvenile
      horseshoe crabs, and caused oxidative stress. In addition, OA had adverse effects
      on the immune defense function and intestinal health. The present study reveals
      the potential threat of OA to T. tridentatus population and lays a foundation for
      the further study of the physiological adaptation mechanism of juvenile horseshoe
      crabs to environmental change.

TI  - TmIKKepsilon Is Required to Confer Protection Against Gram-Negative Bacteria, E. 
      coli by the Regulation of Antimicrobial Peptide Production in the Tenebrio
      molitor Fat Body.
PG  - 758862

AB  - The inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) kinase (IKK) is the core
      regulator of the NF-kappaB pathway against pathogenic invasion in vertebrates or 
      invertebrates. IKKbeta, -epsilon and -gamma have pivotal roles in the Toll and
      immune deficiency (IMD) pathways. In this study, a homolog of IKKepsilon
      (TmIKKepsilon) was identified from Tenebrio molitor RNA sequence database and
      functionally characterized for its role in regulating immune signaling pathways
      in insects. The TmIKKepsilon gene is characterized by two exons and one intron
      comprising an open reading frame (ORF) of 2,196 bp that putatively encodes a
      polypeptide of 731 amino acid residues. TmIKKepsilon contains a serine/threonine 
      protein kinases catalytic domain. Phylogenetic analysis established the close
      homology of TmIKKepsilon to Tribolium castaneum IKKepsilon (TcIKKepsilon) and its
      proximity with other IKK-related kinases. The expression of TmIKKepsilon mRNA was
      elevated in the gut, integument, and hemocytes of the last-instar larva and the
      fat body, Malpighian tubules, and testis of 5-day-old adults. TmIKKepsilon
      expression was significantly induced by Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, 
      and Candida albicans challenge in whole larvae and tissues, such as hemocytes,
      gut, and fat body. The knockdown of the TmIKKepsilon messenger RNA (mRNA)
      expression significantly reduced the survival of the larvae against microbial
      challenges. Further, we investigated the induction patterns of 14 T. molitor
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) genes in TmIKKepsilon gene-silencing model after
      microbial challenges. While in hemocytes, the transcriptional regulation of most 
      AMPs was negatively regulated in the gut and fat body tissue of T. molitor, AMPs,
      such as TmTenecin 1, TmTenecin 4, TmDefensin, TmColeoptericin A, TmColeoptericin 
      B, TmAttacin 1a, and TmAttacin 2, were positively regulated in
      TmIKKepsilon-silenced individuals after microbial challenge. Collectively, the
      results implicate TmIKKepsilon as an important factor in antimicrobial innate
      immune responses in T. molitor.

AB  - Sea cucumbers are marine organisms with uses in food, cosmetics, and medicine.
      This study aimed to identify Indonesian sea cucumbers with high antioxidant and
      antibacterial activities. Twenty-one sea cucumber species were used for this
      study. Antioxidant capacity was evaluated using the
      2,2-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazine assay. Antibacterial activity was assessed
      using the disk diffusion assay, whereas the resazurin-based assay was employed to
      determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal
      concentration (MBC). Volatile compounds possibly related to the biological
      activity of sea cucumbers were analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 
      (GC-MS). Holothuria atra had the strongest antioxidant capacity (IC50 = 14.22 +/-
      0.87 microg microL(-1)). Stichopus vastus displayed the best antibacterial
      activity against Staphylococcus aureus, whereas Stichopus ocellatus extract was
      most potent against Vibrio cholerae. Holothuria albiventer, which controlled
      Bacillus subtilis most effectively while also being active against S. aureus and 
      V. cholerae, was the optimal antimicrobial species. H. albiventer and Actinopyga 
      echinites inhibited B. subtilis growth at 12.5 microg microL(-1). The MBC tests
      indicated that the antibacterial activities of sea cucumbers at the MIC were
      bacteriostatic, rather than bactericidal, in nature. GC-MS analysis uncovered
      long-chain fatty acids that might be associated with the antibacterial activities
      of sea cucumbers.

TI  - Surgical versus medical management of infective endocarditis after TAVR.
LID - 10.1002/ccd.30087 [doi]
AB  - We assessed the incidence of aortic valve surgery intervention in the treatment
      of infective endocarditis (IE) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement
      (TAVR) and compared the characteristics and outcomes of surgical intervention
      versus medical management alone in this cohort using a nationwide data set. We
      identified all the hospitalizations in patients undergoing TAVR who developed IE 
      within 1-year (i.e., early IE) of the procedure from 2014 to 2017 using the
      Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD). The primary outcomes of the study were
      in-hospital mortality. A total of 906 hospitalizations were identified for IE
      amongst the TAVR patients from 2014 to 2017 of which 20 (2.21%) underwent aortic 
      valve surgery during the hospitalization. Patients undergoing surgery were
      younger, more likely to have Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, cardiogenic
      shock, and acute kidney injury (AKI) during the hospitalization. There were no
      significant differences in in-hospital mortality (9.9% vs. 12.4%, p = 0.824;
      adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.26 (0.01-1.58), p = 0.223) and 30-day readmissions. 
      However, the length of stay and hospitalization costs were higher in surgical
      intervention group. The important predictors of in-hospital mortality in
      TAVR-related IE patients were dialysis during IE hospitalization, AKI,
      cardiogenic shock, Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, stroke, and female sex.
      The utilization of surgical management for IE post-TAVR during the index
      hospitalization is low, and there is no significant mortality benefit with
      surgical intervention as compared with the medical management.

AB  - Contezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibiotic with good antibacterial activity
      against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus. For the purpose to further characterize the pharmacokinetics of
      contezolid and its major metabolite M2, accurate and rapid ultra-performance
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric assays (UPLC-MS/MS) were
      developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of contezolid and M2 in
      human plasma and urine. The plasma samples were pretreated by liquid-liquid
      extraction. The automated solid phase extraction method was used to preprocess
      urine samples. ACQUITY UPLC(R) BEH C8 (2.1 mm x 100 mm, 1.7 microm) column was
      used to separate the analytes with a gradient mobile phase of acetonitrile and
      water at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The calibration curves showed good linearity 
      over the concentration ranges of 0.0100-5.00 microg/mL for contezolid in plasma
      and urine, 0.00200-1.00 microg/mL in plasma and 0.0200-10.0 microg/mL in urine
      for M2, respectively. For both plasma and urine assays, the intra- and
      inter-batch accuracy and precision were within 15% for all quality control
      levels, including the lower limit of quantitation. The methods were fully
      validated and successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of contezolid
      tablets in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.

AB  - Industrial metal ion pollution has been considered the chief source of water
      contaminants all over the world. In the present research, we have prepared gum
      tragacanth cross-linked 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-acrylamide
      (GT-cl-(HEMA-co-AAm)) hydrogel and gum tragacanth cross-linked 2-hydroxyethyl
      methacrylate-co-acrylamide/zinc oxide (GT-cl-(HEMA-co-AAm)/ZnO) hydrogel
      composite with better Hg(2+) adsorption capability. GT-cl-(HEMA-co-AAm)/ZnO
      hydrogel composite (154.8 mg g(-1)) exhibited higher Hg(2+) adsorption than
      GT-cl-(HEMA-co-AAm) hydrogel. To address the performance of GT-cl-(HEMA-co-AAm)
      hydrogel and GT-cl-(HEMA-co-AAm)/ZnO hydrogel composite, batch adsorption
      experiments were successfully conducted under different optimised conditions. At 
      last, in-vitro antibacterial activities of Hg(2+) loaded GT-cl-(HEMA-co-AAm) and 
      GT-cl-(HEMA-co-AAm)/ZnO were performed in two different well Staphylococcus
      aureus (gram-positive) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram-negative) bacteria. As a 
      positive control, ampicillin was employed against both types of bacteria. This
      methodology for the reusability of material has a great ecofriendly impression
      for minimising secondary waste derived from adsorption and can help design
      upgraded antibacterial agents.

TI  - Global burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance in 2019: a systematic
      analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a major threat to human health
      around the world. Previous publications have estimated the effect of AMR on
      incidence, deaths, hospital length of stay, and health-care costs for specific
      pathogen-drug combinations in select locations. To our knowledge, this study
      presents the most comprehensive estimates of AMR burden to date. METHODS: We
      estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to and
      associated with bacterial AMR for 23 pathogens and 88 pathogen-drug combinations 
      in 204 countries and territories in 2019. We obtained data from systematic
      literature reviews, hospital systems, surveillance systems, and other sources,
      covering 471 million individual records or isolates and 7585
      study-location-years. We used predictive statistical modelling to produce
      estimates of AMR burden for all locations, including for locations with no data. 
      Our approach can be divided into five broad components: number of deaths where
      infection played a role, proportion of infectious deaths attributable to a given 
      infectious syndrome, proportion of infectious syndrome deaths attributable to a
      given pathogen, the percentage of a given pathogen resistant to an antibiotic of 
      interest, and the excess risk of death or duration of an infection associated
      with this resistance. Using these components, we estimated disease burden based
      on two counterfactuals: deaths attributable to AMR (based on an alternative
      scenario in which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by drug-susceptible
      infections), and deaths associated with AMR (based on an alternative scenario in 
      which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by no infection). We generated 
      95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for final estimates as the 25th and 975th ordered
      values across 1000 posterior draws, and models were cross-validated for
      out-of-sample predictive validity. We present final estimates aggregated to the
      global and regional level. FINDINGS: On the basis of our predictive statistical
      models, there were an estimated 4.95 million (3.62-6.57) deaths associated with
      bacterial AMR in 2019, including 1.27 million (95% UI 0.911-1.71) deaths
      attributable to bacterial AMR. At the regional level, we estimated the all-age
      death rate attributable to resistance to be highest in western sub-Saharan
      Africa, at 27.3 deaths per 100 000 (20.9-35.3), and lowest in Australasia, at 6.5
      deaths (4.3-9.4) per 100 000. Lower respiratory infections accounted for more
      than 1.5 million deaths associated with resistance in 2019, making it the most
      burdensome infectious syndrome. The six leading pathogens for deaths associated
      with resistance (Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella 
      pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa) were responsible for 929 000 (660 000-1 270 000) deaths attributable 
      to AMR and 3.57 million (2.62-4.78) deaths associated with AMR in 2019. One
      pathogen-drug combination, meticillin-resistant S aureus, caused more than 100
      000 deaths attributable to AMR in 2019, while six more each caused 50 000-100 000
      deaths: multidrug-resistant excluding extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis,
      third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E coli, carbapenem-resistant A
      baumannii, fluoroquinolone-resistant E coli, carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae,
      and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant K pneumoniae. INTERPRETATION: To our
      knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive assessment of the global
      burden of AMR, as well as an evaluation of the availability of data. AMR is a
      leading cause of death around the world, with the highest burdens in low-resource
      settings. Understanding the burden of AMR and the leading pathogen-drug
      combinations contributing to it is crucial to making informed and
      location-specific policy decisions, particularly about infection prevention and
      control programmes, access to essential antibiotics, and research and development
      of new vaccines and antibiotics. There are serious data gaps in many low-income
      settings, emphasising the need to expand microbiology laboratory capacity and
      data collection systems to improve our understanding of this important human
      health threat. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, and
      Department of Health and Social Care using UK aid funding managed by the Fleming

AB  - Improving the treatment efficiency of sludge in Alexandria, Egypt, was studied to
      improve the primary and secondary sludge treatment efficiency, different doses
      ranging from 0.25 to 6 kGy of ionizing radiation were proposed and evaluated. The
      scope of This study is to assess the radiation-based treatment efficiency from
      physical, chemical, and biological perspectives and to compare between the
      conventional treatment method and the radiation-based treatment technology. To
      evaluate the performance of each treatment system, pH, oil and greases
      concentrations, total solid concentrations, BOD concentrations, COD
      concentrations, parasites, and microorganisms were assessed in the primary and
      secondary samples at different radiation doses (from 0.25 to 6 KGy), and in the
      conventionally treated samples. Irradiation by gamma radiation with a dose
      ranging from 0.25 to 6 kGy was efficient in reducing some of the physical
      contaminants. Oil & greases, Total Solids, BOD, COD concentrations were reduced
      significantly (p < 0.001) in a dose-dependent manner. Either primary or secondary
      sludge samples, total solid reduced significantly to about one-third of control
      concentration at six kGy. Six kGy able to reduce the BOD and COD concentrations
      in the primary sludge samples to that of the treated (after sludge dewatering)
      samples or less respectively and saved the secondary treatment stage. In primary 
      and secondary sludge samples culture, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio 
      spp were isolated as heavy growth on different culture media in the samples
      before radiation. After exposure to increasing doses of radiation, the number of 
      isolated organisms decreased, however, the growth of Proteus, Acinetobacter, and 
      vipro organisms was detected but in small numbers. No growth of any organism was 
      noted at 5 kGy. On the other hand, in the secondary sludge samples, Proteus was
      isolated as heavy growth before radiation and After exposure to increasing doses 
      of radiation, Moraxella spp. organisms were detected but in small numbers. By
      increasing the radiation doses, the free-living ciliates were decreased in the
      primary and secondary sludge samples. The free-living ciliates disappeared
      completely at 3 kGy. In the primary and secondary sludge samples, free-living
      ciliates reduction efficiency at 0.25 kGy was equivalent to the conventional
      treatment methods. So, we can conclude that radiation technology using Gamma rays
      at a dose higher than 5 kGy with a dose rate of 1.095 kGy/h is an effective
      technology for domestic and industrial waste sludge treatment from the
      environmental perspective and an experimental pilot plant study is required to
      optimize the cost of wastewater treatment through the use of irradiation
      technology.

AB  - The biosynthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles provides an excellent alternative
      to the chemical synthesis approach. The aim of the current study was a green and 
      eco-friendly synthesis of zirconium nanoparticles (ZrNPs) from fruit peels of
      Punica granatum (Pomegranate). The synthesis of ZrNPs was confirmed using a
      UV-visible spectrophotometer. The functional groups present on surface of ZrNPs
      were analyzed using FTIR. The average size of obtained ZrNPs was analyzed using
      SEM and DLS and it was around 20-60 nm. The antimicrobial activity of obtained
      ZrNPs was tested against Gram-positive strains (Bacillus subtilis and
      Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella
      pneumoniae) and Fungi (Aspergillus niger) by agar well diffusion method. ZrNPs
      showed maximum zone of inhibition against S. aureus (19 mm) and A. niger (18 mm) 
      at the maximum concentration of 200 mug/mL. The antioxidant scavenging activity
      of obtained ZrNPs was analyzed using the following methods: DPPH radical
      scavenging activity, Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, Ferric reducing
      antioxidant power and hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging activity. This the
      first and foremost study on ZrNPs synthesized using P. granatum fruit peel
      extract reporting their efficacy as antimicrobial agents against Bacteria and
      Fungi. Considering the tolerance of zirconium towards human body, it can also be 
      used as antimicrobial coating material on human implants.

TI  - Exploring the therapeutic potential of staphylococcal phage formulations: Current
      challenges and applications in phage therapy.
LID - 10.1111/jam.15462 [doi]
AB  - Unconstrained consumption of antibiotics throughout the expanse of the 21st
      century has resulted in increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among bacterial 
      pathogens, a transpiring predicament affecting the public healthcare sector. The 
      upsurge of multidrug-resistant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus,
      synchronously with the breakdown of the conventional antibiotic pipeline has led 
      to the exploration of alternate strategies. Phage therapy applications have thus 
      gained immense prominence among the scientific community to conquer this
      notorious pathogen associated with wide-ranging clinical manifestations,
      especially in immunosuppressed individuals. In this direction, a plethora of
      phage formulations like topical solutions, medicated dressings impregnated with
      phages, liposomal entrapments, etc., have been considered as an effective and
      upcoming strategy. Owing to the synergistic effect of phages with other
      antibacterial agents, they can be easily exploited for biomedical application.
      This review primarily focuses on the therapeutic implications of S. aureus phages
      in the biotechnological and medical arena. Through this review article, we have
      also discussed the current status and the incurring challenges in phage therapy.

TI  - Hesperidin inhibits biofilm formation, virulence and staphyloxanthin synthesis in
      methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus by targeting SarA and CrtM: an in
      vitro and in silico approach.
PG  - 44
LID - 10.1007/s11274-022-03232-5 [doi]
AB  - Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus is considered multidrug resistant
      bacterium due to developing biofilm formation associated with antimicrobial
      resistance mechanisms. Therefore, inhibition of biofilm formation is an
      alternative therapeutic action to control MRSA infections. The present study
      revealed the non-antibacterial biofilm inhibitory potential of hesperidin against
      ATCC strain and clinical isolates of S. aureus. Hesperidin is a flavanone
      glycoside commonly found in citrus fruit. Hesperidin has been shown to exhibits
      numerous pharmacological activities. The present study aimed to evaluate the
      antibiofilm and antivirulence potential of hesperidin against MRSA. Results
      showed that hesperidin treatment significantly impedes lipase, hemolysin,
      autolysin, autoaggregation and staphyloxanthin production. Reductions of
      staphyloxanthin production possibly increase the MRSA susceptibility rate to H2O2
      oxidative stress condition. In gene expression study revealed that hesperidin
      treatment downregulated the biofilm-associated gene (sarA), polysaccharide
      intracellular adhesion gene (icaA and icaD), autolysin (altA),
      fibronectin-binding protein (fnbA and fnbB) and staphyloxanthin production
      (crtM). Molecular docking analysis predicted the ability of hesperidin to
      interact with SarA and CrtM proteins involved in biofilm formation and
      staphyloxanthin production in MRSA.

      CeO2 (encoded BG-Zn, BG-Ti, BG-Te, and BG-Ce, respectively) were prepared using
      the melt-quench method and have been characterized before and after gamma
      irradiation at 25.0 kGy. X-ray diffraction was performed to recognize the
      amorphous phases of all samples. Infrared absorption of glasses confirms
      vibrational bands in their wave number according to mixed main triangular and
      tetrahedral borate groups. After immersion in the simulated body fluid (SBF)
      solution, two characteristic peaks are generated indicating the bioactivity of
      the studied glasses through the formation of hydroxyapatite. SEM micrographs of
      glass after immersion display that the crystalline phases are identified to be
      more distinct in different shapes because of the multi-composition involved. The 
      antibacterial activity of borate glasses was assessed against
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ATCC 6538. The antibacterial
      results showed that BG-Te was the most efficient against S. aureus ATCC 6538.
      Furthermore, BG-Te reduced biofilm production (79.23%) at the concentration of
      20.0 mg/mL. (BG-Te) at 20.0 mg/mL significantly decreased the viability percent, 
      cell count, protein content, and protease activity of S. aureus cells. BG-Te
      presents powerful activity against bacterial infections. It was necessary to
      equilibrate the antibacterial efficiency with the biocompatibility, so the MTT
      assay confirmed that BG-Te has low cytotoxicity on the human fibroblast cells
      (WI-38). It is expected that borate bioglass contained TeO2 could be a promising 
      biomaterial for bone tissue engineering.

TI  - A Guanosine-Quadruplex Hydrogel as Cascade Reaction Container Consuming
      Endogenous Glucose for Infected Wound Treatment-A Study in Diabetic Mice.
PG  - e2103485
LID - 10.1002/advs.202103485 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic foot ulcers infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria form a severe
      complication of diabetes. Antimicrobial-loaded hydrogels are used as a dressing
      for infected wounds, but the ongoing rise in the number of
      antimicrobial-resistant infections necessitates new, nonantibiotic based designs.
      Here, a guanosine-quadruplex (G4 )-hydrogel composed of guanosine,
      2-formylphenylboronic acid, and putrescine is designed and used as a
      cascade-reaction container. The G4 -hydrogel is loaded with glucose-oxidase and
      hemin. The first cascade-reaction, initiated by glucose-oxidase, transforms
      glucose and O2 into gluconic acid and H2 O2 . In vitro, this reaction is most
      influential on killing Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa in
      suspension, but showed limited killing of bacteria in biofilm-modes of growth.
      The second cascade-reaction, however, transforming H2 O2 into
      reactive-oxygen-species (ROS), also enhances killing of biofilm bacteria due to
      hemin penetration into biofilms and interaction with eDNA G-quadruplexes in the
      biofilm matrix. Therewith, the second cascade-reaction generates ROS close to the
      target bacteria, facilitating killing despite the short life-time of ROS. Healing
      of infected wounds in diabetic mice proceeds faster upon coverage by these G4
      -hydrogels than by clinically common ciprofloxacin irrigation. Moreover, local
      glucose concentrations around infected wounds decrease. Concluding, a G4
      -hydrogel loaded with glucose-oxidase and hemin is a good candidate for infected 
      wound dressings, particularly in diabetic patients.

TI  - New update on molecular diversity of clinical Staphylococcus aureus isolates in
      Iran: antimicrobial resistance, adhesion and virulence factors, biofilm formation
      and SCCmec typing.
LID - 10.1007/s11033-022-07140-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is often considered as a potential pathogen and
      resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. The pathogenicity of this bacterium is 
      due to the presence of multiple virulence factors and the ability to form
      biofilm. SCCmec types I, II and III are mainly attributed to HA-MRSA, while
      SCCmec types IV and V have usually been reported in CA-MRSA infections. METHODS
      AND RESULTS: In this study, we performed a cross-sectional study to determine the
      antimicrobial resistance, adhesion and virulence factors, biofilm formation and
      SCCmec typing of clinical S. aureus isolates in Iran. S. aureus isolates were
      identified using microbiological standard methods and antibiotic susceptibility
      tests were performed as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
      Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Inducible resistance phenotype and biofilm formation
      were determined using D-test and tissue culture plate methods, respectively.
      Multiplex-PCRs were performed to detect adhesion and virulence factors,
      antibiotic resistance genes, biofilm formation and SCCmec typing by specific
      primers. Among 143 clinical samples, 67.8% were identified as MRSA. All isolates 
      were susceptible to vancomycin. The prevalence of cMLSB, iMLSB and MS phenotypes 
      were 61.1%, 22.2% and 14.8%, respectively. The TCP method revealed that 71.3% of 
      isolates were able to form biofilm. The predominant virulence and inducible
      resistance genes in both MRSA and MSSA isolates were related to sea and ermC
      respectively. SCCmec type III was the predominant type. CONCLUSIONS: Data show
      the high prevalence rates of virulence elements among S. aureus isolates,
      especially MRSA strains. This result might be attributed to antibiotic pressure, 
      facilitating clonal selection.

LID - 10.1016/j.actbio.2022.01.033 [doi]
AB  - Chiral stereochemistry is a unique and fundamental strategy that determines the
      interaction of bacteria cells with chiral biomolecules and stereochemical
      surfaces. The interaction between bacteria and material surface (molecular
      chirality or supramolecular chirality) plays a significant role in modulating
      antibacterial performance. Herein, we developed inherent chiral antibacterial
      hydrogels by modifying the carboxyl groups of our previously reported
      supramolecular gelator (LPF-left handed phenylalanine gelator and DPF- right
      handed phenylalanine gelator) with 2-amino-5-methylthiazole (MTZ) and
      5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2- thiol (TDZ). The new L/D-gelator molecules initiate 
      self-assembly to form hydrogels through non-covalent interactions (Hydrogen
      bonding and pi-pi interactions) verified by FTIR and CD spectroscopy.
      Morphological studies of the xerogels revealed left and right-handed chiral
      nanofibers for the gelators' L-form and D-form, respectively. The resulting
      hydrogels exhibited inherent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive
      (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa) bacteria, with TDZ hydrogels showing more significant antibacterial
      activity than MTZ hydrogels. Interestingly, the D-form (having right-handed
      nanofibers) of both hydrogels (MTZ and TDZ) exhibited higher antibacterial
      activities compared with the left-handed nanofibrous hydrogels (L-form)
      attributed to the stereoselective interaction of the chiral helical nanofiber.
      Moreover, the amplification of chirality moving from a molecular to a
      supramolecular level essentially improved the antibacterial action. Our results
      provide deep insight into the development of unique supramolecular chiral
      antimicrobial agents and hint at the potentiality of right-handed nanofibers
      (D-form) having enhanced antibacterial activity. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE:
      Chiral stereochemistry plays a significant role in many biological processes,
      which determines the interaction of bacteria cells with chiral biomolecules. The 
      interaction between bacteria and material surface (molecular chirality or
      supramolecular chirality) plays a significant role in modulating antibacterial
      performance. Here, we deigned and synthesized unique inherent biocompatible
      supramolecular chiral hydrogel. From this study we concluded that the D-form
      (having right-handed nanofibers) of hydrogels exhibited higher antibacterial
      activities compared with the left-handed nanofibrous hydrogels (L-form)
      attributed to the stereoselective interaction of the chiral helical nanofiber.
      Additionally, this study also explored the amplification of chirality moving from
      a molecular to a supramolecular level essentially improved the antibacterial
      action.

AB  - Diclofenac is an anti-inflammatory drug and has been frequently detected from the
      wastewater. In the present study, factors affecting diclofenac adsorption on
      sewage sludge was evaluated. At 1 mg/L initial diclofenac concentration, more
      than 80% diclofenac removal was achieved. Adsorption increased at higher
      concentration (100 mg/L concentration) and more than 99% diclofenac was adsorbed 
      from the wastewater. Significant removal of diclofenac was observed after 5 min
      contact time. The adsorption efficacy was more than 98% after 50 and 60 min.
      Pseudo-first and second order kinetics revealed reasonable regression value (0.9)
      indicated that the model is best fitted. Diclofenac adsorption was extremely high
      at acidic pHs than alkaline range. The sludge samples showed the presence of
      multi drug resistant bacteria. Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus stains were 27%,
      Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive strains were 16.5% and
      Extended-spectrum betal-lactamase-harbouring Enterobacteriacea were 65.4% in the 
      sludge. The drug resistance Enterobacteriaceae revealed 14 Klebsiella pneumonia
      strains, 11 strains from E. coli and two from the genus Enterobacter. To
      conclude, the activated sludge could be effectively utilized for the removal of
      diclofenac from wastewater.

AB  - Zerovalent Iron Nanoparticles (MC-ZVI NPs) were synthesized from Musa coocinea
      peel extract as reducing and stabilizing agent using a novel synthesis technique.
      The synthesis of MC-ZVI NPs was confirmed using UV-vis spectroscopy showing a
      sharp absorption peak at 341 nm. Further the chemical and structural
      characterization of MC-ZVI NPs were performed using Fourier Transform Infrared
      spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Dynamic Light
      Scattering technique (DLS). FTIR analysis revealed the presence of phytochemical 
      molecules associated with the MC-ZVI NPs. SEM analysis revealed the synthesized
      MC-ZVI NPs were in spherical shaped, while DLS analysis confirmed the synthesis
      of poly dispersed and non-homogenous MC-ZVI NPs. The antimicrobial efficacy of
      MC-ZVI NPs synthesized using Musa coccinea peel extract was tested against
      bacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and
      Bacillus subtilis) and fungal (Aspergillus niger) pathogens. But MC-ZVI NPs
      exhibited maximum of 19 mm zone of inhibition against B. subtilis and A. niger.
      Further the free radical scavenging activity MC-ZVI NPs was confirmed using DPPH,
      hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, FRAP assay showing displayed effective
      antioxidant activity. Thus, the present idea will give a fast and cost effective 
      approach to synthesize MC-ZVI NPs with antimicrobial property for application in 
      biomedical purposes.

TI  - Biapenem.
PG  - 11-12
AB  - Biapenem is a novel parenteral broad spectrum carbapenem primarily used for the
      treatment of complicated infections like sepsis, lower respiratory infections,
      urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal and genitourinary infections etc. in
      Japan, Thailand and China since two decades, has been recently approved in India.
      Biapenem shows good bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria
      including streptococcus pneumoniae, pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible
      staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). It also shows antibacterial activities against
      Gram-negative bacteria including resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
      Acinetobacter baumannii. Evidence from international studies confirmed that
      biapenem can be used as effectively and safely as meropenem or imipenem/
      cilastatin in the treatment of various infectious diseases. This article
      summarizes the milestones, unique structure, mechanism of action,
      pharmacokinetics, special pharmacological properties and spectrum of in vitro
      activity of biapenem. The results of comparative clinical trials on Biapenem are 
      also described, as is the patient safety and tolerability observed during these
      studies.

TI  - Bacterial Toxins from Staphylococcus aureus and Bordetella bronchiseptica
      Predispose the Horse's Respiratory Tract to Equine Herpesvirus Type 1 Infection.
LID - 149 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14010149 [doi]
AB  - Respiratory disease in horses is caused by a multifactorial complex of infectious
      agents and environmental factors. An important pathogen in horses is equine
      herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1). During co-evolution with this ancient
      alphaherpesvirus, the horse's respiratory tract has developed multiple antiviral 
      barriers. However, these barriers can become compromised by environmental
      threats. Pollens and mycotoxins enhance mucosal susceptibility to EHV-1 by
      interrupting cell junctions, allowing the virus to reach its basolateral
      receptor. Whether bacterial toxins also play a role in this impairment has not
      been studied yet. Here, we evaluated the role of alpha-hemolysin (Hla) and
      adenylate cyclase (ACT), toxins derived from the facultative pathogenic bacterium
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and the primary pathogen Bordetella
      bronchiseptica (B. bronchiseptica), respectively. Equine respiratory mucosal
      explants were cultured at an air-liquid interface and pretreated with these
      toxins, prior to EHV-1 inoculation. Morphological analysis of hematoxylin-eosin
      (HE)-stained sections of the explants revealed a decreased epithelial thickness
      upon treatment with both toxins. Additionally, the Hla toxin induced detachment
      of epithelial cells and a partial loss of cilia. These morphological changes were
      correlated with increased EHV-1 replication in the epithelium, as assessed by
      immunofluorescent stainings and confocal microscopy. In view of these results, we
      argue that the ACT and Hla toxins increase the susceptibility of the epithelium
      to EHV-1 by disrupting the epithelial barrier function. In conclusion, this study
      is the first to report that bacterial exotoxins increase the horse's sensitivity 
      to EHV-1 infection. Therefore, we propose that horses suffering from infection by
      S. aureus or B. bronchiseptica may be more susceptible to EHV-1 infection.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of Streptomyces bacteriophages and Streptomyces
      strains encoding biosynthetic arsenals.
PG  - e0262354
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0262354 [doi]
AB  - The threat to public health posed by drug-resistant bacteria is rapidly
      increasing, as some of healthcare's most potent antibiotics are becoming
      obsolete. Approximately two-thirds of the world's antibiotics are derived from
      natural products produced by Streptomyces encoded biosynthetic gene clusters.
      Thus, to identify novel gene clusters, we sequenced the genomes of four bioactive
      Streptomyces strains isolated from the soil in San Diego County and used
      Bacterial Cytological Profiling adapted for agar plate culturing in order to
      examine the mechanisms of bacterial inhibition exhibited by these strains. In the
      four strains, we identified 104 biosynthetic gene clusters. Some of these
      clusters were predicted to produce previously studied antibiotics; however, the
      known mechanisms of these molecules could not fully account for the antibacterial
      activity exhibited by the strains, suggesting that novel clusters might encode
      antibiotics. When assessed for their ability to inhibit the growth of clinically 
      isolated pathogens, three Streptomyces strains demonstrated activity against
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, due to the utility of 
      bacteriophages for genetically manipulating bacterial strains via transduction,
      we also isolated four new phages (BartholomewSD, IceWarrior, Shawty, and
      TrvxScott) against S. platensis. A genomic analysis of our phages revealed nearly
      200 uncharacterized proteins, including a new site-specific serine integrase that
      could prove to be a useful genetic tool. Sequence analysis of the Streptomyces
      strains identified CRISPR-Cas systems and specific spacer sequences that allowed 
      us to predict phage host ranges. Ultimately, this study identified Streptomyces
      strains with the potential to produce novel chemical matter as well as
      integrase-encoding phages that could potentially be used to manipulate these
      strains.

TI  - Membrane damage as mechanism of photodynamic inactivation using Methylene blue
      and TMPyP in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
LID - 10.1007/s43630-021-00158-z [doi]
AB  - The worldwide threat of antibiotic resistance requires alternative strategies to 
      fight bacterial infections. A promising approach to support conventional
      antibiotic therapy is the antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDI). The aim
      of this work was to show further insights into the antimicrobial photodynamic
      principle using two photosensitizers (PS) of different chemical classes,
      Methylene Blue (MB) and TMPyP, and the organisms Escherichia coli and
      Staphylococcus aureus as Gram-negative and Gram-positive representatives.
      Planktonic cultures of both species were cultured under aerobic conditions for 24
      h followed by treatment with MB or TMPyP at various concentrations for an
      incubation period of 10 min and subsequent irradiation for 10 min. Ability to
      replicate was evaluated by CFU assay. Accumulation of PS was measured using a
      spectrophotometer. The cytoplasmic membrane integrity was investigated by flow
      cytometry using SYBR Green and propidium iodide. In experiments on the
      replication ability of bacteria after photodynamic treatment with TMPyP or MB, a 
      killing rate of 5 log10 steps of the bacteria was achieved.
      Concentration-dependent accumulation of both PS was shown by spectrophotometric
      measurements whereby a higher accumulation of TMPyP and less accumulation of MB
      was found for S. aureus as compared to E. coli. For the first time, a
      membrane-damaging effect of TMPyP and MB in both bacterial strains could be shown
      using flow cytometry analyses. Furthermore, we found that reduction of the
      replication ability occurs with lower concentrations than needed for membrane
      damage upon MB suggesting that membrane damage is not the only mechanism of aPDI 
      using MB.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the genomic epidemiology of MRSA in
      China to identify predominant lineages and their associated genomic and
      phenotypic characteristics. In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing
      on 565 MRSA isolates from 7 provinces and municipalities of China between 2014
      and 2020. MRSA isolates were subjected to MLST, spa typing, SCCmec typing,
      analysis of virulence determinants and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
      Among 565 MRSA isolates tested, clonal complex (CC) 59 (31.2%), CC5 (23.4%) and
      CC8 (13.63%) were the major lineages, and the clonal structure was dominated by
      ST59-t437-IV (14.9%), ST239-t030-III (6.4%) and ST5-t2460-II (6.0%),
      respectively. Of note, CC8, the predominant lineage in 2014-2015, was replaced by
      CC59 after 2016. Interestingly, the extension and unstable structure of the CC5
      population was observed, with ST5-t311-II, ST764-t1084-II, ST5-t2460-II and
      ST764-t002-II existing complex competition. Further analysis revealed that
      virulence determinant profiles and antibiograms were closely associated with the 
      clonal lineage. The CC59 MRSA was less resistant to most tested antimicrobials
      and carried fewer resistance determinants. But rifampicin resistance and
      mupirocin resistance were closely linked with CC8 and CC5, respectively. MRSA
      isolates conservatively carried multiple virulence genes involved in various
      functions. PVL encoding genes were more common in ST338, CC30, CC398, ST8 and
      CC22, while tsst-1 was associated with ST5. In conclusion, the
      community-associated CC59-ST59-t437-IV lineage was predominant in China, with
      diverse clonal isolates alternately circulating in various geographical
      locations. Our study highlights the need for MRSA surveillance in China to
      monitor changes in MRSA epidemiology.

LID - 10.1002/1873-3468.14292 [doi]
AB  - Superantigens (SAgs) are bacterial enterotoxins produced by Staphylococcus
      aureus. Staphylococcal enterotoxin type A (SEA), a staphylococcal superantigen,
      has been shown to bind to the cytokine signalling receptor glycoprotein 130
      (gp130). The structural details, as well as the exact physiological role of this 
      interaction, remain unclear. Here, we describe the structural details of the
      SEA-gp130 complex by combining crosslinking mass spectrometry and computational
      modelling. Interestingly, SEA is not able to bind gp130-homologues from rat and
      mouse. Our data suggest that SEA may interact with human gp130 in a different
      manner than other known gp130-ligands. Moreover, the fact that SEA does not bind 
      mouse or rat gp130 suggests that SAgs have additional mechanisms of action in
      humans.

PG  - 100099
LID - 10.1016/j.crmicr.2021.100099 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria are emerging and spreading globally,
      threatening our ability to treat common infectious diseases. The development of
      new classes of antibiotics able to kill or inhibit the growth of such AMR
      bacteria through novel mechanisms of action is therefore urgently needed. Here, a
      new family of indole-containing arene ruthenium organometallic compounds are
      screened against several bacterial species and drug resistant strains. The most
      active complex [(p-cym)Ru(O-cyclohexyl-1H-indole-2-carbothioate)Cl] (3) shows
      growth inhibition and bactericidal activity against different organisms
      (Acinetobacter baumannii, Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
      Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Escherichia coli),
      demonstrating broad-spectrum inhibitory activity. Importantly, this compound
      series exhibits low toxicity against human cells. Owing to the novelty of the
      antibiotic family, their moderate cytotoxicity, and their inhibitory activity
      against Gram positive, Gram negative and acid-fast, antibiotic resistant
      microorganisms, this series shows significant promise for further development.

TI  - Abnormal Somatosensory Behaviors Associated With a Gain-of-Function Mutation in
      TRPV3 Channels.
PG  - 790435
LID - 10.3389/fnmol.2021.790435 [doi]
AB  - Thermosensitive transient receptor potential V3 (TRPV3) is a polymodal receptor
      implicated in nociceptive, thermoceptive, pruritoceptive, and inflammatory
      pathways. Reports focused on understanding the role of TRPV3 in thermoception or 
      nociception are not conclusive. Previous studies also show that aberrant
      hyperactivity of TRPV3 channels results in spontaneous itch and dermatitis-like
      symptoms, but the resultant behavior is highly dependent on the background of the
      animal and the skin microbiome. To determine the function of hyperactive TRPV3
      channels in somatosensory sensations, we tested different somatosensory behaviors
      using a genetic mouse model that carries a gain-of-function point mutation G573S 
      in the Trpv3 gene (Trpv3 (G573S) ). Here we report that Trpv3 (G573S) mutants
      show reduced perception of cold, acetone-induced cooling, punctate, and sharp
      mechanical pain. By contrast, locomotion, noxious heat, touch, and mechanical
      itch are unaffected in Trpv3 (G573S) mice. We fail to observe any spontaneous
      itch responses and/or dermatitis in Trpv3 (G573S) mutants under specific pathogen
      (Staphylococcus aureus)-free conditions. However, we find that the scratching
      events in response to various pruritogens are dramatically decreased in Trpv3
      (G573S) mice in comparison to wild-type littermates. Interestingly, we observe
      sensory hypoinnervation of the epidermis in Trpv3 (G573S) mutants, which might

AB  - Background: Mangroves contain several bioactive compounds, some of which have
      been used for centuries as remedies for several ailments. Methods: Foliar parts
      of Excoecaria agallocha were extracted in organic solvents and in water using a
      Soxhlet apparatus and evaluated for antimicrobial activity against nine
      type-culture pathogens, six clinical isolates, and two fungal pathogens with agar
      well diffusion assays. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum
      bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined by broth dilution and extracts
      further subjected to brine-shrimp cytotoxic assays using Artemia salina. Chemical
      constituents were analyzed with thin-layer chromatography (TLC), gas
      chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), and Fourier-transform infrared
      spectroscopy (FT-IR). Results and Discussion: Ethyl acetate extract displayed the
      broadest antimicrobial activity. Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were found to 
      be the most susceptible among the clinical and type-culture groups corresponding 
      to inhibition zones: 17.3+/-1.1 and 23.5+/-1.3 mm in diameter, respectively.
      Anticandidal activity was found to be lower against Candida albicans and C.
      tropicalis (10.3+/-0.6 and 11.9+/-0.85 mm diameter). Also, this extract was found
      to be bactericidal for S. aureus and Micrococcus luteus (MBC:MIC </=2). C
      cytotoxic activity LD50 was 521 microg/mL. On GC-MS, squalene [(6E, 10E, 4E,
      18E)-2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosa-2,6,10,14,18,22-hexaene] was the major
      compound. Bioassay-guided (antibacterial) TLC revealed the presence of one major 
      active fraction, F2, with an Rf value of 1.21. FT-IR analysis of this fraction
      also implied that it was squalene, which might have a functional role in the
      mechanism of chemical defense.

PG  - 146-154
LID - 10.1038/s41429-022-00500-2 [doi]
AB  - Disulfide analogs of the alcohol sobriety medication disulfiram (Antabuse(R))
      were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. Structure-activity relationship
      analyses of MIC data obtained for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA) and other pathogenic organisms revealed correlations between the
      lipophilicity and bulkiness of the substituents. Analogs conferring optimal
      anti-MRSA activity contained S-octyl disulfides and either N,N-dimethyl- or
      N-pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate substituents. Additional testing revealed that both
      disulfiram and its S-octyl derivative are capable of sensitizing S. aureus to the
      bactericidal effects of fosfomycin. Mechanistic studies established that the
      compounds decrease intracellular levels of the fosB cofactor bacillithiol through
      a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. The increased fosfomycin susceptibility in
      S. aureus was thereby attributed to a depleted cellular bacillithiol pool
      available for inactivation by fosB.

TI  - Engineered human antibodies for the opsonization and killing of Staphylococcus
      aureus.

AB  - Gram-positive organisms with their thick envelope cannot be lysed by complement
      alone. Nonetheless, antibody-binding on the surface can recruit complement and
      mark these invaders for uptake and killing by phagocytes, a process known as
      opsonophagocytosis. The crystallizable fragment of immunoglobulins (Fcgamma) is
      key for complement recruitment. The cell surface of S. aureus is coated with
      Staphylococcal protein A (SpA). SpA captures the Fcgamma domain of IgG and
      interferes with opsonization by anti-S. aureus antibodies. In principle, the
      Fcgamma domain of therapeutic antibodies could be engineered to avoid the
      inhibitory activity of SpA. However, the SpA-binding site on Fcgamma overlaps
      with that of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), an interaction that is critical for
      prolonging the half-life of serum IgG. This evolutionary adaptation poses a
      challenge for the exploration of Fcgamma mutants that can both weaken SpA-IgG
      interactions and retain stability. Here, we use both wild-type and transgenic
      human FcRn mice to identify antibodies with enhanced half-life and increased
      opsonophagocytic killing in models of S. aureus infection and demonstrate that
      antibody-based immunotherapy can be improved by modifying Fcgamma. Our
      experiments also show that by competing for FcRn-binding, staphylococci
      effectively reduce the half-life of antibodies during infection. These
      observations may have profound impact in treating cancer, autoimmune, and asthma 
      patients colonized or infected with S. aureus and undergoing monoclonal antibody 
      treatment.

TI  - PLGA/PEG Nanoparticles Loaded with Cyclodextrin-Peganum harmala Alkaloid Complex 
      and Ascorbic Acid with Promising Antimicrobial Activities.
LID - 142 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14010142 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial drugs face numerous challenges, including drug resistance, systemic
      toxic effects, and poor bioavailability. To date, treatment choices are limited, 
      which warrants the search for novel potent antivirals, including those extracted 
      from natural products. The seeds of Peganum harmala L. (Zygophyllaceae family)
      have been reported to have antimicrobial, antifungal, and anticancer activities. 
      In the present study, a 2-hydroxy propyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD)/harmala
      alkaloid-rich fraction (HARF) host-guest complex was prepared using a thin-film
      hydration method to improve the water solubility and bioavailability of HARF. The
      designed complex was then co-encapsulated with ascorbic acid into PLGA
      nanoparticles coated with polyethylene glycol (HARF-HPssCD/AA@PLGA-PEG NPs) using
      the W/O/W multiple emulsion-solvent evaporation method. The average particle
      size, PDI, and zeta potential were 207.90 +/- 2.60 nm, 0.17 +/- 0.01, and 31.6
      +/- 0.20 mV, respectively. The entrapment efficiency for HARF was 81.60 +/- 1.20%
      and for ascorbic acid was 88 +/- 2.20%. HARF-HPssCD/AA@PLGA-PEG NPs had the
      highest antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli
      (MIC of 0.025 mg/mL). They also exhibited high selective antiviral activity
      against the H1N1 influenza virus (IC50 2.7 mug/mL) without affecting the host
      (MDCK cells). In conclusion, the co-encapsulation of HPCD-HARF complex and
      ascorbic acid into PLGA-PEG nanoparticles significantly increased the selective
      H1N1 killing activity with minimum host toxic effects.

TI  - Tailoring of Novel Azithromycin-Loaded Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles for Wound
      Healing.
LID - 111 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14010111 [doi]
AB  - Skin is the largest mechanical barrier against invading pathogens. Following skin
      injury, the healing process immediately starts to regenerate the damaged tissues 
      and to avoid complications that usually include colonization by pathogenic
      bacteria, leading to fever and sepsis, which further impairs and complicates the 
      healing process. So, there is an urgent need to develop a novel pharmaceutical
      material that promotes the healing of infected wounds. The present work aimed to 
      prepare and evaluate the efficacy of novel azithromycin-loaded zinc oxide
      nanoparticles (AZM-ZnONPs) in the treatment of infected wounds. The Box-Behnken
      design and response surface methodology were used to evaluate loading efficiency 
      and release characteristics of the prepared NPs. The minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) of the formulations was determined against Staphylococcus
      aureus and Escherichia coli. Moreover, the anti-bacterial and wound-healing
      activities of the AZM-loaded ZnONPs impregnated into hydroxyl propyl
      methylcellulose (HPMC) gel were evaluated in an excisional wound model in rats.
      The prepared ZnONPs were loaded with AZM by adsorption. The prepared ZnONPs were 
      fully characterized by XRD, EDAX, SEM, TEM, and FT-IR analysis. Particle size
      distribution for the prepared ZnO and AZM-ZnONPs were determined and found to be 
      34 and 39 nm, respectively. The mechanism by which AZM adsorbed on the surface of
      ZnONPs was the best fit by the Freundlich model with a maximum load capacity of
      160.4 mg/g. Anti-microbial studies showed that AZM-ZnONPs were more effective
      than other controls. Using an experimental infection model in rats, AZM-ZnONPs
      impregnated into HPMC gel enhanced bacterial clearance and epidermal
      regeneration, and stimulated tissue formation. In conclusion, AZM -loaded ZnONPs 
      are a promising platform for effective and rapid healing of infected wounds.

TI  - "Smart" Polylactic Acid Films with Ceftriaxone Loaded Microchamber Arrays for
      Personalized Antibiotic Therapy.
LID - 42 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14010042 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial infections are a severe medical problem, especially in traumatology,
      orthopedics, and surgery. The local use of antibiotics-elution materials has made
      it possible to increase the effectiveness of acute infections treatment. However,
      the infection prevention problem remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate the
      fabrication of polylactic acid (PLA) "smart" films with microchamber arrays.
      These microchambers contain ceftriaxone as a payload in concentrations ranging
      from 12 +/- 1 mug/cm(2) to 38 +/- 8 mug/cm(2), depending on the patterned film
      thickness formed by the different PLA concentrations in chloroform. In addition, 
      the release profile of the antibiotic can be prolonged up to 72 h in saline. At
      the same time, on the surface of agar plates, the antibiotic release time
      increases up to 96 h, which has been confirmed by the growth suppression of the
      Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The efficient loading and optimal release rate
      are obtained for patterned films formed by the 1.5 wt % PLA in chloroform. The
      films produced from 1.5 and 2 wt % PLA solutions (thickness-0.42 +/- 0.12 and
      0.68 +/- 0.16 microm, respectively) show an accelerated ceftriaxone release upon 
      the trigger of the therapeutic ultrasound, which impacted as an expansion of the 
      bacterial growth inhibition zone around the samples. Combining prolonged drug
      elution with the on-demand release ability of large cargo amount opens up new
      approaches for personalized and custom-tunable antibacterial therapy.

TI  - Bacteriomimetic Liposomes Improve Antibiotic Activity of a Novel Energy-Coupling 
      Factor Transporter Inhibitor.
LID - 4 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14010004 [doi]
AB  - Liposomes have been studied for decades as nanoparticulate drug delivery systems 
      for cytostatics, and more recently, for antibiotics. Such nanoantibiotics show
      improved antibacterial efficacy compared to the free drug and can be effective
      despite bacterial recalcitrance. In this work, we present a loading method of
      bacteriomimetic liposomes for a novel, hydrophobic compound (HIPS5031) inhibiting
      energy-coupling factor transporters (ECF transporters), an underexplored
      antimicrobial target. The liposomes were composed of DOPG (18:1 (Delta9-cis)
      phosphatidylglycerol) and CL (cardiolipin), resembling the cell membrane of
      Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enriched
      with cholesterol (Chol). The size and polydispersity of the DOPG/CL/+/- Chol
      liposomes remained stable over 8 weeks when stored at 4 degrees C. Loading of the
      ECF transporter inhibitor was achieved by thin film hydration and led to a high
      encapsulation efficiency of 33.19% +/- 9.5% into the DOPG/CL/Chol liposomes
      compared to the phosphatidylcholine liposomes (DMPC/DPPC). Bacterial growth
      inhibition assays on the model organism Bacillus subtilis revealed liposomal
      HIPS5031 as superior to the free drug, showing a 3.5-fold reduction in CFU/mL at 
      a concentration of 9.64 microM. Liposomal HIPS5031 was also shown to reduce B.
      subtilis biofilm. Our findings present an explorative basis for bacteriomimetic
      liposomes as a strategy against drug-resistant pathogens by surpassing the
      drug-formulation barriers of innovative, yet unfavorably hydrophobic,
      antibiotics.

      Applications.
LID - 579 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27020579 [doi]
AB  - This work describes an environmental-friendly preparation of ZnO nanoparticles
      using aqueous oat extract. The advanced electrochemical and optical features of
      green synthesized ZnONPs displayed excellent antibacterial activity and exhibited
      an important role in pharmaceutical determinations. The formation of nanoscale
      ZnO was confirmed using various spectroscopic and microscopic investigations. The
      formed nanoparticles were found to be around 100 nm. The as-prepared ZnONPs were 
      monitored for their antibacterial potential against different bacterial strains. 
      The inhibition zones for ZnONPs were found as Escherichia coli (16 mm),
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 mm), Staphylococcus aureus (12 mm) and Bacillus
      subtilis (11 mm) using a 30-microg mL(-1) sample concentration. In addition,
      ZnONPs exhibited significant antioxidant effects, from 58 to 67%, with an average
      IC50 value of 0.88 +/- 0.03 scavenging activity and from 53 to 71% (IC50 value of
      0.73 +/- 0.05) versus the scavenging free radicals DPPH and ABTS, respectively.
      The photocatalytic potential of ZnONPs for Rhodamine B dye degradation under UV
      irradiation was calculated. The photodegradation process was carried out as a
      function of time-dependent and complete degradation (nearly 98%), with color
      removal after 120 min. Conclusively, the synthesized ZnONPs using oat biomass
      might provide a great promise in the future for biomedical applications.

      Staphylococcus aureus.
LID - 574 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27020574 [doi]
AB  - Propolis is a natural bee product that is widely used in folk medicine. This
      study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of ethanolic
      extract of propolis (EEP) on methicillin-resistant and sensitive Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA and MSSA). Propolis samples were collected from six regions in
      Hungary. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values and the interaction
      of EEP-antibiotics were evaluated by the broth microdilution and the chequerboard
      broth microdilution methods, respectively. The effect of EEP on biofilm formation
      and eradication was estimated by crystal violet assay. Resazurin/propidium iodide
      dyes were applied for simultaneous quantification of cellular metabolic
      activities and dead cells in mature biofilms. The EEP1 sample showed the highest 
      phenolic and flavonoid contents. The EEP1 successfully prevented the growth of
      planktonic cells of S. aureus (MIC value = 50 microg/mL). Synergistic
      interactions were shown after the co-exposition to EEP1 and vancomycin at 10(8)
      CFU/mL. The EEP1 effectively inhibited the biofilm formation and caused
      significant degradation of mature biofilms (50-200 microg/mL), as a consequence
      of the considerable decrement of metabolic activity. The EEP acts effectively as 
      an antimicrobial and antibiofilm agent on S. aureus. Moreover, the simultaneous
      application of EEP and vancomycin could enhance their effect against MRSA
      infection.

TI  - Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Potential of Scenedesmus obliquus Microalgae in the
      Context of Integral Biorefinery Concept.
LID - 519 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27020519 [doi]
AB  - Small-scale photobioreactors (PBRs) in the inoculum stage were designed with
      internal (red or green) and external white LED light as an initial step of a
      larger-scale installation aimed at fulfilling the integral biorefinery concept
      for maximum utilization of microalgal biomass in a multifunctional laboratory.
      The specific growth rate of Scenedesmus obliquus (Turpin) Kutzing biomass for
      given cultural conditions was analyzed by using MAPLE software. For the
      determination of total polyphenols, flavonoids, chlorophyll "a" and "b",
      carotenoids and lipids, UHPLC-HRMS, ISO-20776/1, ISO-10993-5 and CUPRAC tests
      were carried out. Under red light growing, a higher content of polyphenols was
      found, while the green light favoured the flavonoid accumulation in the biomass. 
      Chlorophylls, carotenoids and lipids were in the same order of magnitude in both 
      samples. The dichloromethane extracts obtained from the biomass of each PBR
      synergistically potentiated at low concentrations (0.01-0.05 mg/mL) the
      antibacterial activity of penicillin, fluoroquinolones or oregano essential oil
      against the selected food-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia
      coli and Salmonella typhimurium) without showing any in vitro cytotoxicity. Both 
      extracts exhibited good cupric ion-reducing antioxidant capacity at
      concentrations above 0.042-0.08 mg/mL. The UHPLC-HRMS analysis revealed that both
      extracts contained long chain fatty acids and carotenoids thus explaining their
      antibacterial and antioxidant potential. The applied engineering approach showed 
      a great potential to modify microalgae metabolism for the synthesis of target
      compounds by S. obliquus with capacity for the development of health-promoting
      nutraceuticals for poultry farming.

AB  - In the present study, Zingiber officinale is used for the synthesis of Zingiber
      officinale capped silver nanoparticles (ZOE-AgNPs) and compares the antimicrobial
      efficacy and compressive strength of conventional glass ionomer cement (GIC)
      combined with ZOE-AgNPs, lyophilized miswak, and chlorhexidine diacetate (CHX)
      against oral microbes. Five groups of the disc-shaped GIC specimens were
      prepared. Group A: lyophilized miswak and GIC combination, Group B: ZOE-AgNPs and
      GIC combinations, Group C: CHX and GIC combination, Group D: ZOE-AgNPs + CHX +
      GIC; Group E: Conventional GIC. Results confirmed the successful formation of
      ZOE-AgNPs that was monitored by UV-Vis sharp absorption spectra at 415 nm. The
      X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) results
      revealed the formation of ZOE-AgNPs with a mean size 10.5-14.12 nm. The peaks of 
      the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were appearing the involvement
      of ZOE components onto the surface of ZOE-AgNPs which played as bioreducing, and 
      stabilizing agents. At a 24-h, one-week and three-week intervals, Group D showed 
      the significantly highest mean inhibitory zones compared to Group A, Group B, and
      Group C. At microbe-level comparison, Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus
      aureus were inhibited significantly by all the specimens tested except group E
      when compared to Candida albicans. Group D specimens showed slightly higher (45.8
      +/- 5.4) mean compressive strength in comparison with other groups. The
      combination of GIC with ZOE-AgNPs and chlorhexidine together enhanced its
      antimicrobial efficacy and compressive strength compared to GIC with ZOE-AgNPs or
      lyophilized miswak or chlorhexidine combination alone. The present study revealed
      that The combination of GIC with active components of ZOE-AgNPs and chlorhexidine
      paves the way to lead its effective nano-dental materials applications.

LID - 487 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27020487 [doi]
AB  - Fungal laccase obtained from a Cerrena unicolor strain was used as an effective
      biocatalyst for the transformation of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid into a
      green-coloured antibacterial compound, which can be considered as both an
      antimicrobial agent and a textile dye, simultaneously. The process of
      biosynthesis was performed in buffered solutions containing methanol as a
      co-solvent, allowing better solubilisation of substrate. The transformation
      process was optimised in terms of the buffer pH value, laccase activity, and
      concentrations of the substrate and co-solvent. The crude product obtained
      exhibited low cytotoxicity, antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus
      aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and antioxidant properties. Moreover, the 
      synthesised green-coloured compound proved non-allergenic and demonstrated a high
      efficiency of dyeing wool fibres.

TI  - Chemical Profile of Lipophilic Fractions of Different Parts of Zizyphus lotus L. 
      by GC-MS and Evaluation of Their Antiproliferative and Antibacterial Activities.
LID - 483 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27020483 [doi]
AB  - Zizyphus lotus L. is a perennial shrub particularly used in Algerian folk
      medicine, but little is known concerning the lipophilic compounds in the most
      frequently used parts, namely, root bark, pulp, leaves and seeds, which are
      associated with health benefits. In this vein, the lipophilic fractions of these 
      morphological parts of Z. lotus from Morocco were studied by gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and their antiproliferative and
      antimicrobial activities were evaluated. GC-MS analysis allowed the
      identification and quantification of 99 lipophilic compounds, including fatty
      acids, long-chain aliphatic alcohols, pentacyclic triterpenic compounds, sterols,
      monoglycerides, aromatic compounds and other minor components. Lipophilic
      extracts of pulp, leaves and seeds were revealed to be mainly composed of fatty
      acids, representing 54.3-88.6% of the total compounds detected. The leaves and
      seeds were particularly rich in unsaturated fatty acids, namely,
      (9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic acid (2431 mg kg(-1) of dry weight) and
      (9Z)-octadec-9-enoic acid (6255 mg kg(-1) of dry weight). In contrast, root bark 
      contained a high content of pentacyclic triterpenic compounds, particularly
      betulinic acid, accounting for 9838 mg kg(-1) of dry weight. Root bark extract
      showed promising antiproliferative activity against a triple-negative breast
      cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
      = 4.23 +/- 0.18 microg mL(-1) of extract. Leaf extract displayed interesting
      antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, methicillin-sensitive
      Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis, presenting minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) values from 1024 to 2048 microg mL(-1) of extract. Our
      results demonstrate that Zizyphus lotus L. is a source of promising bioactive
      components, which can be exploited as natural ingredients in pharmaceutical
      formulations.

      Alternative for Antibiotic Resistance in Human.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27020468 [doi]
AB  - To meet the demand for alternatives to commonly used antibiotics, this paper
      evaluates the antimicrobial potential of arene-ruthenium(II) complexes and their 
      salts, which may be of value in antibacterial treatment. Their antimicrobial
      activity (MIC, MBC/MFC) was examined in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus,
      Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      Proteus vulgaris and Candida albicans and compared with classic antibiotics used 
      as therapeutics. Selected arene-ruthenium(II) complexes were found to have
      synergistic effects with oxacillin and vancomycin against staphylococci. Their
      bactericidal effect was found to be associated with cell lysis and the ability to
      cut microbial DNA. To confirm the safety of the tested arene-ruthenium(II)
      complexes in vivo, their cytotoxicity was also investigated against normal human 
      foreskin fibroblasts (HFF-1). In addition, the antioxidant and thus pro-health
      potential of the compounds, i.e., their nonenzymatic antioxidant capacity (NEAC),
      was determined by two different methods: ferric-TPTZ complex and DPPH assay.

TI  - The Untargeted Phytochemical Profile of Three Meliaceae Species Related to In
      Vitro Cytotoxicity and Anti-Virulence Activity against MRSA Isolates.
LID - 435 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27020435 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A high mortality rate is associated with about 80% of all infections 
      worldwide, mainly due to antimicrobial resistance. Various antimicrobial and
      cytotoxic activities have been proposed for Meliaceae species. This study aimed
      to evaluate the in vitro anti-virulence and cytotoxic effect of the leaf extracts
      of Aphanamixis polystachya, Toona ciliata and Melia azedarach against five MRSA
      strains and on three cancer cell lines, followed by biological correlation to
      their encompassed phytoconstituents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We explored three
      plants of this family against a panel of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA) strains and several cancer cell lines to select the most promising 
      candidates for further in vivo and preclinical studies. The phytochemical
      composition was evaluated by UHPLC-QTOF-MS untargeted profiling. Cell viability
      was assessed by SRB assay. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration was carried out by
      using the agar micro-dilution technique. Inhibition of biofilm formation and
      preformed biofilm disruption were assessed spectrophotomertically, according to
      the Sultan and Nabil method (2019). RESULTS: A total of 279 compounds were
      putatively annotated to include different phytochemical classes, such as
      flavonoids (108), limonoids/terpenoids (59), phenolic acids (49) and
      lower-molecular-weight phenolics (39). A. polystachya extract showed the most
      potent cytotoxic activity against Huh-7, DU-145 and MCF-7 cell lines (IC50 = 3,
      3.5 and 13.4 microg mL(-1), respectively), followed by M. azedarach, with no
      effect recorded for T. ciliata extract. Furthermore, both A. polystachya and M.
      azedarach extracts showed promising anti-virulence and antimicrobial activities, 
      with A. polystachya being particularly active against MRSA. These two latter
      extracts could inhibit and disrupt the biofilm, formed by MRSA, at sub-lethal
      concentrations. Interestingly, the extracts inhibited hemolysin-alpha enzyme,
      thus protecting rabbit RBCs from lysis. A. polystachya extract reduced the
      pigmentation and catalase enzyme activity of tested pigmented strains better than
      M. azedarach at both tested sub-MICs. Consequently, susceptibility of the
      extract-treated cells to oxidant killing by 200 mM H2O2 increased, leading to
      faster killing of the cells within 120 min as compared to the extract-non-treated
      cells, likely due to the lower antioxidant-scavenging activity of cells
      exhibiting less staphyloxanthin production. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested 
      that both A. polystachya and M. azedarach natural extracts are rich in bioactive 
      compounds, mainly limonoids, phenolics and oxygenated triterpenoids, which can
      combat MRSA biofilm infections and could be considered as promising sources of
      therapeutic cytotoxic, antibiofilm and anti-virulence agents.

TI  - Antioxidant, Antibacterial and Dyeing Potential of Crude Pigment Extract of
      Gonatophragmium triuniae and Its Chemical Characterization.
LID - 393 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27020393 [doi]
AB  - Filamentous fungi synthesize natural products as an ecological function. In this 
      study, an interesting indigenous fungus producing orange pigment exogenously was 
      investigated in detail as it possesses additional attributes along with colouring
      properties. An interesting fungus was isolated from a dicot plant, Maytenus
      rothiana. After a detailed study, the fungal isolate turned out to be a species
      of Gonatophragmium belonging to the family Acrospermaceae. Based on the
      morphological, cultural, and sequence-based phylogenetic analysis, the identity
      of this fungus was confirmed as Gonatophragmium triuniae. Although this fungus
      grows moderately, it produces good amounts of pigment on an agar medium. The
      fermented crude extract isolated from G. triuniae has shown antioxidant activity 
      with an IC50 value of 0.99 mg/mL and antibacterial activity against Gram-positive
      bacteria (with MIC of 3.91 mug/mL against Bacillus subtilis, and 15.6 mug/mL and 
      31.25 mug/mL for Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, respectively).
      Dyeing of cotton fabric mordanted with FeSO4 using crude pigment was found to be 
      satisfactory based on visual observation, suggesting its possible use in the
      textile industry. The orange pigment was purified from the crude extract by
      preparative HP-TLC. In addition, UV-Vis, FTIR, HRMS and NMR ((1)H NMR, (13)C
      NMR), COSY, and DEPT analyses revealed the orange pigment to be
      "1,2-dimethoxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one" (C14H11NO4, m/z 257). To our understanding,
      the present study is the first comprehensive report on Gonatophragmium triuniae
      as a potential pigment producer, reporting "1,2-dimethoxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one" as
      the main pigment from the crude hexane extract. Moreover, this is the first study
      reporting antioxidant, antibacterial, and dyeing potential of crude extract of G.
      triuniae, suggesting possible potential applications of pigments and other
      bioactive secondary metabolites of the G. triuniae in textile and pharmaceutical 
      industry.

TI  - The Influence of Polysaccharides/TiO2 on the Model Membranes of
      Dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol and Bacterial Lipids.
LID - 343 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27020343 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the bactericidal properties of popular
      medical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic ingredients, namely chitosan (Ch),
      hyaluronic acid (HA), and titanium dioxide (TiO2). The characteristics presented 
      in this paper are based on the Langmuir monolayer studies of the model biological
      membranes formed on subphases with these compounds or their mixtures. To prepare 
      the Langmuir film, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) (DPPG)
      phospholipid, which is the component of most bacterial membranes, as well as
      biological material-lipids isolated from bacteria Escherichia coli and
      Staphylococcus aureus were used. The analysis of the surface pressure-mean
      molecular area (pi-A) isotherms, compression modulus as a function of surface
      pressure, CS(-1) = f(pi), relative surface pressure as a function of time, pi/pi0
      = f(t), hysteresis loops, as well as structure visualized using a Brewster angle 
      microscope (BAM) shows clearly that Ch, HA, and TiO2 have antibacterial
      properties. Ch and TiO2 mostly affect S. aureus monolayer structure during
      compression. They can enhance the permeability of biological membranes leading to
      the bacteria cell death. In turn, HA has a greater impact on the thickness of E. 
      coli film.

      1,3,4-Thiadiazole-Based Molecules against Microbial Pathogens.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27020342 [doi]
AB  - A new series of 1,3,4-thiadiazoles was synthesized by the reaction of methyl
      2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene) hydrazine-1-carbodithioate (2) with selected
      derivatives of hydrazonoyl halide by grinding method at room temperature. The
      chemical structures of the newly synthesized derivatives were resolved from
      correct spectral and microanalytical data. Moreover, all synthesized compounds
      were screened for their antimicrobial activities using Escherichia coli,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus
      aureus, and Candida albicans. However, compounds 3 and 5 showed significant
      antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms. The other prepared
      compounds exhibited either only antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive
      bacteria like compounds 4 and 6, or only antifungal activity like compound 7. A
      molecular docking study of the compounds was performed against two important
      microbial enzymes: tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) and N-myristoyl transferase
      (Nmt). The tested compounds showed variety in binding poses and interactions.
      However, compound 3 showed the best interactions in terms of number of hydrogen
      bonds, and the lowest affinity binding energy (-8.4 and -9.1 kcal/mol,
      respectively). From the in vitro and in silico studies, compound 3 is a good
      candidate for the next steps of the drug development process as an antimicrobial 
      drug.

TI  - Human MAIT Cells Respond to Staphylococcus aureus with Enhanced Anti-Bacterial
      Activity.
LID - 148 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10010148 [doi]
AB  - Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells have been shown to play protective
      roles during infection with diverse pathogens through their propensity for rapid 
      innate-like cytokine production and cytotoxicity. Among the potential
      applications for MAIT cells is to defend against Staphylococcus aureus, a
      pathogen of serious clinical significance. However, it is unknown how MAIT cell
      responses to S. aureus are elicited, nor has it been investigated whether MAIT
      cell cytotoxicity is mobilized against intracellular S. aureus. In this study, we
      investigate the capacity of human MAIT cells to respond directly to S. aureus.
      MAIT cells co-cultured with dendritic cells (DCs) infected with S. aureus rapidly
      upregulate CD69, express IFNgamma and Granzyme B and degranulate. DC secretion of
      IL-12, but not IL-18, was implicated in this immune response, while TCR binding
      of MR1 is required to commence cytokine production. MAIT cell cytotoxicity
      resulted in apoptosis of S. aureus-infected cells, and reduced intracellular
      persistence of S. aureus. These findings implicate these unconventional T cells
      in important, rapid anti-S. aureus responses that may be of great relevance to
      the ongoing development of novel anti-S. aureus treatments.

TI  - High Frequency of the EMRSA-15 Clone (ST22-MRSA-IV) in Hospital Wastewater.
LID - 147 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10010147 [doi]
AB  - Hospital wastewaters often carry multidrug-resistant bacteria and priority
      pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Pathogens 
      and antibiotic resistance genes present in wastewaters may reach the natural
      environment facilitating their spread. Thus, we aimed to isolate MRSA from
      wastewater of 3 hospitals located in the north of Portugal and to characterize
      the isolates regarding the antimicrobial resistance and genetic lineages. A total
      of 96 wastewater samples were collected over six months. The water was filtered, 
      and the filtration membrane was immersed in BHI broth supplemented with 6.5% of
      NaCl and incubated. The inoculum was streaked in ORSAB agar plates for MRSA
      isolation. The isolates susceptibility testing was performed against 14
      antimicrobial agents. The presence of resistance and virulence genes was accessed
      by PCR. Molecular typing was performed in all isolates. From the 96 samples, 28
      (29.2%) were MRSA-positive. Most isolates had a multidrug-resistant profile and
      carried the mecA, blaZ, aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia, aph(3')-IIIa, ermA, ermB, ermC,
      tetL, tetM, dfrA dfrG and catpC221 genes. Most of the isolates were ascribed to
      the immune evasion cluster (IEC) type B. The isolates belonged to ST22-IV, ST8-IV
      and ST105-II and spa-types t747, t1302, t19963, t6966, t020, t008 and tOur study 
      shows that MRSA can be found over time in hospital wastewater. The wastewater
      treatment processes can reduce the MRSA load. The great majority of the isolates 
      belonged to ST22 and spa-type t747 which suggests the fitness of these genetic
      lineages in hospital effluents.

TI  - Bacteriophages: Combating Antimicrobial Resistance in Food-Borne Bacteria
      Prevalent in Agriculture.
LID - 46 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10010046 [doi]
AB  - Through recent decades, the subtherapeutic use of antibiotics within agriculture 
      has led to the widespread development of antimicrobial resistance. This problem
      not only impacts the productivity and sustainability of current agriculture but
      also has the potential to transfer antimicrobial resistance to human pathogens
      via the food supply chain. An increasingly popular alternative to antibiotics is 
      bacteriophages to control bacterial diseases. Their unique bactericidal
      properties make them an ideal alternative to antibiotics, as many countries begin
      to restrict the usage of antibiotics in agriculture. This review analyses recent 
      evidence from within the past decade on the efficacy of phage therapy on common
      foodborne pathogens, namely, Escherica coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella
      spp., and Campylobacter jejuni. This paper highlights the benefits and challenges
      of phage therapy and reveals the potential for phages to control bacterial
      populations both in food processing and livestock and the possibility for phages 
      to replace subtherapeutic usage of antibiotics in the agriculture sector.

      were isolated from silage, and the strain SSC-12 with the highest
      exopolysaccharide (EPS) production was used as the test strain. The SSC-12 was
      identified as Pediococcus pentosaceus, based upon 16S rDNA gene sequencing and
      Neighbor Joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis. The analysis of the kinetic results 
      of EPS generation of SSC-12 showed that the EPS generation reached the maximum
      value at 20 h of culture. The characterization study showed the EPS produced by
      SSC-12 was a homogeneous heteropolysaccharide comprising glucose (42.6%), mannose
      (28.9%), galactose (16.2%), arabinose (9.4%), and rhamnose (2.9%). The EPS had
      good antioxidant activity, especially the activity of scavenging hydroxyl free
      radicals. At the same time, the EPS also had strong antibacterial ability and
      could completely inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. The EPS produced by
      the Pediococcus pentosaceus SSC-12 can be used as a biologically active product
      with potential application prospects in the feed, food, and pharmaceutical
      industries.

AB  - The global health concern of antimicrobial resistance has harnessed research
      interest to find new classes of antibiotics to combat disease-causing pathogens. 
      In our studies, 3-halobenzo[b]thiophene derivatives were synthesized and tested
      for their antimicrobial activities using the broth microdilution susceptibility
      method. The 3-halo substituted benzo[b]thiophenes were synthesized starting from 
      2-alkynyl thioanisoles using a convenient electrophilic cyclization methodology
      that utilizes sodium halides as the source of electrophilic halogens when reacted
      along with copper(II) sulfate. This environmentally benign methodology is facile,
      uses ethanol as the solvent, and results in 3-halo substituted benzo[b]thiophene 
      structures in very high yields. The cyclohexanol-substituted 3-chloro and
      3-bromobenzo[b]thiophenes resulted in a low MIC of 16 microg/mL against
      Gram-positive bacteria and yeast. Additionally, in silico absorption,
      distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties of the compounds were
      determined. The compounds with the lowest MIC values showed excellent drug-like
      properties with no violations to Lipinski, Veber, and Muegge filters. The
      time-kill curve was obtained for cyclohexanol-substituted
      3-chlorobenzo[b]thiophenes against Staphylococcus aureus, which showed fast
      bactericidal activity at MIC.

      Silico Modeling, Formulation, and Characterization.
LID - 20 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15010020 [doi]
AB  - Inclusion complexation of rifampicin (RIF) with several types of cyclodextrins
      (betaCD, hydroxypropyl-betaCD, gammaCD, hydroxypropyl-gammaCD) in aqueous
      solutions at different pH values was investigated to assess the interactions
      between RIF and cyclodextrins (CDs). Molecular modeling was performed to
      determine the possible interactions between RIF and CDs at several pH values. The
      inclusion complexes were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry,
      Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffractometry, and
      scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, this study evaluated the dissolution
      profile and antibacterial activity of the formed complexes. Phase solubility
      analysis suggested the formation of RIF-CD affirmed 1:1 stoichiometry at all pH
      values (except RIF-betaCD at pH 4.0 and both betaCD and gammaCD at pH 9.0). The
      inclusion complexation of RIF with CD successfully increased the percentage of
      RIF released in in vitro studies. The inclusion complexes of RIF exhibited more
      than 60% of RIF released in 2 h which was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than
      release of pure RIF, which was only less than 10%. Antibacterial activity of
      RIF-CD complexes (measured by the minimum inhibitory concentration of RIF against
      Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) was lower 
      for both RIF-betaCD and RIF-HPgammaCD at pH 7.0 to pure RIF suspension. In
      conclusion, this work reports that both betaCD and gammaCD can be used to enhance
      the solubility of RIF and thus, improve the effectivity of RIF by decreasing the 
      required daily dose of RIF for the treatment of bacterial infections.

TI  - Ultraviolet-C Irradiation, Heat, and Storage as Potential Methods of Inactivating
      SARS-CoV-2 and Bacterial Pathogens on Filtering Facepiece Respirators.
LID - 83 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11010083 [doi]
AB  - The arrival of SARS-CoV-2 to Aotearoa/New Zealand in February 2020 triggered a
      massive response at multiple levels. Procurement and sustainability of medical
      supplies to hospitals and clinics during the then upcoming COVID-19 pandemic was 
      one of the top priorities. Continuing access to new personal protective equipment
      (PPE) was not guaranteed; thus, disinfecting and reusing PPE was considered as a 
      potential alternative. Here, we describe part of a local program intended to test
      and implement a system to disinfect PPE for potential reuse in New Zealand. We
      used filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) coupons inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 or
      clinically relevant multidrug-resistant pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii
      Ab5075, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus USA300 LAC and
      cystic-fibrosis isolate Pseudomonas aeruginosa LESB58), to evaluate the potential
      use of ultraviolet-C germicidal irradiation (UV-C) or dry heat treatment to
      disinfect PPE. An applied UV-C dose of 1000 mJ/cm(2) was sufficient to completely
      inactivate high doses of SARS-CoV-2; however, irregularities in the FFR coupons
      hindered the efficacy of UV-C to fully inactivate the virus, even at higher UV-C 
      doses (2000 mJ/cm(2)). Conversely, incubating contaminated FFR coupons at 65
      degrees C for 30 min or 70 degrees C for 15 min, was sufficient to block
      SARS-CoV-2 replication, even in the presence of mucin or a soil load (mimicking
      salivary or respiratory secretions, respectively). Dry heat (90 min at 75 degrees
      C to 80 degrees C) effectively killed 10(6) planktonic bacteria; however, even
      extending the incubation time up to two hours at 80 degrees C did not completely 
      kill bacteria when grown in colony biofilms. Importantly, we also showed that FFR
      material can harbor replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 for up to 35 days at room
      temperature in the presence of a soil load. We are currently using these findings
      to optimize and establish a robust process for decontaminating, reusing, and
      reducing wastage of PPE in New Zealand.

LID - 71 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11010071 [doi]
AB  - Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a condition with a complex and unclear aetiology.
      Possible causes of AD encompass alterations in the structure and function of the 
      epidermal barrier, disturbances in the skin microbiome, immune factors,
      allergens, bacterial and fungal infections as well as environmental and genetic
      factors. In patients with AD, acute skin lesions are colonized by a greater
      number of bacteria and fungi than chronic lesions, clinically unchanged atopic
      skin and the skin of healthy people. Mechanisms promoting skin colonization by
      pathogens include complex interplay among several factors. Apart from
      disturbances of the skin microbiome, increased adhesion in atopic skin, defects
      of innate immune response resulting in the lack of or restriction of growth of
      microorganisms also contribute to susceptibility to the skin colonization of and 
      infections, especially with Staphylococcus aureus. This review of the literature 
      attempts to identify factors that are involved in the pathogenesis of AD-related 
      bacterial and fungal skin colonization. Studies on the microbiome, commensal
      microorganisms and the role of skin microorganisms in maintaining healthy skin
      bring additional insight into the treatment and prevention of AD. In the light of
      presented mechanisms, reduction in colonization may become both causative and
      symptomatic treatment in AD.

TI  - What Does 16S rRNA Gene-Targeted Next Generation Sequencing Contribute to the
      Study of Infective Endocarditis in Heart-Valve Tissue?
LID - 34 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11010034 [doi]
AB  - Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe and life-threatening disease.
      Identification of infectious etiology is essential for establishing the
      appropriate antimicrobial treatment and decreasing mortality. The aim of this
      study was to explore the potential utility of metataxonomics for improving
      microbiological diagnosis of IE. Here, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the
      V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed in 27 heart valve tissues (18
      natives, 5 intravascular devices, and 4 prosthetics) from 27 patients diagnosed
      with IE (4 of them with negative blood cultures). Metataxonomics matched with
      conventional diagnostic techniques in 24/27 cases (88.9%). The same bacterial
      family was assigned to 24 cases; the same genus, to 23 cases; and the same
      species, to 13 cases. In 22 of them, the etiological agent was represented by
      percentages > 99% of the reads and in two cases, by ~70%. Staphylococcus aureus
      was detected in a previously microbiological undiagnosed patient. Thus,
      microbiological diagnosis with 16S rRNA gene targeted-NGS was possible in one
      more sample than using traditional techniques. The remaining two patients showed 
      no coincidence between traditional and 16S rRNA gene-targeted NGS microbiological
      diagnoses. In addition, 16S rRNA gene-targeted NGS allowed us to suggest
      coinfections that were supported by clinical data in one patient, and minority
      records also verified mixed infections in three cases. In our series,
      metataxonomics was valid for the identification of the causative agents, although
      more studies are needed before implementation of 16S rRNA gene-targeted NGS for
      the diagnosis of IE.

TI  - Inhibition of Zoonotic Pathogens Naturally Found in Pig Manure by Black Soldier
      Fly Larvae and Their Intestine Bacteria.
LID - 66 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects13010066 [doi]
AB  - Black soldier fly (BSF) larvae are often exposed to organic waste which harbors
      abundant zoonotic pathogens. We investigated the ability of BSF larvae to inhibit
      the zoonotic pathogens naturally found in pig manure. The zoonotic pathogens
      populations were detected by using selective medium during the conversion.
      Results showed that the viability of the zoonotic pathogens in pig manure was
      significantly affected. After eight days of conversion, the Coliform populations 
      were undetected, and Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp. decreased
      significantly on the eighth day. Antimicrobial assays of the purified recombinant
      defensin-like peptide 4 (DLP4) showed that this peptide exhibits inhibitory
      activity against S. aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and
      Escherichia coli in vitro. Bacteria BSF-CL and BSF-F were isolated from the
      larvae gut, and both inhibited the growth of S. aureus and E. coli, but
      Salmonella spp. was sensitive to the BSF-CL strain (but not to the BSF-F strain).
      The results from our experiments indicate that BSF larvae are capable of
      functionally inhibiting potential zoonotic pathogens in pig manure through a
      variety of mechanisms including antimicrobial peptides expression and the gut
      associate microorganisms. This study provides a theoretical basis for further
      study on the combined mechanism of BSF larvae immunity and its gut microbes
      against the zoonotic pathogens in pig manure.

TI  - MRSA Femoral Osteomyelitis from Superinfected Scabies Lesions: A Pediatric Case
      Report.
LID - 1007 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19021007 [doi]
AB  - Scabies is a skin infestation from the Sarcoptes scabiei. It is considered a
      public health issue causing concern in developing countries and is considered a
      "neglected tropical disease" by the World Health Organization (WHO). Scabies skin
      lesions may cause severe itching and can be the portal of entry for opportunistic
      and pathogenic bacteria, which can cause serious systemic infections. We report
      the case of a 3-year-old boy with recurrent scabies infections who presented to
      the emergency department because of a fever and refusal to walk. Blood tests
      showed neutrophilic leukocytosis and significantly increased C reactive protein
      (CRP) and procalcitonin. Upon medical examination, his right thigh was extremely 
      painful upon palpation, knee flexion was lost and he was unable to stand, so
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. MRI showed osteomyelitis of
      metaphysis and distal diaphysis of the right femur with associated subperiosteal 
      purulent collection and concomitant pyomyositis and fasciitis of the distal right
      thigh. Blood cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA). The patient received a long course of intravenous antibiotic
      therapy and his condition slowly improved. Follow-up femur X-ray showed a mixed
      pattern of erosion and sclerosis at the meta-diaphyseal region and periosteal
      reaction at the diaphyseal region. This case highlights the importance of early
      scabies diagnosis even in Western countries where poverty and household
      overcrowding are uncommon. Early diagnosis, timely initiation of proper treatment
      and evidence of clinical resolution are important elements to prevent recurrence 
      of infection and serious systemic superinfections even from multi-drug resistant 
      bacteria. Clinical consequences from unrecognized disease or inadequate
      eradication are preventable.

      Pathogens.
LID - 191 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12020191 [doi]
AB  - Resistance to antimicrobial agents in Gram-positive bacteria has become a major
      concern in the last decade. Recently, nanoparticles (NP) have emerged as a
      potential solution to antibiotic resistance. We synthesized three reduced
      graphene oxide (rGO) nanoparticles, namely rGO, rGO-S, and rGO-S/Se, and
      characterized them using X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Raman analysis, and
      thermogravimetric analysis. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed spherical 
      shape nanometer size S and S/Se NPs on the rGO surface. Antibacterial properties 
      of all three nanomaterials were probed against Gram-positive pathogens
      Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, using turbidometeric and CFU
      assays. Among the synthesized nanomaterials, rGO-S/Se exhibited relatively strong
      antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive microorganism tested in a
      concentration dependent manner (growth inhibition >90% at 200 mug/mL). Atomic
      force microscopy of rGO-S/Se treated cells displayed morphological aberrations.
      Our studies also revealed that rGO composite NPs are able to deposit on the
      bacterial cell surface, resulting in membrane perturbation and oxidative stress. 
      Taken together, our results suggest a possible three-pronged approach of
      bacterial cytotoxicity by these graphene-based materials.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23020948 [doi]
AB  - The main purpose of this review is to present justification for the urgent need
      to implement specific prophylaxis of invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections.
      We emphasize the difficulties in achieving this goal due to numerous S. aureus
      virulence factors important for the process of infection and the remarkable
      ability of these bacteria to avoid host defense mechanisms. We precede these
      considerations with a brief overview of the global necessitiy to intensify the
      use of vaccines against other pathogens as well, particularly in light of an
      impasse in antibiotic therapy. Finally, we point out global trends in research
      into modern technologies used in the field of molecular microbiology to develop
      new vaccines. We focus on the vaccines designed to fight the infections caused by
      S. aureus, which are often resistant to the majority of available therapeutic
      options.

TI  - eDNA Inactivation and Biofilm Inhibition by the PolymericBiocide
      Polyhexamethylene Guanidine Hydrochloride (PHMG-Cl).
LID - 731 [pii]

AB  - The choice of effective biocides used for routine hospital practice should
      consider the role of disinfectants in the maintenance and development of local
      resistome and how they might affect antibiotic resistance gene transfer within
      the hospital microbial population. Currently, there is little understanding of
      how different biocides contribute to eDNA release that may contribute to gene
      transfer and subsequent environmental retention. Here, we investigated how
      different biocides affect the release of eDNA from mature biofilms of two
      opportunistic model strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (PA) and
      Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (SA) and contribute to the hospital resistome in
      the form of surface and water contaminants and dust particles. The effect of four
      groups of biocides, alcohols, hydrogen peroxide, quaternary ammonium compounds,
      and the polymeric biocide polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (PHMG-Cl),
      was evaluated using PA and SA biofilms. Most biocides, except for PHMG-Cl and 70%
      ethanol, caused substantial eDNA release, and PHMG-Cl was found to block biofilm 
      development when used at concentrations of 0.5% and 0.1%. This might be
      associated with the formation of DNA-PHMG-Cl complexes as PHMG-Cl is predicted to
      bind to AT base pairs by molecular docking assays. PHMG-Cl was found to bind
      high-molecular DNA and plasmid DNA and continued to inactivate DNA on surfaces
      even after 4 weeks. PHMG-Cl also effectively inactivated biofilm-associated
      antibiotic resistance gene eDNA released by a pan-drug-resistant Klebsiella
      strain, which demonstrates the potential of a polymeric biocide as a new
      surface-active agent to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance in hospital
      settings.

TI  - Antimicrobial Food Packaging Based on Prodigiosin-Incorporated Double-Layered
      Bacterial Cellulose and Chitosan Composites.
LID - 315 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14020315 [doi]
AB  - Nowadays, food packaging systems have shifted from a passive to an active role in
      which the incorporation of antimicrobial compounds into biopolymers can promote a
      sustainable way to reduce food spoilage and its environmental impact.
      Accordingly, composite materials based on oxidized-bacterial cellulose (BC) and
      poly(vinyl alcohol)-chitosan (PVA-CH) nanofibers were produced by needleless
      electrospinning and functionalized with the bacterial pigment prodigiosin (PG).
      Two strategies were explored, in the first approach PG was incorporated in the
      electrospun PVA-CH layer, and TEMPO-oxidized BC was the substrate for nanofibers 
      deposition (BC/PVA-CH_PG composite). In the second approach, TEMPO-oxidized BC
      was functionalized with PG, and afterward, the PVA-CH layer was electrospun
      (BC_PG/PVA-CH composite). The double-layer composites obtained were characterized
      and the nanofibrous layers displayed smooth fibers with average diameters of
      139.63 +/- 65.52 nm and 140.17 +/- 57.04 nm, with and without pigment
      incorporation, respectively. FTIR-ATR analysis confirmed BC oxidation and
      revealed increased intensity at specific wavelengths, after pigment
      incorporation. Moreover, the moderate hydrophilic behavior, as well as the high
      porosity exhibited by each layer, remained mostly unaffected after PG
      incorporation. The composites' mechanical performance and the water vapor
      transmission rate (WVTR) evaluation indicated the suitability of the materials
      for certain food packaging solutions, especially for fresh products.
      Additionally, the red color provided by the bacterial pigment PG on the external 
      surface of a food packaging material is also a desirable effect, to attract the
      consumers' attention, creating a multifunctional material. Furthermore, the
      antimicrobial activity was evaluated and, PVA-CH_PG, and BC_PG layers exhibited
      the highest antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa. Thus, the fabricated composites can be considered for application in 
      active food packaging, owing to PG antimicrobial potential, to prevent foodborne 
      pathogens (with PG incorporated into the inner layer of the food packaging
      material, BC/PVA-CH_PG composite), but also to prevent external contamination, by
      tackling the exterior of food packaging materials (with PG added to the outer
      layer, BC_PG/PVA-CH composite).

TI  - Electrospun Nanofibrous Membranes Based on Citric Acid-Functionalized Chitosan
      Containing rGO-TEPA with Potential Application in Wound Dressings.
LID - 294 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14020294 [doi]
AB  - The present research work is focused on the design and investigation of
      electrospun composite membranes based on citric acid-functionalized chitosan
      (CsA) containing reduced graphene oxide-tetraethylene pentamine (CsA/rGO-TEPA) as
      materials with opportune bio-properties for applications in wound dressings. The 
      covalent functionalization of chitosan (CS) with citric acid (CA) was achieved
      through the EDC/NHS coupling system and was checked by (1)H-NMR spectroscopy and 
      FTIR spectrometry. The mixtures to be electrospun were formulated by adding three
      concentrations of rGO-TEPA into the 1/1 (w/w) CsA/poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO)
      solution. The effect of rGO-TEPA concentration on the morphology, wettability,
      thermal stability, cytocompatibility, cytotoxicity, and anti-biofilm activity of 
      the nanofibrous membranes was extensively investigated. FTIR and Raman results
      confirmed the covalent and non-covalent interactions that appeared between the
      system's compounds, and the exfoliation of rGO-TEPA sheets within the CsA in the 
      presence of PEO (CsA/P) polymer matrix, respectively. SEM analysis emphasized the
      nanofibrous architecture of membranes and the presence of rGO-TEPA sheets
      entrapped into the CsA nanofiber structure. The MTT cellular viability assay
      showed a good cytocompatibility with the highest level of cell development and
      proliferation registered for the CsA/P composite nanofibrous membrane with 0.250 
      wt.% rGO-TEPA. The designed nanofibrous membranes could have potential
      applications in wound dressings, given that they showed a good anti-biofilm
      activity against Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive
      Staphylococcus aureus bacterial strains.

TI  - Iodine Immobilized UiO-66-NH2 Metal-Organic Framework as an Effective
      Antibacterial Additive for Poly(epsilon-caprolactone).
LID - 283 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14020283 [doi]
AB  - Iodine has been widely used as an effective disinfectant with broad-spectrum
      antimicrobial potency. However, the application of iodine in an antibacterial
      polymer remains challenging due to its volatile nature and poor solubility.
      Herein, iodine immobilized UiO-66-NH2 metal-organic framework (MOF) (UiO66@I2)
      with a high loading capacity was synthesized and used as an effective
      antibacterial additive for poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL). An orthogonal design
      approach was used to achieve the optimal experiments' conditions in iodine
      adsorption. UiO66@I2 nanoparticles were added to the PCL matrix under ultrasonic 
      vibration and evaporated the solvent to get a polymer membrane. The composites
      were characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR, and static contact angle analysis.
      UiO-66-NH2 nanoparticles have a high iodine loading capacity, up to 18 wt.%. The 
      concentration of iodine is the most important factor in iodine adsorption. Adding
      0.5 wt.% or 1.0 wt.% (equivalent iodine content) of UiO66@I2 to the PCL matrix
      had no influence on the structure of PCL but reduces the static water angle. The 
      PCL composites showed strong antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus
      aureus and Escherichia coli. In contrast, the same content of free iodine/PCL
      composites had no antibacterial activity. The difference in the antibacterial
      performance was due to the different iodine contents in the polymer composites.
      It was found that MOF nanoparticles could retain most of the iodine during the
      sample preparation and storage, while there was few iodine left in the free
      iodine/PCL composites. This study offers a common and simple way to immobilize
      iodine and prepare antibacterial polymers with low antiseptic content that would 
      reduce the influence of an additive on polymers' physical properties.

TI  - Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Novel Antimicrobial Polymers Based on the
      Inclusion of Polyethylene Glycol/TiO2 Nanocomposites in Cyclodextrin as Drug
      Carriers for Sulfaguanidine.
LID - 227 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14020227 [doi]
AB  - Polymers and their composites have recently attracted attention in both
      pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a
      versatile polymer extensively used in medicine. Herein, three novel PEG-based
      polymers that are pseudopolyrotaxane (PEG/alpha-CD) (1), titania-nanocomposite
      (PEG/TiO2NPs) (2), and pseudopolyrotaxane-titania-nanocomposite
      (PEG/alpha-CD/TiO2NPs) (3), were synthesized and characterized. The chemical
      structure, surface morphology, and optical properties of the newly materials were
      examined by FT-IR, (1)H-NMR, SEM, and UV-Vis., respectively. The prepared
      polymers were used as drug carriers of sulfaguanidine as PEG/alpha-CD/Drug (4),
      PEG/TiO2NPs/Drug (5), and PEG/alpha-CD/TiO2NPs/Drug (6). The influence of these
      drug-carrying formulations on the physical and chemical characteristics of
      sulfaguanidine including pharmacokinetic response, solubility, and tissue
      penetration was explored. Evaluation of the antibacterial and antibiofilm effect 
      of sulfaguanidine was tested before and after loading onto the prepared polymers 
      against some Gram-negative and positive bacteria (E. coli, Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)), as well. The results of this work 
      turned out to be very promising as they confirmed that loading sulfaguanidine to 
      the newly designed polymers not only showed superior antibacterial and
      antibiofilm efficacy compared to the pure drug, but also modified the properties 
      of the sulfaguanidine drug itself.

      Carbon Dioxide towards Antibiofilm Properties.
LID - 33 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/membranes12010033 [doi]
AB  - The study explores the grafting of cellulose acetate microfiltration membranes
      with an aminosilane to attain antibiofilm properties. The grafting reaction was
      performed in the supercritical carbon dioxide used as a transport and reaction
      medium. The FTIR analyses and dissolution tests confirmed the covalent bonding
      between the aminosilane and polymer. The membranes' microstructure was
      investigated using a dual-beam SEM and ion microscopy, and no adverse effects of 
      the processing were found. The modified membranes showed a more hydrophilic
      nature and larger water permeate flow rate than the neat cellulose acetate
      membranes. The tests in a cross-filtration unit showed that modified membranes
      were considerably less blocked after a week of exposure to Staphylococcus aureus 
      and Escherichia coli than the original ones. Microbiological investigations
      revealed strong antibiofilm properties of the grafted membranes in experiments
      with Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and
      Salmonella Enteritidis.

TI  - Novel Bovine Plasma Protein Film Reinforced with Nanofibrillated Cellulose Fiber 
      as Edible Food Packaging Material.
LID - 31 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/membranes12010031 [doi]
AB  - Proteins, such as those in blood from slaughterhouses, are a good option for
      developing edible films. However, films made exclusively from proteins have low
      strength and high water solubility, which makes them difficult to use in the food
      industry. The use of cellulosic material, such as nanofibrillated cellulose
      (NFC), can improve the properties of these films. In the present work, bovine
      plasma was acidified and treated with ethanol to precipitate its proteins, and
      these proteins were used to prepare films reinforced with several concentrations 
      of NFC. In addition, control films prepared with untreated bovine plasma and
      reinforced with NFC were prepared as well. These new edible films were
      characterized according to their mechanical properties, water vapor permeability,
      light transmittance, and microstructure. Furthermore, the film with the best
      properties was selected to be additivated with nisin to test its antimicrobial
      properties by wrapping meat previously contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus.
      In this sense, films prepared with the extracted proteins showed better
      properties than the films prepared with untreated plasma. In addition, the
      results showed that the reinforcement of the films with a 10% (w/w) of NFC
      decreased their water solubility and improved their puncture strength and water
      vapor barrier properties. Finally, the addition of nisin to the films prepared
      with extracted protein from bovine plasma and NFC gave them antimicrobial
      properties against S. aureus.

TI  - Major Surgical Trauma Impairs the Function of Natural Killer Cells but Does Not
      Affect Monocyte Cytokine Synthesis.
LID - 13 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12010013 [doi]
AB  - Major traumatic and surgical injury increase the risk for infectious
      complications due to immune dysregulation. Upon stimulation with interleukin (IL)
      12 by monocyte/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells release interferon (IFN)
      gamma that supports the elimination of the pathogen. In the present study, we
      investigated the impact of invasive spine surgery on the relationship between
      monocytes and NK cells upon exposure to Staphylococcus aureus. Mononuclear cells 
      and serum were isolated from peripheral blood of patients before and up to 8 d
      after surgery and stimulated with inactivated S. aureus bacteria. NK cell and
      monocyte function were determined by flow cytometry. NK cells continuously lost
      their ability to produce IFN-gamma during the first week after surgery
      independently from monocyte-derived IL-12 secretion. IFN-gamma synthesis was
      minimal on day 8 and was associated with decreased expression of the IL-12
      receptor and activation of transcription factors required for IFNG gene
      transcription. Addition of recombinant IL-12 could at least partially restore NK 
      cell function. Pre-operative levels of growth/differentiation factor (GDF) 15 in 
      the serum correlated with the extent of NK cell suppression and with
      hospitalization. Thus, NK cell suppression after major surgery might represent a 
      therapeutic target to improve the immune defense against opportunistic
      infections.

TI  - Recent Developments in Phenotypic and Molecular Diagnostic Methods for
      Antimicrobial Resistance Detection in Staphylococcus aureus: A Narrative Review.
LID - 208 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12010208 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for a wide range
      of infections in humans, such as skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, food
      poisoning or sepsis. Historically, S. aureus was able to rapidly adapt to
      anti-staphylococcal antibiotics and become resistant to several classes of
      antibiotics. Today, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a
      multidrug-resistant pathogen and is one of the most common bacteria responsible
      for hospital-acquired infections and outbreaks, in community settings as well.
      The rapid and accurate diagnosis of antimicrobial resistance in S. aureus is
      crucial to the early initiation of directed antibiotic therapy and to improve
      clinical outcomes for patients. In this narrative review, I provide an overview
      of recent phenotypic and molecular diagnostic methods for antimicrobial
      resistance detection in S. aureus, with a particular focus on MRSA detection. I
      consider methods for resistance detection in both clinical samples and isolated
      S. aureus cultures, along with a brief discussion of the advantages and the
      challenges of implementing such methods in routine diagnostics.

TI  - Emerging Links between Microbiome Composition and Skin Immunology in Diaper
      Dermatitis: A Narrative Review.
LID - 112 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/children9010112 [doi]
AB  - Diaper dermatitis is a common type of irritant contact dermatitis occurring in
      infants and toddlers. Its occurrence is triggered by an unfavorable environment
      under the diaper, damage to skin integrity by fecal enzyme degradation,
      overhydration and disruption of the lipid bilayer structure facilitating the
      entry of irritants and microorganisms. In diaper dermatitis development, the
      central proinflammatory cytokines are IL-1alpha, IL-8 and TNF-alpha. The initial 
      release of IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha starts a further cascade of pro-inflammatory
      chemo- and cytokines, resulting in inflammation and erythema of the skin. A
      recently recognized factor in diaper dermatitis is the composition of the skin
      microbiome; common pathogenic strains Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus 
      are associated with skin irritation. The resulting impaired microbiome
      composition produces a local inflammatory response and may thus worsen the
      initial dermatitis clinical presentation and subsequent healing. Introduction of 
      probiotics is an attractive treatment for microbiome modulation, which has shown 
      success in other skin conditions in adults and children. Probiotics are thought
      to work as a protective shield against irritants, maintain low skin pH, secrete
      beneficial metabolites, and block pathogen invasion. There is preliminary
      evidence that certain probiotics given orally or topically could be used as a
      gentle intervention in diaper dermatitis.

TI  - Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Benzo[b]thiophene Acylhydrazones as
      Antimicrobial Agents against Multidrug-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
LID - 131 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12010131 [doi]
AB  - The benzo[b]thiophene nucleus and the acylhydrazone functional group were
      combined to prepare three new series of compounds for screening against
      Staphylococcus aureus. The reaction of substituted benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxylic
      hydrazide and various aromatic or heteroaromatic aldehydes led to a collection of
      26 final products with extensive structural diversification on the aromatic ring 
      and on position 6 of the benzo[b]thiophene nucleus. The screening lead to the
      identification of eight hits, including
      (E)-6-chloro-N'-(pyridin-2-ylmethylene)benzo[b]thiophene-2-carbohydrazide (II.b),
      a non-cytotoxic derivative showing a minimal inhibitory concentration of 4
      microg/mL on three S. aureus strains, among which were a reference classical
      strain and two clinically isolated strains resistant to methicillin and
      daptomycin, respectively.

TI  - A Time-Course Study on a Food Contact Material (FCM)-Certified Coating Based on
      Titanium Oxide Deposited onto Aluminum.
LID - 97 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biology11010097 [doi]
AB  - Aluminum is the second most widely used metal worldwide. It is present as an
      additive in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food, and food contact materials (FCM).
      In this study, we confirm the bactericidal effect of a special anodizing method, 
      based on TiO2 nanoparticles (DURALTI((R))) deposited on aluminum disks with
      different roughness and subjected to two sanitizing treatments: UV and alcohol
      70%. Consequently, we perform a time-course evaluation against both Gram-negative
      and Gram-positive bacteria to better frame the time required to achieve the best 
      result. Approximately 10(6) CFU/mL of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922; Salmonella
      Typhimurium ATCC 1402; Yersinia enterocolitica ATCC 9610; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      ATCC 27588; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212;
      Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 and Listeria monocytogenes NCTT 10888 were inoculated 
      onto each aluminum surface and challenged with UV and alcohol 70% at 0, 15", 30",
      1', 5', 15', 30', 1, 2, 4 and 6 h. DURALTI((R)) coating already confirmed its
      ability to induce a 4-logarithmic decrease (from 10(6) to 10(2) CFU/mL) after 6
      h. Once each sanitizing treatment was applied, an overall bacterial inhibition
      occurred in a time ranging from 15'' to 1'. The results are innovative in terms
      of preventing microbial adhesion and growth in the food industry.

TI  - Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus from Peninsular Malaysian Animal
      Handlers: Molecular Profile, Antimicrobial Resistance, Immune Evasion Cluster and
      Genotypic Categorization.
LID - 103 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11010103 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infections, particularly methicillin-resistant 
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in humans and animals, have become a significant
      concern globally. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence and
      antibiogram of S. aureus isolated from animal handlers in Peninsular Malaysia.
      Furthermore, the genotypic characteristics of S. aureus isolates were also
      investigated. Nasal and oral swab samples were collected from 423 animal handlers
      in Peninsular Malaysia. The antibiogram profiles of S. aureus against 18
      antibiotics were established using a Kirby-Bauer test. The genotypic profile of
      S. aureus, including the presence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), virulence
      genes and spa genotypes, was investigated using molecular techniques. The overall
      carriage rate of S. aureus, MRSA and MDRSA was 30.5%, 1.2% and 19.4%,
      respectively. S. aureus was highly resistant against penicillin (72.3%) and
      amoxicillin (52.3%). Meanwhile, gentamicin and linezolid were fully effective
      against all the isolated S. aureus from animal handlers. It was observed that
      animal handlers with close exposure to poultry were more likely to carry S.
      aureus that is resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin. S. aureus isolates
      harboured tetracycline resistance (tetK, tetL and tetM), erythromycin resistance 
      (ermA, ermB, ermC and msrA) and immune evasion cluster (IEC) genes (scn, chp,
      sak, sea and sep). Seventeen different spa types were detected among the 30
      isolates of MDRSA, with t189 (16.7%) and t4171 (16.7%) being the predominant spa 
      type, suggesting wide genetic diversity of the MDRSA isolates. The present study 
      demonstrated the prevalence of S. aureus strains, including MRSA and MDRSA with
      various antimicrobial resistance and genetic profiles from animal handlers in
      Peninsular Malaysia.

      to estimate the AUC. This study examined the usefulness of AUC estimation via
      trough concentration (Cmin)-only sampling of 260 adults infected with
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) who received vancomycin. The
      exact Cmin sampling time was used for Bayesian estimation. A significantly higher
      early treatment response was observed in patients with a day 2 AUC >/= 400
      microg.h/mL than those with <400 microg.h/mL, and a significantly higher early
      nephrotoxicity rate was observed in patients with a day 2 AUC >/= 600 microg.h/mL
      than those with <600 microg.h/mL. These AUC cutoff values constituted independent
      factors for each outcome. In sub-analysis, the discrimination ability for early
      clinical outcomes using these AUC cutoffs was confirmed only in patients with q12
      vancomycin administration. A significant difference in early treatment response
      using the 400 microg.h/mL cutoff was obtained only in patients with low-risk
      infections. The usefulness of the vancomycin AUC target to decrease
      nephrotoxicity while assuring clinical efficacy was even confirmed with a single 
      Cmin measurement. However, assessment with two samples might be required in
      patients with q24 administration or high/moderate-risk MRSA infections.

TI  - Antimicrobial Photosensitizing Material Based on Conjugated Zn(II) Porphyrins.
LID - 91 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11010091 [doi]
AB  - The widespread use of antibiotics has led to a considerable increase in the
      resistance of microorganisms to these agents. Consequently, it is imminent to
      establish new strategies to combat pathogens. An alternative involves the
      development of photoactive polymers that represent an interesting strategy to
      kill microbes and maintain aseptic surfaces. In this sense, a conjugated polymer 
      (PZnTEP) based on Zn(II) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis-[4-(ethynyl)phenyl]porphyrin (ZnTEP)
      was obtained by the homocoupling reaction of terminal alkyne groups. PZnTEP
      exhibits a microporous structure with high surface areas allowing better
      interaction with bacteria. The UV-visible absorption spectra show the Soret and Q
      bands of PZnTEP red-shifted by about 18 nm compared to those of the monomer.
      Also, the conjugate presents the two red emission bands, characteristic of
      porphyrins. This polymer was able to produce singlet molecular oxygen and
      superoxide radical anion in the presence of NADH. Photocytotoxic activity
      sensitized by PZnTEP was investigated in bacterial suspensions. No viable
      Staphylococcus aureus cells were detected using 0.5 microM PZnTEP and 15 min
      irradiation. Under these conditions, complete photoinactivation of Escherichia
      coli was observed in the presence of 100 mM KI. Likewise, no survival was
      detected for E. coli incubated with 1.0 microM PZnTEP after 30 min irradiation.
      Furthermore, polylactic acid surfaces coated with PZnTEP were able to kill
      efficiently these bacteria. This surface can be reused for at least three
      photoinactivation cycles. Therefore, this conjugated photodynamic polymer is an
      interesting antimicrobial photoactive material for designing and developing
      self-sterilizing surfaces.

LID - 86 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11010086 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing was established in the
      2000s and has been employed as a tool for the molecular epidemiology of
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, as well as the evolution
      investigation of Staphylococcus species. Molecular cloning and the conventional
      sequencing of SCCmec have been adopted to verify the presence and structure of a 
      novel SCCmec type, while convenient PCR-based SCCmec identification methods have 
      been used in practical settings for many years. In addition, whole-genome
      sequencing has been widely used, and various SCCmec and similar structures have
      been recently identified in various species. The current status of the SCCmec
      types, SCCmec subtypes, rules for nomenclature, and multiple methods for
      identifying SCCmec types and subtypes were summarized in this review, according
      to the perspective of the International Working Group on the Classification of
      Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome Elements.

TI  - The Triprenylated Anthranoid Ferruginin A, a Promising Scaffold for the
      Development of Novel Antibiotics against Gram-Positive Bacteria.
LID - 84 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11010084 [doi]
AB  - In today's post-antibiotic era, the search for new antimicrobial compounds is of 
      major importance and nature represents one of the primary sources of bioactive
      molecules. In this work, through a cheminformatics approach, we clustered an
      in-house library of natural products and their derivatives based on a combination
      of fingerprints and substructure search. We identified the prenylated
      emodine-type anthranoid ferruginin A as a novel antimicrobial compound. We tested
      its ability to inhibit and kill a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative
      bacteria, and compared its activity with that of two analogues, vismione B and
      ferruanthrone. Furthermore, the capability of these three anthranoids to disrupt 
      staphylococcal biofilm was investigated, as well as their effect on the viability
      of human keratinocytes. Ferruginin A showed a potent activity against both the
      planktonic and biofilm forms of Gram-positive bacteria (i.e., Staphylococcus
      aureus and S. epidermidis) and had the best therapeutic index compared to
      vismione B and ferruanthrone. In conclusion, ferruginin A represents a promising 
      scaffold for the further development of valuable antimicrobial agents.

TI  - Role of Bioaerosols on the Short-Distance Transmission of Multidrug-Resistant
      Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a Chicken Farm Environment.
LID - 81 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11010081 [doi]
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a dynamic and tenacious
      pathogenic bacterium which is prevalent in livestock farming environments. This
      study investigated the possibility of MRSA spread via bioaerosol transmission
      from an indoor chicken farm environment to outdoors downwind (up to 50 m). The
      concentration of total airborne bacteria colony formation units (CFUs) was
      decreased with increasing sampling distance ranging from 9.18 x 10(1) to 3.67 x
      10(3) per air volume (m(3)). Among the 21 MRSA isolates, 15 were isolated from
      indoor chicken sheds and exposure square areas, whereas 6 were isolated from
      downwind bioaerosol samples. Molecular characterization revealed that all of them
      carried the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) VIII, and they were
      remarkably linked with the hospital-associated MRSA group. Spa typing analysis
      determined that all MRSA isolates belonged to spa type t002. Virulence analysis
      showed that 100% of total isolates possessed exfoliative toxin A (eta), whereas
      38.09% and 23.80% strains carried exfoliative toxin B (etb) and enterotoxin A
      (entA). Additionally, all of these MRSA isolates carried multidrug resistance
      properties and showed their resistance against chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin,
      clindamycin, tetracycline, and erythromycin. In addition, chi-squared statistical
      analysis displayed a significant distributional relationship of gene phenotypes
      between MRSA isolates from chicken farm indoor and downwind bioaerosol samples.
      The results of this study revealed that chicken farm indoor air might act as a
      hotspot of MRSA local community-level outbreak, wherein the short-distance
      dispersal of MRSA could be supported by bioaerosols.

TI  - In Vitro and In Silico Approaches for the Evaluation of Antimicrobial Activity,
      Time-Kill Kinetics, and Anti-Biofilm Potential of Thymoquinone
      (2-Methyl-5-propan-2-ylcyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione) against Selected Human
      Pathogens.
LID - 79 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11010079 [doi]
AB  - Thymoquinone (2-methyl-5-propan-2-ylcyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione; TQ), a
      principal bioactive phytoconstituent of Nigella sativa essential oil, has been
      reported to have high antimicrobial potential. Thus, the current study evaluated 
      TQ's antimicrobial potential against a range of selected human pathogens using in
      vitro assays, including time-kill kinetics and anti-biofilm activity. In silico
      molecular docking of TQ against several antimicrobial target proteins and a
      detailed intermolecular interaction analysis was performed, including binding
      energies and docking feasibility. Of the tested bacteria and fungi, S.
      epidermidis ATCC 12228 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were the most susceptible 
      to TQ, with 50.3 +/- 0.3 mm and 21.1 +/- 0.1 mm zones of inhibition,
      respectively. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of TQ are in the
      range of 12.5-50 microg/mL, while minimum biocidal concentration (MBC) values are
      in the range of 25-100 microg/mL against the tested organisms. Time-kill kinetics
      of TQ revealed that the killing time for the tested bacteria is in the range of
      1-6 h with the MBC of TQ. Anti-biofilm activity results demonstrate that the
      minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) values of TQ are in the range of 
      25-50 microg/mL, while the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC)
      values are in the range of 25-100 microg/mL, for the tested bacteria. In silico
      molecular docking studies revealed four preferred antibacterial and antifungal
      target proteins for TQ: D-alanyl-D-alanine synthetase (Ddl) from Thermus
      thermophilus, transcriptional regulator qacR from Staphylococcus aureus,
      N-myristoyltransferase from Candida albicans, and NADPH-dependent D-xylose
      reductase from Candida tenuis. In contrast, the nitroreductase family protein
      from Bacillus cereus and spore coat polysaccharide biosynthesis protein from
      Bacillus subtilis and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase from Aspergillus 
      fumigatus are the least preferred antibacterial and antifungal target proteins
      for TQ, respectively. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that TQ could 
      bind to all four target proteins, with Ddl and NADPH-dependent D-xylose reductase
      being the most efficient. Our findings corroborate TQ's high antimicrobial
      potential, suggesting it may be a promising drug candidate for multi-drug
      resistant (MDR) pathogens, notably Gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans.

TI  - Antimicrobial Peptides Epinecidin-1 and Beta-Defesin-3 Are Effective against a
      Broad Spectrum of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacterial Isolates and Increase Survival
      Rate in Experimental Sepsis.
LID - 76 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11010076 [doi]
AB  - The antimicrobial peptides human Beta-defensin-3 (hBD-3) and Epinecidin-1 (Epi-1;
      by Epinephelus coioides) could be a promising tool to develop novel
      antibacterials to combat antibiotic resistance. The antibacterial activity of
      Epi-1 + vancomycin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (22
      isolates) and Epi-1 + hBD-3 against carbapenem-resistant isolates of Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (n = 23),&nbsp;Klebsiella aerogenes (n = 17), Acinetobacter baumannii 
      (n = 9), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 13) was studied in vitro. To evaluate
      the in vivo efficacy of hBD-3 and Epi-1, ICR (CD-1) mice were injected
      intraperitoneally with a lethal dose of K. pneumoniae or P. aeruginosa. The
      animals received a single injection of either sterile saline, hBD-3 monotherapy, 
      meropenem monotherapy, hBD-3 + meropenem, or hBD-3 + Epi-1. Studied peptides
      showed antibacterial activity in vitro against all studied clinical isolates in a
      concentration of 2 to 32 mg/L. In both experimental models of murine sepsis, an
      increase in survival rate was seen with hBD-3 monotherapy, hBD-3 + meropenem, and
      hBD-3 + Epi-1. For K.&nbsp;pneumoniae-sepsis, hBD-3 was shown to be a promising
      option in overcoming the resistance of Klebsiella spp. to carbapenems, though
      more research is needed. In the P. aeruginosa-sepsis model, the addition of Epi-1
      to hBD-3 was found to have a slightly reduced mortality rate compared to hBD-3
      monotherapy.

      Infection in a Bioluminescent Mouse Model.
LID - 65 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11010065 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we investigated the potential of an analogue of robenidine
      (NCL179) to expand its chemical diversity for the treatment of
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. We show that NCL179 exhibits
      potent bactericidal activity, returning minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum 
      bactericidal concentrations (MICs/MBCs) of 1-2 microg/mL against
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MICs/MBCs of 1-2 microg/mL against
      methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius and MICs/MBCs of 2-4 microg/mL against 
      vancomycin-resistant enterococci. NCL179 showed synergistic activity against
      clinical isolates and reference strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia
      coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of
      sub-inhibitory concentrations of colistin, whereas NCL179 alone had no activity. 
      Mice given oral NCL179 at 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg (4 x doses, 4 h apart) showed no 
      adverse clinical effects and no observable histological effects in any of the
      organs examined. In a bioluminescent S. aureus sepsis challenge model, mice that 
      received four oral doses of NCL179 at 50 mg/kg at 4 h intervals exhibited
      significantly reduced bacterial loads, longer survival times and higher overall
      survival rates than the vehicle-only treated mice. These results support NCL179
      as a valid candidate for further development to treat MDR bacterial infections as
      a stand-alone antibiotic or in combination with existing antibiotic classes.

TI  - Long-Term Outcomes in Patients on Life-Long Antibiotics: A Five-Year Cohort
      Study.
LID - 62 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11010062 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impacts at an individual level of long-term
      antibiotic consumption. We explored health outcomes of long-term antibiotic
      therapy prescribed to a cohort of patients to suppress infections deemed
      incurable. METHODS: We conducted a 5-year longitudinal study of patients on
      long-term antibiotics at Monash Health, a metropolitan tertiary-level hospital
      network in Australia. Adults prescribed antibiotics for >12 months to suppress
      chronic infection or prevent recurrent infection were included. A retrospective
      review of medical records and a descriptive analysis was conducted. RESULTS:
      Twenty-seven patients were followed up during the study period, from 29 patients 
      originally identified in Monash Health in 2014. Seven of the 27 patients (26%)
      died from causes unrelated to the suppressed infection, six (22%) ceased
      long-term antibiotic therapy and two (7%) required treatment modification.
      Fifteen (56%) were colonised with multiresistant microorganisms, including
      vancomycin resistant Enterococci, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
      and carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaciae. CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights
      the potential pitfalls of long-term antibiotic therapy, and the frailty of this
      cohort, who are often ineligible for definitive curative therapy.

TI  - Phytocompound Mediated Blockage of Quorum Sensing Cascade in ESKAPE Pathogens.
LID - 61 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11010061 [doi]
AB  - Increased resistance of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter sp.
      (ESKAPE) pathogens against various drugs has enhanced the urge for the
      development of alternate therapeutics. Quorum sensing (QS) is a density dependent
      cell-to-cell communication mechanism responsible for controlling pathogenicity
      with the regulation of gene expression. Thus, QS is considered a potential target
      for the development of newer anti-biofilm agents that do not depend on the
      utilization of antibiotics. Compounds with anti-QS effects are known as QS
      inhibitors (QSIs), and they can inhibit the QS mechanism that forms the major
      form in the development of bacterial pathogenesis. A diverse array of natural
      compounds provides a plethora of anti-QS effects. Over recent years, these
      natural compounds have gained importance as new strategies for combating the
      ESKAPE pathogens and inhibiting the genes involved in QS. Different
      pharmacognostical and pharmacological studies have been carried out so far for
      identification of novel drugs or for the discovery of their unique structures
      that may help in developing more effective anti-biofilm therapies. The main
      objective of this review is to discuss the various natural compounds, so far
      identified and their employed mechanisms in hindering the genes responsible for
      QS leading to bacterial pathogenesis.

TI  - Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria on Healthcare Workers' Uniforms in Hospitals and
      Long-Term Care Facilities in Cyprus.
LID - 49 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11010049 [doi]
AB  - Healthcare workers' (HCW) clothing has been shown to harbor multidrug-resistant
      bacteria (MDRB) and may contribute to transmission. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate presence of MDRB on HCW uniforms in Cyprus. A cross-sectional study was 
      carried out in 9 hospital wards and 7 long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in
      Nicosia, Cyprus, from April-August 2019. Sampling of HCW uniform pockets was
      conducted at the end of the first shift. Personal hygiene and other habits were
      recorded during personal interviews. Among 140 sampled HCW (69 from hospitals, 71
      from LTCFs), 37 MDRB were identified, including 16 vancomycin-resistant
      enterococci (VRE), 15 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 5
      extended spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria, and 1
      carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Presence of MDRB was higher in
      LTCFs compared to hospitals (p = 0.03). Higher MDRB rates in uniforms were noted 
      in HCWs that worked <1 year (41.7% vs. 21.1%) and in HCWs that opted for home
      laundering (23.5% vs. 12.5%) or visited the toilet during shifts (38.1% vs.
      20.2%). Our findings indicate that HCW uniforms harbor MDRB and relevant
      interventions may reduce transmission risk. We identified LTCFs as an important
      area for targeted measures. Additional factors associated with HCW practices,
      characteristics, and attire laundering practices represent areas for improvement,
      particularly in LTCFs.

TI  - PEG-Functionalized Magnetite Nanoparticles for Modulation of Microbial Biofilms
      on Voice Prosthesis.
LID - 39 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11010039 [doi]
AB  - This study reports the fabrication of nanostructured coatings based on magnetite,
      polyethyleneglycol, and biologically active molecule (polymyxin B-PM) for
      producing biofilm-resistant surfaces (voice prosthesis). Magnetite nanoparticles 
      (MNPs) have been synthesized and functionalized using a co-precipitation method
      and were further deposited into thin coatings using the matrix-assisted pulsed
      laser evaporation (MAPLE) technique. The obtained nanoparticles and coatings were
      characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis with
      differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 
      transmission electron microscopy with selected area electron diffraction
      (TEM-SAED), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and infrared
      microscopy (IRM). Their antibiofilm activity was tested against relevant
      Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial strains. The
      Fe3O4@PEG/PM surface of modified voice prosthesis sections reduced the number of 
      CFU/mL up to four orders of magnitude in the case of S. aureus biofilm. A more
      significant inhibitory effect is noticed in the case of P. aeruginosa up to five 
      folds. These results highlight the importance of new Fe3O4@PEG/PM in the
      biomedical field.

LID - 35 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10010035 [doi]
AB  - The vancomycin-resistance associated sensor/regulator, VraSR two-component
      regulatory-system (VraSR), regulates virulence and the response of Staphylococcus
      aureus (SA) to environmental stress. To investigate the role of VraSR in SA skin 
      and soft tissue infections (SSTI), we inactivated the VraSR of a clinical CA-MRSA
      ST30 strain by insertional mutation in vraR gene using the TargeTron-Gene
      Knockout System. We constructed an organotypic keratinocyte fibroblast co-culture
      (3D-skin model) and a humanized mouse as SSTI infection models. In the 3D-skin
      model, inactivation of VraSR in the strains ST30 and USA300 showed 1-log
      reduction in adhesion and internalization (p < 0.001) compared to the respective 
      wildtype. The mutant strains of ST30 (p < 0.05) and USA300-LAC (p < 0.001) also
      exhibited reduced apoptosis. The wildtype ST30 infection in the humanized mouse
      model demonstrated increased skin lesion size and bacterial burden compared to
      BALB/c mice (p < 0.01). The response of the humanized mouse towards the MRSA
      infection exhibited human similarity indicating that the humanized mouse SSTI
      model is more suitable for evaluating the role of virulence determinants.
      Inactivation of VraSR in ST30 strain resulted in decreased skin lesion size in
      the humanized mouse SSTI model (p < 0.05) and reduction in apoptotic index (p <
      0.01) when compared with the wildtype. Our results reveal that inactivating the
      VraSR system may be a potent anti-virulence approach to control MRSA infection.

TI  - Effect of a Carotenoid Extract from Citrus reticulata By-Products on the
      Immune-Oxidative Status of Broilers.
LID - 144 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11010144 [doi]
AB  - Although carotenoids generally possess antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, 
      the in vivo synergistic action of carotenoid blends derived from plant-based
      by-products has not been thoroughly studied. Therefore, the carotenoid
      characterization and antimicrobial potential of Citrus reticulata extract as well
      as the impact of this carotenoid-rich extract (CCE) dietary supplementation on
      the performance, meat quality, and immune-oxidative status of broiler chickens
      were determined. One hundred and twenty one-day-old hatched chicks (Ross 308)
      were allocated to two dietary groups, with four replicate pens of 15 birds each. 
      Birds were fed either a basal diet (CON) or the basal diet supplemented with 0.1%
      CCE (25 mg carotenoid extract included in 1 g of soluble starch) for 42 d.
      beta-Cryptoxanthin, beta-Carotene, Zeaxanthin, and Lutein were the prevailing
      carotenoid compounds in the Citrus reticulata extract. The CCE feed additive
      exerted inhibitory properties against both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) 
      and negative (Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium)
      bacteria. Both the broiler performance and meat quality did not substantially
      differ, while the breast muscle malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration tended to
      decrease (p = 0.070) in the CCE-fed broilers. The inclusion of CCE decreased the 
      alanine aminotransferase and MDA concentration, and the activity of glutathione
      peroxidase, while the activity of superoxide dismutase was increased in the
      blood. Catalase and NADPH oxidase 2 relative transcript levels were significantly
      downregulated in the livers of the CCE-fed broilers. Additionally, Interleukin
      1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) relative transcript levels were
      downregulated in the livers of the CCE- fed broilers, while TNF and interferon
      gamma (IFNG) tended to decrease in the spleens and bursa of Fabricius,
      respectively. The present study provided new insights regarding the beneficial
      properties of carotenoids contained in Citrus reticulata in broilers'
      immune-oxidative status. These promising outcomes could be the basis for further 
      research under field conditions.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus encodes 16 two-component systems (TCSs) that enable the
      bacteria to sense and respond to changing environmental conditions. Considering
      the function of these TCSs in bacterial survival and their potential role as drug
      targets, it is important to understand the exact mechanisms underlying signal
      perception. The differences between the sensing of appropriate signals and the
      transcriptional activation of the TCS system are often not well described, and
      the signaling mechanisms are only partially understood. Here, we review present
      insights into which signals are sensed by histidine kinases in S. aureus to
      promote appropriate gene expression in response to diverse environmental
      challenges.

TI  - High-fidelity KKH variant of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 nucleases with improved
      base mismatch discrimination.
LID - gkab1291 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkab1291 [doi]
AB  - The Cas9 nuclease from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) holds great potential for
      use in gene therapy, and variants with increased fidelity have been engineered.
      However, we find that existing variants have not reached the greatest accuracy to
      discriminate base mismatches and exhibited much reduced activity when their
      mutations were grafted onto the KKH mutant of SaCas9 for editing an expanded set 
      of DNA targets. We performed structure-guided combinatorial mutagenesis to
      re-engineer KKH-SaCas9 with enhanced accuracy. We uncover that introducing a
      Y239H mutation on KKH-SaCas9's REC domain substantially reduces off-target edits 
      while retaining high on-target activity when added to a set of mutations on REC
      and RuvC domains that lessen its interactions with the target DNA strand. The
      Y239H mutation is modelled to have removed an interaction from the REC domain
      with the guide RNA backbone in the guide RNA-DNA heteroduplex structure. We
      further confirmed the greatly improved genome-wide editing accuracy and
      single-base mismatch discrimination of our engineered variants, named
      KKH-SaCas9-SAV1 and SAV2, in human cells. In addition to generating broadly
      useful KKH-SaCas9 variants with unprecedented accuracy, our findings demonstrate 
      the feasibility for multi-domain combinatorial mutagenesis on SaCas9's DNA- and
      guide RNA- interacting residues to optimize its editing fidelity.

AB  - Sixteen cassane diterpenoids (CAs), including four undescribed lactam-type, four 
      unreported lactone-type, along with eight known ones, were isolated from the
      aerial parts of Caesalpinia pulcherrima (L.) Sw. Their structures were
      characterized by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses (including NMR and
      HRESIMS). The absolute configuration of pulcherritam A was finally established by
      single-crystal X-ray diffraction with Cu Kalpha radiation. Notably, pulcherritam 
      s A-D were elucidated as a group of rare CAs bearing an alpha, beta-unsaturated
      gamma-lactam ring rather than a typical lactone moiety. Almost all compounds were
      examined for their antibacterial. The results reveal that pulcherritam H
      exhibited significant antibacterial activities against Bacillus cereus,
      Staphylococcus aureus, as well as Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidae (Psa) with
      the MIC from 6.25 to 12.5 muM, while pulcherritams A and C displayed potent
      antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA). Then, all isolates were evaluated for their anti-glioblastoma activities.
      Pulcherritam A and Pulcherrimin G illustrated moderate inhibitory activity
      against glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) U87MG cell, and the other compounds did not
      show obvious inhibitory activity against GBM U87MG cell. Furthermore, the
      preliminary structure-activity relationship and their biosynthetic pathway were
      also discussed.

AB  - Bacterial biofilms form on inert and living surfaces and display high levels of
      resistance to antibiotics, making it difficult to eradicate biofilm-related
      infections. Erdosteine, a thiol-based drug used in the treatment of acute and
      chronic respiratory diseases, has multiple pharmacodynamic properties (mucolytic,
      anti-inflammatory, antioxidant), suggesting that it may have potential in
      controlling biofilm-related infections. This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the
      effects of erdosteine in combination with different antibiotics against
      methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and
      MRSA) biofilms. Biofilm production/mass and bacterial viability were measured
      using crystal violet absorbance and resorufin resonance, respectively, in young
      (6 h) and mature (24 h) biofilms incubated with antibiotics [at concentrations
      from 0 to 200 times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)] for 24 h in the
      absence or presence of erdosteine (2, 5 and 10 mg/L). In 6-h MRSA biofilms,
      vancomycin and linezolid displayed concentration-dependent reductions in biofilm 
      mass and viability, which was enhanced in the presence of increasing
      concentrations of erdosteine. Similar results were seen for
      amoxicillin/clavulanate and levofloxacin against 6-h MSSA biofilms. Antibiotics
      alone had reduced efficacy against 24-h biofilms, while the effect of the
      erdosteine-antibiotic combination was significantly greater against 24-h biofilms
      (MRSA and MSSA). These results suggest that erdosteine enhances the activity of
      the antibiotic by facilitating its penetration into biofilms and by disrupting
      the extracellular polymeric substance matrix, which should be confirmed with
      further studies. The potential clinical value of erdosteine in treating
      biofilm-related infections warrants further investigation.

TI  - Antimicrobial, Insecticidal and Cytotoxic Activity of Linear Venom Peptides from 
      the Pseudoscorpion Chelifer cancroides.
LID - 58 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/toxins14010058 [doi]
AB  - Linear cationic venom peptides are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that exert their
      effects by damaging cell membranes. These peptides can be highly specific, and
      for some, a significant therapeutic value was proposed, in particular for
      treatment of bacterial infections. A prolific source of novel AMPs are arthropod 
      venoms, especially those of hitherto neglected groups such as pseudoscorpions. In
      this study, we describe for the first time pharmacological effects of AMPs
      discovered in pseudoscorpion venom. We examined the antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and
      insecticidal activity of full-length Checacin1, a major component of the Chelifer
      cancroides venom, and three truncated forms of this peptide. The antimicrobial
      tests revealed a potent inhibitory activity of Checacin1 against several bacteria
      and fungi, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and even 
      Gram-negative pathogens. All peptides reduced survival rates of aphids, with
      Checacin1 and the C-terminally truncated Checacin1(1-21) exhibiting effects
      comparable to Spinosad, a commercially used pesticide. Cytotoxic effects on
      mammalian cells were observed mainly for the full-length Checacin1. All tested
      peptides might be potential candidates for developing lead structures for aphid
      pest treatment. However, as these peptides were not yet tested on other insects, 
      aphid specificity has not been proven. The N- and C-terminal fragments of
      Checacin1 are less potent against aphids but exhibit no cytotoxicity on mammalian
      cells at the tested concentration of 100 microM.

TI  - Staphylococcal Enterotoxin A Induces Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction and Activates
      NLRP3 Inflammasome via NF-kappaB/MAPK Signaling Pathways in Mice.
LID - 29 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/toxins14010029 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), the toxin protein secreted by Staphylococcus 
      aureus, can cause staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks and seriously threaten 
      global public health. However, little is known about the pathogenesis of SEA in
      staphylococcal foodborne diseases. In this study, the effect of SEA on intestinal
      barrier injury and NLRP3 inflammasome activation was investigated by exposing
      BALB/c mice to SEA with increasing doses and a potential toxic mechanism was
      elucidated. Our findings suggested that SEA exposure provoked villi injury and
      suppressed the expression of ZO-1 and occludin proteins, thereby inducing
      intestinal barrier dysfunction and small intestinal injury in mice. Concurrently,
      SEA significantly up-regulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-associated
      proteins and triggered the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear
      factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways in jejunum tissues. Notably,
      selective inhibitors of MAPKs and NF-kappaB p65 ameliorated the activation of
      NLRP3 inflammasome stimulated by SEA, which further indicated that SEA could
      activate NLRP3 inflammasome through NF-kappaB/MAPK pathways. In summary, SEA was 
      first confirmed to induce intestinal barrier dysfunction and activate NLRP3
      inflammasome via NF-kappaB/MAPK signaling pathways. These findings will
      contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of SEA and
      related drug-screening for the treatment and prevention of bacteriotoxin-caused
      foodborne diseases via targeting specific pathways.

TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Snake beta-Defensins and Derived Peptides.
LID - 1 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/toxins14010001 [doi]
AB  - beta-defensins are antimicrobial peptides presenting in vertebrate animals. They 
      participate in innate immunity, but little is known about them in reptiles,
      including snakes. Although several beta-defensin genes were described in
      Brazilian snakes, their function is still unknown. The peptide sequence from
      these genes was deduced, and synthetic peptides (with approximately 40 amino
      acids and derived peptides) were tested against pathogenic bacteria and fungi
      using microbroth dilution assays. The linear peptides, derived from
      beta-defensins, were designed applying the bioisosterism strategy. The linear
      beta-defensins were more active against Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus,
      Citrobacter freundii, and Staphylococcus aureus. The derived peptides (7-14 mer) 
      showed antibacterial activity against those bacteria and on Klebsiella
      pneumoniae. Nonetheless, they did not present activity against Candida albicans, 
      Cryptococcus neoformans, Trychophyton rubrum, and Aspergillus fumigatus showing
      that the cysteine substitution to serine is deleterious to antifungal properties.
      Tryptophan residue showed to be necessary to improve antibacterial activity. Even
      though the studied snake beta-defensins do not have high antimicrobial activity, 
      they proved to be attractive as template molecules for the development of
      antibiotics.

TI  - Low-Molecular-Weight Polylysines with Excellent Antibacterial Properties and Low 
      Hemolysis.
LID - 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c01527 [doi]
AB  - The steady development of bacterial resistance has become a global public health 
      issue, and new antibacterial agents that are active against drug-resistant
      bacteria and less susceptible to bacterial resistance are urgently needed. Here, 
      a series of low-molecular-weight cationic polylysines (Cx-PLLn) with different
      hydrophobic end groups (Cx) and degrees of polymerization (PLLn) was synthesized 
      and used in antibacterial applications. All the obtained Cx-PLLn have
      antibacterial activity. Among them, C6-PLL13 displays the best antibacterial
      effect for Gram-positive bacteria, that is, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and highest selectivity
      against Gram-positive bacteria. A mechanistic study revealed that the C6-PLL13
      destroys the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and causes effective
      bacterial death. Owing to this membrane-disrupting property, C6-PLL13 showed
      rapid bacterial killing kinetics and was not likely to develop resistance after
      repeat treatment (up to 13 generations). Moreover, C6-PLL13 demonstrated a
      significant therapeutic effect on an MRSA infection mouse model, which further
      proved that this synthetic polymer could be used as an effective weapon against
      bacterial infections.

TI  - Repurposing the Antibacterial Activity of Etoposide horizontal line A
      Chemotherapeutic Drug in Combination with Eggshell-Derived Hydroxyapatite.
LID - 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c01481 [doi]
AB  - Drug repurposing has been gaining increasing interest recently due to the
      reduction in development cost and reduced development timelines. Here, we report 
      the antibacterial activity of the anticancer drug etoposide investigated in
      combination with the eggshell-derived hydroxyapatite (EHA). Hydroxyapatite (HA)
      is a well-known bioactive material with enhanced osteoconductivity and possesses 
      superior drug delivery properties. In the present work, we have synthesized
      etoposide-loaded EHA by the wet precipitation method. The physicochemical
      characterization of the samples confirmed the composition and amount of drug
      encapsulation. Screening for antibacterial activity confirmed the antibacterial
      effect of etoposide against Staphylococcus aureus. Biofilm formation test on
      pristine and etoposide-loaded samples showed the inhibition of biofilm formation 
      on etoposide loading, which was further studied by confocal laser scanning
      microscopy (CLSM) and colony forming units (CFUs). It has been found that
      etoposide-loaded HA exhibited a sustained release of the drug upto 168 h.
      Analysis of the inhibition mechanism of etoposide against S. aureus revealed
      damage to the cell membrane and has been quantified using flow cytometry by the
      uptake of propidium iodide. Etoposide-loaded eggshell-derived HA (EHA-ET)
      exhibited excellent bioactivity and cytocompatibility against mouse fibroblast
      cells (L929) and supressed the growth of osteosarcoma cells (MG-63). Our studies 
      reveal that the EHA-ET has a great potential for treating osteosarcoma and
      osteomyelitis.

TI  - Isolation and Chemical Characterization of an Alpha-Helical Peptide,
      Dendrocin-ZM1, Derived from Zataria multiflora Boiss with Potent Antibacterial
      Activity.
LID - 10.1007/s12602-022-09907-7 [doi]
AB  - Today, resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics has become a major challenge. 
      To overcome this problem, development of new drugs, besides research on their
      antibacterial activity, is essential. Among chemical components, antimicrobial
      peptides (AMPs) exhibit antibacterial activity and can be selected as suitable
      antimicrobial candidates. In this study, a novel antimicrobial peptide, called
      dendrocin-ZM1, with a molecular weight of ~3716.48 Da, was isolated from Zataria 
      multiflora Boiss (ZM) and purified via precipitation with ammonium sulfate and
      reverse-phase HPLC chromatography; it was then sequenced via Edman degradation.
      The in silico method was used to examine the physicochemical properties of
      dendrocin-ZM1. In this study, four reference strains (gram-positive and
      gram-negative) and one clinical vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain
      were used to survey the antimicrobial activities. Moreover, to examine
      cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity, a HEK-293 cell line and human red blood
      cells (RBCs) were used, respectively. Evaluation of the physicochemical
      properties of dendrocin-ZM1, as an AMP, indicated a net charge of + 7 and a
      hydrophobicity percentage of 54%. This peptide had an amphipathic alpha-helical
      conformation. It exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against the
      tested strains at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 4-16 mug/mL.
      Besides, this peptide showed negligible hemolysis and cytotoxicity in the MIC
      range. It also exhibited heat stability at temperatures of 20 to 80 degrees C and
      was active in a broad pH range (from 6.0 to 10.0). Overall, the present results
      suggested dendrocin-ZM1 as a remarkable antimicrobial candidate.

TI  - Taxonomic and Metabolite Diversities of Moss-Associated Actinobacteria from
      Thailand.
LID - 22 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12010022 [doi]
AB  - Actinobacteria are a group of ecologically important bacteria capable of
      producing diverse bioactive compounds. However, much remains unknown about the
      taxonomic and metabolic diversities of actinobacteria from many geographic
      regions and ecological niches. In this study, we report the isolation of
      actinobacteria from moss and moss-associated rhizosphere soils in Thailand. Among
      the 89 isolates analyzed for their bioactivities, 86 strains produced
      indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, ranging from 0.04 to 59.12 mg/L); 42 strains produced 
      hydroxamate type of siderophore; 35 strains produced catecholate type of
      siderophore; 21 strains solubilized tricalcium phosphate; and many strains
      exhibited antagonistic activities against one to several of the seven selected
      plant, animal, and human pathogens. Overall, actinobacteria from the rhizosphere 
      soil of mosses showed greater abilities to produce IAA and siderophores and to
      solubilize tricalcium phosphate than those from mosses. Among these 89 isolates, 
      37 were analyzed for their 16S rRNA gene sequences, which revealed their diverse 
      phylogenetic distributions among seven genera, Streptomyces, Micromonospora,
      Nocardia, Actinoplanes, Saccharothrix, Streptosporangium, and Cryptosporangium.
      Furthermore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses of ethyl acetate crude
      extracts of three selected isolates with inhibitory effects against a
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain revealed diverse metabolites
      with known antimicrobial activities. Together, our results demonstrate that
      actinobacteria from mosses in Thailand are taxonomically diverse and capable of
      producing a range of metabolites with plant-growth-promoting and microbial
      pathogen-inhibiting potentials.

AB  - Three new tripeptide derivatives asterripeptides A-C (1-3) were isolated from
      Vietnamese mangrove-derived fungus Aspergillus terreus LM.5.2. Structures of
      isolated compounds were determined by a combination of NMR and ESIMS techniques. 
      The absolute configurations of all stereocenters were determined using the
      Murfey's method. The isolated compounds 1-3 contain a rare fungi cinnamic acid
      residue. The cytotoxicity of isolated compounds against several cancer cell lines
      and inhibition ability of sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus of asterripeptides
      A-C were investigated.

      growth of the blue economy. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of
      seasonal growth (from May to September) on the in vitro antioxidant (FRAP, DPPH, 
      and ORAC) and antimicrobial effects (MIC and MBC) of Cystoseira compressa
      collected in the Central Adriatic Sea. Algal compounds were analyzed by
      UPLC-PDA-ESI-QTOF, and TPC and TTC were determined. Fatty acids, among which
      oleic acid, palmitoleic acid, and palmitic acid were the dominant compounds in
      samples. The highest TPC, TTC and FRAP were obtained for June extract, 83.4 +/-
      4.0 mg GAE/g, 8.8 +/- 0.8 mg CE/g and 2.7 +/- 0.1 mM TE, respectively. The
      highest ORAC value of 72.1 +/- 1.2 microM TE was obtained for the August samples,
      and all samples showed extremely high free radical scavenging activity and DPPH
      inhibition (>80%). The MIC and MBC results showed the best antibacterial activity
      for the June, July and August samples, when sea temperature was the highest,
      against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella
      enteritidis. The results show C. compressa as a potential species for the
      industrial production of nutraceuticals or functional food ingredients.

AB  - Analysis of the chemical components from the culture broth of the marine
      bacterium Saccharomonospora sp. CNQ-490 has yielded three novel compounds:
      saccharobisindole (1), neoasterric methyl ester (2), and 7-chloro-4(1H)-quinolone
      (3), in addition to acremonidine E (4), pinselin (5), penicitrinon A (6), and
      penicitrinon E (7). The chemical structures of the three novel compounds were
      elucidated by the interpretation of 1D, 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and 
      high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data. Compound 2 generated weak
      inhibition activity against Bacillus subtilis KCTC2441 and Staphylococcus aureus 
      KCTC1927 at concentrations of 32 mug/mL and 64 mug/mL, respectively, whereas
      compounds 1 and 3 did not have any observable effects. In addition, compound 2
      displayed weak anti-quorum sensing (QS) effects against S. aureus KCTC1927 and
      Micrococcus luteus SCO560.

TI  - Characterization of Bioactivities and Biosynthesis of Angucycline/Angucyclinone
      Derivatives Derived from Gephyromycinifex aptenodytis gen. nov., sp. nov.
LID - 34 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/md20010034 [doi]
AB  - Strain NJES-13(T) is the type strain and currently the only species of the newly 
      established actinobacteria genera Aptenodytes in the family Dermatophilaceae
      isolated from the gut microbiota of the Antarctic emperor penguin. This strain
      demonstrated excellent bioflocculation activity with bacteria-derived
      exopolysaccharides (EPSs). Moreover, it produced bioactive
      angucycline/angucyclinone derivatives (ADs) and contained one type III polyketide
      synthase (T3PKS), thus demonstrating great potential to produce novel bioactive
      compounds. However, the low productivity of the potential new AD metabolite was
      the main obstacle for its chemical structure elucidation. In this study, to
      increase the concentration of targeted metabolites, the influence of cellular
      morphology on AD metabolism in strain NJES-13(T) was determined using glass
      bead-enhanced fermentation. Based on the cellular ultra-structural observation
      driven by bacterial EPSs, and quantitative analysis of the targeted metabolites, 
      the successful increasing of the productivity of three AD metabolites was
      achieved. Afterward, a new frigocyclinone analogue was isolated and then
      identified as 2-hydroxy-frigocyclinone, as well as two other known ADs named
      2-hydroxy-tetrangomycin (2-HT) and gephyromycin (GPM). Three AD metabolites were 
      found to demonstrate different bioactivities. Both C-2 hydroxyl substitutes,
      2-hydroxy-tetrangomycin and 2-hydroxy-frigocyclinone, exhibited variable
      inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and
      Candida albicans. Moreover, the newly identified 2-hydroxy-frigocyclinone also
      showed significant cytotoxicity against three tested human-derived cancerous cell
      lines (HL-60, Bel-7402 and A549), with all obtained IC50 values less than 10
      microM. Based on the genetic analysis after genomic mining, the plausible
      biogenetic pathway of the three bioactive ADs in strain NJES-13(T) was also
      proposed.

TI  - Fast Gelation of Poly(ionic liquid)-Based Injectable Antibacterial Hydrogels.
LID - 52 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/gels8010052 [doi]
AB  - Traditional antibacterial hydrogels have a broad-spectrum bactericidal effect and
      are widely used as wound dressings. However, the biological toxicity and drug
      resistance of these antibacterial hydrogels cannot meet the requirements of
      long-term clinical application. Imidazolium poly(ionic liquids) (PILs) are
      polymeric antibacterial agents exhibiting strong antibacterial properties, as
      they contain a strong positive charge. In this study, two imidazolium PILs,
      namely poly(N-butylimidazolium propiolic acid sodium) (PBP) and
      poly(N-(3,6-dioxaoctane) imidazolium propiolic acid sodium) (PDP), as high
      efficiency antibacterial agents, were synthesized by polycondensation reaction.
      Then, the PILs were compounded with polyethylene glycol (PEG) by a thiol-yne
      click reaction to prepare injectable antibacterial hydrogels. An in vitro assay
      showed that the injectable antibacterial hydrogels could not only quickly kill
      Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), but also had
      low toxicity for human skin fibroblasts cells (HSFs) and human umbilical vein
      endothelial cells (HUVECs), respectively. Additionally, the lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS) inflammation model revealed that the injectable antibacterial hydrogels
      also had anti-inflammatory effects, which would be advantageous to accelerate
      wound healing.

AB  - The aim of this study was the synthesis of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) by using
      Stachys schtschegleevii extract and checking the composition, morphology and size
      of the green synthesized AgNPs using the analytical techniques (UV-vis, DLS, zeta
      potential, SEM-EDX, FT-IR and TEM). The TEM images of AgNPs represent a smooth
      surface and are spherical in shape with an average particle size of 31.43 nm. The
      antioxidant activities of green synthesized AgNPs were appraised by radical
      scavenging 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl test and the green synthesized AgNPs
      showed a strong ability to scavenge free radicals. In addition, AgNPs displayed a
      remarkable antibacterial and antifungal activity against various microorganisms. 
      We employed molecular docking to investigate the AgNPs interaction with
      Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and
      Candida albicans and there is a good agreement between molecular docking and our 
      experimental results. The result of ct-DNA-AgNPs interaction demonstrated that
      AgNPs can bind to ct-DNA through partial intercalation binding mode.Communicated

AB  - Organ transplantations have an increasing medical relevance. It is becoming a
      regular procedure with an increase in individuals waiting for organs. The
      increase in the number of discarded organs is mostly due to the donor bacterial
      and/or viral infection. In this article, we are demonstrating the feasibility of 
      reduction of the bacterial load in kidney model by using ultraviolet-C as a
      germicidal agent in circulating liquids. Using Staphylococcus aureus as a
      bacteria model, we were able to demonstrate that in less than 30 min of liquid
      circulation and associated to irradiation, the bacterial load of the perfusate
      Custodiol HTK, histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (solution with 5 log CFU mL(-1)
      ), was fully eliminated. A modeling approach was created to verify the
      possibility of bacterial load decrease, when an organ (here, a renal experimental
      model) is present in the circuit, releasing a varied rate of microorganisms over 
      time, while the solution is irradiated. Finally, we use an ex vivo model with
      swine kidney, circulating in the preservation solution with a Lifeport Kidney
      Transporter machine, to demonstrate that we can contaminate the organ and then
      promote the elimination of the microbiological load. The results show the
      feasibility of the technique.

PG  - e2100468

AB  - The chemical compositions of 15 saffron samples from 11 countries (Morocco,
      India, Italy, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Iran, Lithuania, Ukraine, Australia,
      and Azerbaijan) were evaluated. The samples were analyzed regarding the impact of
      environmental factors on the composition of apocarotenoids and phenolic
      constituents. Quantification of saffron metabolites was carried out using
      high-performance liquid chromatography. It was found that the high content of
      chlorogenic acid (0.2 mg/g, Ukraine) and ferulic acid (0.28 mg/g, India) was
      controlled by the duration of solar radiation during plant development. The
      accumulation of caffeic acid (the higher content 4.88 mg/g, Ukraine) in stigmas
      depended on the average air temperature. In contrast, the total crocins content
      according to the correlation analysis depended on the duration of solar
      radiation, the solar UV index, and the soil type. Rutin was found in all samples 
      (0.83-8.74 mg/g). The highest amount of crocins (average 382.45 mg/g) accumulated
      in saffron from Italy and Ukraine. Crocins, picrocrocin, safranal, and rutin can 
      further serve as saffron quality markers. All validation parameters were
      satisfactory and high-performance liquid chromatography methods could be
      successfully applied for the composition assessment of saffron metabolites.
      Saffron extracts showed the highest antibacterial activity against Bacillus
      subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli (MICs 62.5-125 microg/ml).

TI  - Global epidemiology of childhood bone and joint infection: a systematic review.
LID - 10.1007/s15010-021-01741-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Childhood bone and joint infection (BJI) is a potentially severe disease
      that may have permanent sequelae, including growth impairment and limb deformity.
      It has been characterised in the literature with a focus on Western epidemiology;
      there are currently no reports detailing global epidemiology and bacteriology.
      This omits key data from determining temporal trends, appropriate antibiotic
      therapy, and resource allocation. This review aims to identify studies that
      characterise the incidence of childhood bone and joint infection or provide
      detailed bacteriology within their region. METHODS: A systematic review of the
      literature was performed from 01/01/1980 to 31/12/2020. Data has been analysed to
      give incidence of disease per 100,000 children, primary pathogen by country where
      available, and risk ratio (RR) for disease by ethnicity. This is applicable for
      areas that experience race-related inequitable burden of disease. RESULTS:
      Forty-four articles met the inclusion area; of these, seven were population-wide 
      studies, primarily from Europe or the United States, and the remainder were
      cohort studies. Incidence could be derived from 26 studies compromising over 34, 
      000 children. Information on bacteriology was available from 39 publications (10,
      957 cases). Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus is the most common
      pathogen in the West. Recently, disease secondary to Kingella kingae and
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus has increased. Salmonella remains a dominant
      pathogen in African regions. Increased risk of disease is observed in Aboriginal,
      New Zealand Maori, Pacific, Indigenous Fijian, and Bedouin children. CONCLUSION: 
      The current state of the literature detailing incidence of childhood BJI focuses 
      on disease patterns from the West. There is a paucity of high-quality
      publications in the developing world. Despite these limitations, global trends in
      burden of disease show race-related inequitable risk of BJI. Temporal and
      regional variation in bacteriology can be demonstrated. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

TI  - 2-Sulfonylpyrimidines as Privileged Warheads for the Development of S. aureus
      Sortase A Inhibitors.
PG  - 804970
LID - 10.3389/fmolb.2021.804970 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most frequent causes of nosocomial and
      community-acquired infections, with emerging multiresistant isolates causing a
      significant burden to public health systems. We identified 2-sulfonylpyrimidines 
      as a new class of potent inhibitors against S. aureus sortase A acting by
      covalent modification of the active site cysteine 184. Series of derivatives were
      synthesized to derive structure-activity relationship (SAR) with the most potent 
      compounds displaying low micromolar KI values. Studies on the inhibition
      selectivity of homologous cysteine proteases showed that 2-sulfonylpyrimidines
      reacted efficiently with protonated cysteine residues as found in sortase A,
      though surprisingly, no reaction occurred with the more nucleophilic cysteine
      residue from imidazolinium-thiolate dyads of cathepsin-like proteases. By means
      of enzymatic and chemical kinetics as well as quantum chemical calculations, it
      could be rationalized that the S N Ar reaction between protonated cysteine
      residues and 2-sulfonylpyrimidines proceeds in a concerted fashion, and the
      mechanism involves a ternary transition state with a conjugated base. Molecular
      docking and enzyme inhibition at variable pH values allowed us to hypothesize
      that in sortase A this base is represented by the catalytic histidine 120, which 
      could be substantiated by QM model calculation with 4-methylimidazole as
      histidine analog.

AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) infection and neoplasm occur most often
      independently. Their concomitant presentation has been noted across different CNS
      tumours but is considered a rare entity. The phenomenon is mostly seen in
      relation to direct seeding of infection via frontal air sinuses. Here, we present
      an unusual case of an occipital meningioma associated with intraparenchymal
      paratumoural abscess formation. It is also the second documented to culture
      methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. We then review and surmise the
      relevant literature of meningioma-associated abscess. We discuss the clinical
      presentations, aetiology, suspected pathogenesis, management and outcomes
      reported.

TI  - The Inhibition Effect of Linezolid With Reyanning Mixture on MRSA and its Biofilm
      is More Significant than That of Linezolid Alone.
PG  - 766309
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2021.766309 [doi]
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a superbacterium, and when 
      it forms biofilms, it is difficult to treat even with the first-line of
      antibiotic linezolid (LNZ). Reyanning mixture (RYN), a compound-based Chinese
      medicine formula, has been found to have inhibitory effects on biofilms. This
      study aims to explore the synergistic inhibitory effect and corresponding
      mechanisms of their (LNZ&RYN) combination on the planktonic as well as biofilm
      cells of MRSA. Broth microdilution and chessboard methods were employed for the
      determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and synergistic
      concentration of LNZ&RYN, respectively. The effect of the combined medication on 
      biofilm and mature biofilm of MRSA were observed by biofilm morphology and
      permeability experiments, respectively. To unveil the molecular mechanism of
      action of the synergistic combination of LNZ and RYN, RT-PCR based
      biofilm-related gene expression analysis and ultra-high pressure liquid
      chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry based endogenous metabonomic
      analysis were deployed. The results indicated that 1/16RYN as the best combined
      dose reduced LNZ (4 mug/ml) to 2 mug/ml. The combined treatment inhibited living 
      MRSA before and after biofilm formation, removed the residual structure of dead
      bacteria in MRSA biofilms and affected the shape and size of bacteria, resulting 
      in the improvement of biofilm permeability. The mechanism was that
      biofilm-related genes such as agrC, atlA, and sarA, as well as amino acid uptake 
      associated with the metabolism of 3-dehydrocarnitine, kynurenine, L-leucine,
      L-lysine and sebacic acid were inhibited. This study provides evidence for the
      treatment of MRSA and its biofilms with LNZ combined with RYN.

AB  - As a heterogeneous and wide inflammation, osteoarticular infection (OAI) shows an
      increasing incidence in recent years. Staphylococcus aureus is the most important
      pathogen causing OAI. The antibiotic treatment will affect the outcomes of OAI
      patients, and the drug selection and dosage regimen highly rely on patients'
      variability, pathogen susceptibility, and drug property like bone permeability.
      Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) provides options to describe and quantify 
      the pharmacokinetic (PK) variability of the OAI population using different
      models, such as the population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model and
      physiological-based pharmacokinetic (PB/PK) model. In the present review, we
      highlighted that the MIPD of antibiotics played a critical role in OAI and listed
      the dose regimen recommended by the model. Collectively, our current study
      provided a valuable reference for the treatment of patients and improved the
      safety and efficiency of drug use.

TI  - Differential microbiological spectrum and resistance pattern in periprosthetic
      hip joint infections: a matched-cohort analysis comparing direct anterior versus 
      lateral approach.
PG  - 72
LID - 10.1186/s12891-022-05037-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, total hip arthroplasty via the direct anterior
      approach (DAA) has become more common. Little is known on the influence of the
      surgical approach on the microbiological spectrum and resistance pattern in
      periprosthetic hip joint infections. The aim of the present study was to evaluate
      the microbiological spectrum and resistance pattern in periprosthetic hip joint
      infections comparing the direct anterior versus lateral approach in a
      matched-cohort analysis at a single institution. METHODS: Patients who underwent 
      revision hip arthroplasty due to PJI following primary total hip arthroplasty
      with culture positive microbiology were analyzed. In all study patients, both the
      primary surgery and the revisions surgery were performed at the same institution.
      Only patients in whom primary surgery was performed via a direct anterior or
      lateral approach were included (n = 87). A matched cohort analysis was performed 
      to compare the microbiological spectrum and resistance pattern in PJI following
      direct anterior (n = 36) versus lateral (n = 36) primary THA. RESULTS: We
      identified both a significantly different microbiological spectrum and resistance
      pattern in PJI comparing direct anterior versus lateral approach THA.
      Cutibacterium avidum was obtained more frequently in the anterior subgroup (22.2%
      vs. 2.8%, p = 0.028). In the subgroup of infections with Staphylococcus aureus (n
      = 12), methicillin resistance was detected in 3/5 cases in the direct anterior
      group versus 0/7 cases in the lateral group (p = 0.045). Overall, Staphylococcus 
      epidermidis was the most common causative microorganism in both groups (direct
      anterior: 36.1%; lateral: 27.8%, p = 0.448). CONCLUSION: The present study
      indicates a potential influence of the localization of the skin incision in THA
      on the microbiological spectrum and resistance pattern in PJI. Cutibacterium
      avidum seemed to be a more common causative microorganism in PJI in patients who 
      underwent direct anterior compared to lateral approach THA.

TI  - Fingerprints of Element Concentrations in Infective Endocarditis Obtained by Mass
      Spectrometric Imaging and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding.
PG  - 360-372
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.1c00485 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus-induced infective endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening
      disease. Differences in virulence between distinct S. aureus strains, which are
      partly based on the molecular mechanisms during bacterial adhesion, are not fully
      understood. Yet, distinct molecular or elemental patterns, occurring during
      specific steps in the adhesion process, may help to identify novel targets for
      accelerated diagnosis or improved treatment. Here, we use laser ablation
      inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) of post-mortem tissue
      slices of an established mouse model of IE to obtain fingerprints of element
      distributions in infected aortic valve tissue. Three S. aureus strains with
      different virulence due to deficiency in distinct adhesion molecules
      (fibronectin-binding protein A and staphylococcal protein A) were used to assess 
      strain-specific patterns. Data analysis was performed by t-distributed stochastic
      neighbor embedding (t-SNE) of mass spectrometry imaging data, using manual
      reference tissue classification in histological specimens. This procedure allowed
      for obtaining distinct element patterns in infected tissue for all three
      bacterial strains and for comparing those to patterns observed in healthy mice or
      after sterile inflammation of the valve. In tissue from infected mice, increased 
      concentrations of calcium, zinc, and magnesium were observed compared to
      noninfected mice. Between S. aureus strains, pronounced variations were observed 
      for manganese. The presented approach is sensitive for detection of S. aureus
      infection. For strain-specific tissue characterization, however, further
      improvements such as establishing a database with elemental fingerprints may be
      required.

TI  - Association of Staphylococcus aureus in platelet concentrates with skin diseases 
      in blood donors: Limitations of cultural bacterial screening.
LID - 10.1111/trf.16804 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates (PCs) is a major
      problem in transfusion medicine. Contamination with Staphylococcus aureus is
      occasionally missed, even with cultural screening. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:
      Donors implicated in S. aureus-contaminated PC were followed up. Skin and nasal
      swab specimens from six donors and S. aureus isolated from PCs related to these
      donors were subjected to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis (PFGE) to determine the identity of bacteria. To evaluate the
      validity of the screening method using BacT/ALERT 3D, we spiked S. aureus and
      three other bacterial species as comparisons into PCs and investigated their
      growth pattern. RESULTS: S. aureus was isolated from all nasal specimens and from
      the arm skin specimens of three donors with atopic dermatitis. In all cases, the 
      S. aureus strains isolated from the PC and those from the nasal and skin
      specimens of the same donor showed concordant results using MLST and PFGE. In the
      spiking study, S. aureus showed irregular detectability over 24 to 48 h
      post-spike periods, whereas the three other bacterial species were detected in
      all culture bottles after a 24-h post-spike period. DISCUSSION: The strain
      identity of S. aureus between donor and PC suggests that the contaminants were
      derived from those colonized in the donor. Furthermore, S. aureus yielded
      false-negative results using BacT/ALERT 3D.

      on MRSA biofilm formation.
LID - dkab497 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jac/dkab497 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial biofilm is a key component in the pathogenesis of
      prosthetic joint infection (PJI). Synovial fluid has been shown to have
      inhibitory activity against planktonic bacteria. However, the contribution of
      synovial fluid in prevention of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) planktonic
      and biofilm forms is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To test the antibacterial and
      antibiofilm activities of synovial fluid, including that containing cefazolin,
      against MSSA and MRSA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the antiplanktonic
      and antibiofilm activities of synovial fluid collected from patients given
      preoperative cefazolin while undergoing elective arthroplasty surgery. MICs of
      cefazolin were determined for planktonic and biofilm cultures of biofilm-forming 
      strains of MSSA and MRSA. RESULTS: Synovial fluid inhibited planktonic and
      biofilm cultures of MSSA and MRSA. Cefazolin-containing synovial fluid had
      greater antibacterial and antibiofilm activities than the same cefazolin
      concentration in glucose LB (GLB) broth. MSSA and MRSA MICs of cefazolin
      suspended in synovial fluid were 0.7 mg/L. The MICs of cefazolin diluted in GLB
      broth were higher, measuring 1.4 mg/L for MSSA and 23 mg/L for MRSA. CONCLUSIONS:
      Synovial fluid containing cefazolin inhibited biofilm- and planktonic-state MRSA 
      cultures. This may explain the apparent effect of cefazolin in the prevention of 
      MRSA PJI.

TI  - Bacteriological Investigation and Drug Resistance Analysis of Chronic Refractory 
      Wound Secretions: A Clinical Study.
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0000000000008473 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic refractory wounds were common and the treatments were
      complicated for burn and plastic surgeons. This study was to investigate the
      bacterial distribution characteristics and bacterial drug resistance of chronic
      refractory wound secretions. METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed 425
      patients with chronic refractory wound infection. The results of bacterial
      culture of wound secretions and drug sensitivity test were retrospectively
      analyzed. Further, the location area of the wound was divided into 4 regions, and
      the difference of the bacterial culture results between different regions was
      analyzed. RESULTS: The wound secretions were cultured into 401 bacterial strains,
      including 206 gram-positive bacteria strains, accounting for 51.4%, with the
      highest detection rate of Staphylococcus aureus at 26.2% (105/401). There were
      195 gram-negative bacteria strains, accounting for 48.6%, with the highest
      detection rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 14.2% (57/401). There were 6 fungal
      strains. The proportion of gram-negative bacteria in the III region of the wound 
      zone was significantly greater than that in the other 3 regions. CONCLUSIONS: The
      detection rate of gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria of chronic
      refractory wound secretions is not much different. However, in the area close to 
      the perineum (III region), gram-negative bacteria is significantly higher, which 
      has a certain reference value for the use of antibiotics in clinical
      practice.Level of evidence: Level 4.

TI  - Bacteremia in patients with liver cirrhosis in the era of increasing
      antimicrobial resistance: single-center epidemiology.
PG  - 1883-1890
LID - 10.3855/jidc.14508 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Liver cirrhosis is commonly associated with bacterial infections,
      which contribute to unfavorable outcome. This study aimed to investigate the
      epidemiology of bacteremia and patterns of antibiotic resistance in patients with
      cirrhosis, factors associated with multidrug-resistant infection, and predictors 
      of mortality. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective single-center study included
      patients with cirrhosis treated between January 2016 and December 2018. Data were
      collected from the patients' medical records. The severity of liver disease was
      determined using the Child-Pugh, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Na, Chronic
      Liver Failure-Consortium Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure, and Chronic Liver
      Failure-Consortium Acute Decompensation scores. RESULTS: A total of 85 patients
      with cirrhosis and bacteremia were included (male: 82.4%, mean age 60.3 +/- 9.4
      years). The etiology of cirrhosis was mainly alcoholism (87.1%). After 30 days,
      lethal outcome occurred in 44.7% of the patients. The most commonly isolated
      pathogens were Enterococcus spp. (31.8%), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
      aureus (15.3%), and Escherichia coli (14.1%), while 37.3% of all isolated
      microorganisms were multi-drug resistant. Multi-drug resistant infection [odds
      ratio (OR): 6.198, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.326-17.540, p = 0.006] and
      neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR = 1.181, 95% CI = 1.043-1.337, p = 0.009) are 
      independent predictors of mortality. The aforementioned scores, which represent
      the extent of hepatic insufficiency, are significantly higher in patients with
      multi-drug resistant isolates, while multi-drug resistant bacteremia was more
      common in patients with more advanced liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-drug
      resistant bacteremia is more common in patients in whom liver disease is more
      severe and is a major independent predictor of mortality.

      Staphylococcus aureus in Caenorhabditis elegans.
PG  - 1868-1875
LID - 10.3855/jidc.13664 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) gene silencing is a
      promising therapeutic option as it does not impose selective pressure on bacteria
      that is often associated with the development of resistance. The study assessed
      the effect of siRNA targeted to sarA and agrA in S. aureus and the relationship
      between the transcriptional response, biofilm formation and pathogenicity.
      METHODOLOGY: siRNAs designed against agrA and sarA were electroporated into
      methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains. mRNA levels,
      growth kinetics, biofilm formation and minimal inhibitory concentration were
      measured. Efficacy of siRNA in bacteria was assessed using survival assays in a
      C. elegans model. Differences in gene expression before and after siRNA treatment
      were anaysed using the paired t-test, while the log rank test was used to assess 
      the significance of any difference among survival rates of nematodes. RESULTS:
      Biofilm formation decreased significantly in siRNA treated strains and growth
      rates of siRNA treated strains were significantly higher compared to untreated
      strains. We observed significant decreases in the transcriptional response in
      siRNA treated strains, with concomitant significant increases in the lifespan of 
      C. elegans worms exposed to siRNA-treated versus untreated strains. CONCLUSIONS: 
      siRNA targeted to agrA and sarA lowered mRNA transcription and pathogenicity of
      S. aureus.

      Taif social correctional center, Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 1861-1867
LID - 10.3855/jidc.14999 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Community-acquired methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus 
      aureus are primarily distinguished through their genetic characteristics. These
      strains carry the smaller types of staphylococcal cassette chromosome,
      specifically types IV and V. These infections occur mostly in healthy younger
      patients, and have been linked to such severe clinical conditions as necrotizing 
      pneumonia and sepsis. A higher risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus contagion exists among incarcerated sub-populations; therefore, this study
      investigated colonization rate and risk factors among the residents of the Taif
      Social Correctional Center. METHODOLOGY: The study included 93 inmates and 19
      employees. Specimens were collected from participants' noses and hands and from
      different environmental locations. The isolated organisms were identified
      according to standard microbiological methods. Methicillin resistance was
      evaluated using the standard cefoxitin disk diffusion method and oxacillin screen
      agar procedure. Methicillin resistance was further confirmed by multiplex
      polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: High methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus colonization rate was found among the center residents (24.7%) and
      employees (15.8%). Long duration of residence in the correctional institution and
      bad hand hygiene emerged as prominent risk factors for this colonization. An
      antibiogram categorized the isolated strains into six phenotypes, with a
      predominance of two antibiotic-resistant patterns suggesting cross-contamination 
      and the presence of local foci of dissemination. CONCLUSIONS: Taif Social
      Correctional Center residents exhibited a higher prevalence of
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization than was found in
      similar institutions. Poor personal hygiene and infection control measures are
      likely the major contributors to the problem.

      characterization of clonal types and antibiotic susceptibility.
PG  - 1854-1860
LID - 10.3855/jidc.14963 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The assessment of the clonal spread of methicillin resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in nosocomial and community-acquired infections
      through characterization of the isolates is critical for tracking the evolution
      of the epidemics, implementing effective control measures, and preventing future 
      outbreaks of MRSA. In this context, it is aimed with this study to determine the 
      clonal relationships between the S. aureus isolates obtained from the patients
      receiving treatment in the intensive-care units of a state hospital in Turkey.
      METHODOLOGY: A total of 80 MRSA isolates obtained from the patients receiving
      treatment in three different intensive-care units were analyzed for their
      antibiotic susceptibilities, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles, and
      multilocus sequence types. RESULTS: The dendrogram of the pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis profiles revealed two major pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
      pulsotypes: A and B, which were further divided into two (A1 and A2) and four
      (B1-B4) subgroups, respectively. Multilocus sequence typeanalysis indicated that 
      all isolates belonged to a single MRSA clone, sequence type 239. No significant
      difference was found between the antibiotic sensitivity profiles of strains
      isolated from different intensive-care units. All of the strains were sensitive
      to linezolid and vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that the MRSA strains 
      isolated from the patients receiving treatment at the intensive-care units of the
      hospital constituted two major pulse-field types and belonged to the ST239
      lineage, one of the most extensively distributed MRSA lineages throughout the
      world.

AB  - New insoluble layered zirconium phosphate carboxyaminophosphonates (ZPs), with
      the general formula Zr2(PO4)H5[(O3PCH2)2N(CH2)nCOO]2.mH2O (n = 3, 4, and 5), have
      been prepared and characterized. The crystal structure for n = 3 and 4 samples
      was determined ab initio from X-ray powder diffraction data. The structure for n 
      = 3 was monoclinic in space group C2/c with the following unit cell parameters: a
      = 34.346(1) A, b = 8.4930(2) A, c = 9.0401(2) A, and beta = 97.15(1) degrees .
      The structure for n = 4 was triclinic in space group P1 with the following unit
      cell parameters: a = 17.9803(9) A, b = 8.6066(4) A, c = 9.0478(3) A, alpha =
      90.466(3) degrees , beta = 94.910(4) degrees , and gamma = 99.552(4) degrees .
      The two structures had the same connectivity as Zr phosphate glycine
      diphosphonate (n = 1), as previously reported. By intercalation of short amines, 
      these layered compounds were exfoliated in single lamella or packets of a few
      lamellae, which formed colloidal dispersions in water. After a thorough
      characterization, the dispersed lamellae were functionalized with Ag
      nanoparticles, which were grown in situ on the surface of exfoliated lamellae.
      Finally, their antimicrobial activity was tested on several Gram-positive and
      Gram-negative bacteria. All of these systems were found to be active against the 
      four pathogens most frequently isolated from orthopedic prosthetic infections and
      often causative of nosocomial infections. Interestingly, they were found to
      express powerful inhibitory activity even against bacterial strains exhibiting a 
      relevant profile of antibiotic resistance such as Staphylococcus aureus ATCC
      700699.

TI  - Piezo-Augmented Sonosensitizer with Strong Ultrasound-Propelling Ability for
      Efficient Treatment of Osteomyelitis.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.1c09189 [doi]
AB  - The successful treatment of osteomyelitis remains a great challenge in the field 
      of orthopedics. The clinical method for treating refractory bone infection
      requires a combination therapy of long-term systemic antibiotics administration
      and surgical debridement. It is highly desirable to develop an antibiotic-free,
      noninvasive, rapid strategy to eradicate osteomyelitis. Herein, we fabricate a
      piezoelectric-enhanced sonosensitizer that consists of a porphyrin-based hollow
      metal-organic framework (HNTM), MoS2 nanosheets, and a red cell (RBC) membrane.
      We find that the ultrasound (US)-induced piezoelectric polarization of MoS2 can
      improve the charge transfer of HNTM at the heterointerface of HNTM-MoS2,
      increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Besides, MoS2
      increases the asymmetric shape of HNTM, leading to the strong US-propelling
      ability of HNTM-MoS2. The produced ROS and strong mechanical force can kill
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with an antibacterial
      efficiency of 98.5% under 15 min of US treatment, resulting in intracellular DNA 
      damage and increased oxidative stress and disturbance of purine metabolism,
      tryptophan metabolism, and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis of MRSA. Together
      with the toxin neutralization ability, the RBC-HNTM-MoS2 successfully eliminates 
      the bone infection and suppresses inflammation and bone loss. This work provides 
      another strategy for developing an efficient sonosensitizer through
      piezoelectric-assisted sonocatalysis and enhancing US-propelling ability.

LID - 10.7554/eLife.66376 [doi]
LID - e66376 [pii]
AB  - The pandemic of antibiotic resistance represents a major human health threat
      demanding new antimicrobial strategies. Multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF)
      is the synthase and flippase of the phospholipid lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol that 
      increases virulence and resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA) and other pathogens to cationic host defense peptides and antibiotics.
      With the aim to design MprF inhibitors that could sensitize MRSA to antimicrobial
      agents and support the clearance of staphylococcal infections with minimal
      selection pressure, we developed MprF-targeting monoclonal antibodies, which
      bound and blocked the MprF flippase subunit. Antibody M-C7.1 targeted a specific 
      loop in the flippase domain that proved to be exposed at both sides of the
      bacterial membrane, thereby enhancing the mechanistic understanding of bacterial 
      lipid translocation. M-C7.1 rendered MRSA susceptible to host antimicrobial
      peptides and antibiotics such as daptomycin, and it impaired MRSA survival in
      human phagocytes. Thus, MprF inhibitors are recommended for new antivirulence
      approaches against MRSA and other bacterial pathogens.

TI  - Identification of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ST8 isolates in
      China with potential high virulence.
PG  - 507-518
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2022.2031310 [doi]
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST8 strains have spread
      worldwide, causing outbreaks in various regions. However, this clone has only
      been sporadically reported in China. Consequently, detailed information regarding
      the phylogeny and potential virulence of S. aureus ST8 strains in China remains
      unknown. In this study, we characterized six ST8 strains collected from three
      tertiary hospitals in China, including three MRSA (MR50, MR526, and MR254) and
      three MSSA (H78, H849 and H863). Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic
      analysis showed that the six strains formed two separate clusters, including two 
      (MR50 and MR526) and four (MR254, H78, H849 and H863) isolates, respectively.
      Among them, MR50 and MR526 harboured spa t008, SCCmec IVa, arginine catabolic
      mobile element, and were phylogenetically close to the epidemic USA300 strains,
      while other four strains belonged to spa t9101 and formed a unique branch. MR254 
      carried a novel hybrid SCCmec element (namely SCCmec254). Same as the USA300
      prototype strain LAC, the China S. aureus ST8 strains produced weak biofilms
      except MR254. Among them, MR254 had significantly stronger haemolysis ability and
      higher alpha-toxin levels than others, while MR526 showed comparable haemolysis
      and alpha-toxin production levels as USA300-LAC. In mouse skin abscess model,
      MR254 showed particularly strong invasions, accompanied by necrosis, while MR526 
      exhibited similar infection levels as USA300-LAC. These data suggested that the
      China MRSA ST8 isolates (e.g. MR254 and MR526) were highly virulent, displaying
      higher or similar virulence potential as the epidemic USA300 strain. Active
      surveillance should be enacted to closely monitor the further spread of these
      hyper-virulent MRSA strains in China.

AB  - In this study, the chitosan, a polysaccharide, was encapsulated with the bee
      pollen and the apple cider vinegar. The freeze-drying method was used in the
      encapsulation process. The freeze cooling temperature was determined as -80
      degrees C. The obtained encapsulated chitosan compounds were analyzed by Fourier 
      Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and their molecular weights were
      determined by the cryoscopy method. The total amount of the phenol compounds and 
      % the antioxidant activity of the synthesized compounds were measured by UV
      spectrophotometer and, the loading capacity of the polyphenol compounds in
      encapsulation was determined. The success of encapsulation was calculated based
      on the % encapsulation efficiency (%EE) calculation. The antibacterial and the
      surface activity properties of the obtained CSx and CSy compounds were analyzed
      against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Salmonella
      bacteria using the well diffusion method and the Zeiss microscope.

TI  - Sub-Inhibitory Concentrations of Oxacillin, but Not Clindamycin, Linezolid, or
      Tigecycline, Decrease Staphylococcal Phenol-Soluble Modulin Expression in
      Community-Acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - e0080821
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00808-21 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a major human pathogen producing virulence factors,
      such as Panton-Valentine-leucocidin (PVL), alpha-hemolysin (Hla), and
      phenol-soluble-modulins alpha (PSMalpha), including delta-hemolysin (Hld). Unlike
      oxacillin, clindamycin and linezolid subinhibitory concentrations (sub-MIC)
      display an anti-toxin effect on PVL and Hla expression. Few studies have
      investigated PSMalpha and Hld expression modulation by antibiotics. Herein, we
      assessed the effect of antibiotic sub-MIC on PSMalpha1 and Hld expression for 4
      community-acquired methicillin-resistant SA (CA-MRSA), 2 strains belonging to
      USASA300 and 2 strains belonging to ST80 European clone. SA were grown under
      oxacillin, clindamycin, linezolid, or tigecycline. After incubation, culture
      pellets were used for the determination of psmalpha1, pmtB, pmtR mRNA, and RNAIII
      levels by relative quantitative RT-PCR. PSMalpha1 and Hld expressions were
      measured in supernatant using high-performance-liquid-chromatography coupled to
      mass-spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Oxacillin sub-MIC reduced PSMalpha1 and Hld
      production, partially related to mRNA variations. For other antibiotics, effects 
      on toxin expression were strain or clone dependent. Antibiotic effect on mRNA did
      not always reflect protein expression modulation. Variations of pmtB, pmtR mRNA, 
      and RNAIII levels were insufficient to explain toxin expression modulation.
      Altogether, these data indicate that PSMalpha and Hld expressions are modulated
      by antibiotics (potential anti-toxin effect of oxacillin) differently compared to
      PVL and Hla. IMPORTANCE Staphylococcal toxins play an important role in the
      physiopathology of staphylococcal infections. Subinhibitory concentrations
      (sub-MIC) of antibiotics modulate in vitro toxins expression in S. aureus:
      clindamycin (CLI) and linezolid (LIN) display an anti-toxin effect on
      Panton-Valentine leucocidin and alpha-hemolysin production, while oxacillin (OXA)
      has an inducing effect. Few studies have focused on the modulation of
      phenol-soluble modulins alpha (PSMalpha) including delta-hemolysin expression by 
      sub-MIC antibiotics. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects 
      of sub-MIC antibiotics on the expression of PSMalpha toxins for 4
      community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) clinical isolates.
      The data presented herein confirm that OXA sub-MICs constantly inhibit PSMalpha
      production for CA-MRSA. Certain strains of S. aureus are highly sensitive to
      sub-MICs of protein synthesis inhibitory agents, resulting in an important
      increase of mRNA levels to overcome the intrinsic ribosome blockage ability of
      these antibiotics, eventually translating in increased expression of toxins.

TI  - Species-Wide Phylogenomics of the Staphylococcus aureus Agr Operon Revealed
      Convergent Evolution of Frameshift Mutations.
PG  - e0133421
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01334-21 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a prominent nosocomial pathogen that causes several
      life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia and bacteremia. S. aureus modulates 
      the expression of its arsenal of virulence factors through sensing and
      integrating responses to environmental signals. The agr (accessory gene
      regulator) quorum sensing (QS) system is a major regulator of virulence
      phenotypes in S. aureus. There are four agr specificity groups each with a
      different autoinducer peptide sequence encoded by the agrD gene. Although agr is 
      critical for the expression of many toxins, paradoxically, S. aureus strains
      often have nonfunctional agr activity due to loss-of-function mutations in the
      four-gene agr operon. To understand patterns in agr variability across S. aureus,
      we undertook a species-wide genomic investigation. We developed a software tool
      (AgrVATE; https://github.com/VishnuRaghuram94/AgrVATE) for typing and detecting
      frameshift mutations in the agr operon. In an analysis of over 40,000 S. aureus
      genomes, we showed a close association between agr type and S. aureus clonal
      complex. We also found a strong linkage between agrBDC alleles (encoding the
      peptidase, autoinducing peptide itself, and peptide sensor, respectively) but not
      agrA (encoding the response regulator). More than 5% of the genomes were found to
      have frameshift mutations in the agr operon. While 52% of these frameshifts
      occurred only once in the entire species, we observed cases where the recurring
      mutations evolved convergently across different clonal lineages with no evidence 
      of long-term phylogenetic transmission, suggesting that strains with agr
      frameshifts were evolutionarily short-lived. Overall, genomic analysis of agr
      operon suggests evolution through multiple processes with functional consequences
      that are not fully understood. IMPORTANCE Staphylococcus aureus is a globally
      pervasive pathogen that produces a plethora of toxic molecules that can harm host
      immune cells. Production of these toxins is mainly controlled by an active agr
      quorum-sensing system, which senses and responds to bacterial cell density.
      However, there are many reports of S. aureus strains with genetic changes leading
      to impaired agr activity that are often found during chronic bloodstream
      infections and may be associated with increased disease severity. We developed an
      open-source software called AgrVATE to type agr systems and identify mutations.
      We used AgrVATE for a species-wide genomic survey of S. aureus, finding that more
      than 5% of strains in the public database had nonfunctional agr systems. We also 
      provided new insights into the evolution of these genetic mutations in the agr
      system. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of a common but
      relatively understudied means of virulence regulation in S. aureus.

AB  - Background The potential of phage therapy for the treatment of endovascular
      Staphylococcus aureus infections remains to be evaluated. Methods and Results The
      efficacy of a phage cocktail combining Herelleviridae phage vB_SauH_2002 and
      Podoviriae phage 66 was evaluated against a methicillin-sensitive S. aureus
      strain in vitro and in vivo in a rodent model of experimental endocarditis. Six
      hours after bacterial challenge, animals were treated with (1) the phage
      cocktail. (2) subtherapeutic flucloxacillin dosage, (3) combination of the phage 
      cocktail and flucloxacillin, or (4) saline. Bacterial loads in cardiac
      vegetations at 30 hours were the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were phage
      loads at 30 hours in cardiac vegetations, blood, spleen, liver, and kidneys. We
      evaluated phage resistance 30 hours post infection in vegetations of rats under
      combination treatment. In vitro, phages synergized against S. aureus planktonic
      cells and the cocktail synergized with flucloxacillin to eradicated biofilms. In 
      infected animals, the phage cocktail achieved bacteriostatic effect. The addition
      of low-dose flucloxacillin elevated bacterial suppression ( of -5.25 log10 colony
      forming unit/g [CFU/g] versus treatment onset, P<0.0001) and synergism was
      confirmed ( of -2.15 log10 CFU/g versus low-dose flucloxacillin alone, P<0.01).
      Importantly, 9/12 rats given the combination treatment had sterile vegetations at
      30 hours. In vivo phage replication was partially suppressed by the antibiotic
      and selection of resistance to the Podoviridae component of the phage cocktail
      occurred. Plasma-mediated inhibition of phage killing activity was observed in
      vitro. Conclusions Combining phages with a low-dose standard of care antibiotic
      represents a promising strategy for the treatment of S. aureus infective
      endocarditis.

PG  - 470-481
LID - 10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00797 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause a wide
      spectrum of infections, from superficial skin inflammation to severe and
      potentially fatal and invasive diseases. Due to the many potential routes of
      infection, host-derived environmental signals (oxygen availability, nutrients,
      etc.) are vital for host colonization and thus contribute to SA's pathogenesis.
      To uncover the direct effects of environmental factors on SA metabolism, we
      performed a series of experiments in diverse culture environments and correlated 
      our findings of SA's metabolic adaptation to some of the pathogen's known
      virulence factors. Untargeted metabolomics was conducted on a Thermo Q-Exactive
      high-resolution mass spectrometer. We detected 260 intracellular polar
      metabolites from our bacteria cultured under both aerobic and anaerobic
      conditions and in glucose- and dextrin-supplemented cultures. These metabolites
      were mapped to relevant metabolic pathways to elucidate the adaptive metabolic
      processes of both methicillin-sensitive SA (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant SA
      (MRSA). We also detected an increased expression of virulence genes agr-I and sea
      of MRSA supplemented with both glucose and dextrin by qPCR. With the metabolic
      data collected that may be associated with the adaptive growth and virulence of
      SA, our study could set up the foundations for future work to identify metabolic 
      inhibitors/modulators to mitigate SA infections in different growth environments.

TI  - Analyzing risk factors for treatment failure in fracture-related infection.
LID - 10.1007/s00402-021-04277-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fracture-related infection (FRI) represents a challenging clinical 
      scenario. Limited evidence exists regarding treatment failure after initial
      management of FRI. The objective of our investigation was to determine incidence 
      and risk factors for treatment failure in FRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      conducted a retrospective review of patients treated for FRI between 2011 and
      2015 at three level 1 trauma centers. One hundred and thirty-four patients
      treated for FRI were identified. Demographic and clinical variables were
      extracted from the medical record. Treatment failure was defined as the need for 
      repeat debridement or surgical revision seven or more days after the presumed
      final procedure for infection treatment. Univariate comparisons were conducted
      between patients who experienced treatment failure and those who did not.
      Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify independent
      associations with treatment failure. RESULTS: Of the 134 FRI patients, 51 (38.1%)
      experienced treatment failure. Patients who failed were more likely to have had
      an open injury (31% versus 17%; p = 0.05), to have undergone implant removal (p =
      0.03), and additional index I&D procedures (3.3 versus 1.6; p < 0.001). Most
      culture results identified a single organism (62%), while 15% were culture
      negative. Treatment failure was more common in culture-negative infections (p =
      0.08). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was the most common
      organism associated with treatment failure (29%; p = 0.08). Multivariate
      regression demonstrated a statistically significant association between treatment
      failure and two or more irrigation and debridement (I&D) procedures (OR 13.22,
      95% CI 4.77-36.62, p < 0.001) and culture-negative infection (OR 4.74, 95% CI
      1.26-17.83, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of treatment failure following FRI
      continues to be high. Important risk factors associated with treatment failure
      include open fracture, implant removal, and multiple I&D procedures. While MRSA
      remains common, culture-negative infection represents a novel risk factor for
      failure, suggesting aggressive treatment of clinically diagnosed cases remains
      critical even without positive culture data. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Retrospective
      cohort study; Level III.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that causes hyperglycemia. In COVID-19
      patients the severity of the disease depends on myriad factors but diabetes
      mellitus is the most important comorbidity. The current review was conducted to
      investigate the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and disease severity of COVID-19 in type 
      2 diabetes mellitus patients and relevant treatment. The literature published in 
      PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was reviewed up to September
      2021. The keywords including SARS-CoV-2, type 2 diabetes mellitus in COVID-19,
      hyperglycemia in COVID-19, opportunistic infections in type 2 diabetes mellitus
      and COVID-19 were used in different combinations. Hyperglycemic individuals
      over-express ACE-2 receptors in the lungs thus increasing the SARS-CoV-2
      susceptibility and replication. Although dipeptidyl peptidase-4 plays an
      important role in glucose homeostasis, additionally it also stimulates the
      production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha creating a
      cytokine storm. Cytokine storm might be responsible for respiratory insufficiency
      in severe COVID-19 patients. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with
      immunosuppression and the patients are prone to get many opportunistic
      infections. Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with severe COVID-19 have
      lymphopenia. Moreover, in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients the neutrophils
      exhibit decreased chemotaxis, hydrogen peroxide production, and phagocytosis.
      Reduction in lymphocyte count and defective neutrophil capacity renders them with
      COVID-19 susceptible to opportunistic bacterial and fungal infections increasing 
      the mortality rate. The opportunistic bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients
      were due to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia, and
      coagulase-negative Staphylococci, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella
      sp. In COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, mucormycosis was found to
      be the most common fungal infection with a higher predilection to males.
      Hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus enhances the
      SARS-CoV-2 replication with an adverse outcome. A strong correlation exists
      between the poor prognosis of COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Proper
      glycemic control in COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus might lessen the
      severity of the disease.

TI  - Characterization of the Aminosugar Biosynthetic and Regulatory Genes of
      Vicenistatin in Monodonata labio-Associated Streptomyces parvus SCSIO Mla-L010.
PG  - 256-263
LID - 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c01044 [doi]
AB  - Vicenistatin (1) is a potent polyketide antitumor antibiotic composed of a
      20-membered macrolactam core appended to a unique aminosugar, vicenisamine. In
      this study, vicenistatin was isolated and its biosynthetic gene cluster
      identified from Monodonata labio-associated Streptomyces parvus SCSIO Mla-L010. A
      set of five genes, vicC, vicD, vicE, vicF, and vicG, was confirmed to be involved
      in the biosynthesis of the aminosugar by gene inactivations. VicG was
      characterized as an N-methyltransferase that catalyzes the methylation of the
      4'-amino group in the last step of the aminosugar biosynthetic pathway; the
      N-demethyl intermediate 4'-N-demethylvicenistatin (2) was isolated from the
      DeltavicG mutant strain. In addition, vicR1 was characterized as a positive
      pathway-specific regulatory gene. Notably, N-demethyl compound 2 was found to
      exert impressive antibacterial activities, with MIC values spanning 0.06-4
      mug/mL, against a panel of Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative Helicobacter pylori, and mycobacterium
      Mycobacterium smegmatis and the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Compound 2 was 
      also found to display reduced cytotoxicities relative to vicenistatin, especially
      against noncancerous human cell lines.

TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of 12 medicinal plant ethyl
      acetate extracts using LC-MS feature-based molecular networking.
LID - 10.1002/pca.3103 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Widespread use of antibiotics has led to an increase in bacterial
      multiple drug resistance, thereby searching for natural antimicrobial agents from
      plants becomes an effective and alternative approach. In the present study, we
      selected six foodborne bacteria to evaluate the antibacterial activities of 12
      medicinal plants ethyl acetate (EA) extracts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to
      search for natural antibiotic substitutes from plant extracts. The antibacterial 
      components were further discussed through chemometric and mass spectroscopic
      analyses. METHODOLOGY: Agar well diffusion and the microdilution methods were
      used to test the antibacterial activity. Total phenolic content (TPC) and total
      flavonoid content (TFC) were used to judge the active phytochemicals. To further 
      characterise the potential antibacterial components, an ultra-performance liquid 
      chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS)
      coupled with Pearson correlation and feature-based molecular network (FBMN) were 
      proposed. RESULTS: Most of the plant extracts possessed antibacterial activity
      against Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhi. Toona sinensis shoots and
      Firmiana simplex barks showed high inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus
      aureus, Shigella dysenteriae, and Escherichia coli strains with minimum
      inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1.56, 0.78, and 0.39 mg/mL, respectively.
      Salmonella typhi was highly sensitive to Firmiana simplex barks with an
      inhibitory diameter up to 21.67 +/- 0.95 mm, and MIC at 0.78 mg/mL. Moreover,
      Toona sinensis shoots and Firmiana simplex barks had the highest TPCs.
      CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that Toona sinensis shoots, Koelreuteria
      paniculate seeds, and Firmiana simplex barks could be supplied as potential
      sources of antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, 36 potential bioactive compounds
      were identified mainly as polyphenols, glycosides, and terpenoids.

TI  - Surgical Outcome of Spinal Subdural Abscesses: A Report of Four Consecutive
      Patients and Brief Review of the Literature.
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1739210 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Spinal subdural abscesses (SSAs) are rare and have a
      poor prognosis, especially when they are diagnosed late. In the literature, most 
      cases of SSAs have been reported as case reports and small case series. In this
      study, we aimed to evaluate the surgical outcomes of four consecutive SSA
      patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed the
      medical charts of four SSA patients who underwent surgical intervention at two
      neurosurgical centers from September 2012 to September 2019. RESULTS: Our series 
      comprised four patients (three females and one male) with SSA
      (intradural-extramedullary) who were treated surgically. Holocord SSA was
      observed in two patients. The mean age was 15.1 +/- 17.1 years. Unsteady gait and
      weakness of legs was the presenting symptom in all patients. The mean
      preoperative course was 5.3 +/- 3.4 weeks. The causative pathogens were
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, and
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In the fourth case, the pathogen was non-M.
      tuberculosis. In the 44th postoperative month, the patient underwent surgery for 
      an intramedullary abscess. The causative pathogen was E. coli. Except for one
      adolescent male who was paraplegic at presentation, improvement was observed in
      all patients at their last follow-up after 54.0 +/- 35.9 months after surgery.
      CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and urgent surgical intervention are essential for a 
      good prognosis in SSA cases. We recommend drainage followed by appropriate
      antibiotics.

LID - 10.1159/000520978 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interactions between the skin barrier, immune system, and microbiome 
      underlie the development of atopic dermatitis (AD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the
      skin and nasal microbiome in relation to filaggrin gene (FLG) mutations. METHODS:
      A cross-sectional study including 77 children with difficult-to-treat AD. The
      entire encoding region of FLG was screened for mutations using single molecule
      molecular inversion probes and next-generation sequencing. Bacterial swabs from
      the anterior nares, lesional and nonlesional skin were analyzed using 16S rRNA
      sequencing. For skin samples, additional qPCR was performed for Staphylococcus
      aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. RESULTS: The prevalence of patients with a
      mutation in FLG was 40%, including 10 different mutations. Analyzing bacterial
      swabs from all three niches showed a significant effect for both niche and FLG
      mutation status on the overall microbiome composition. Using a subset analysis to
      test the effect of FLG mutation status per niche separately did not show a
      significant association to the microbiome. Shannon diversity and S. aureus
      abundance were significantly affected by the niche, but not by the presence of an
      FLG mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest only a minor role for FLG mutation
      status on the overall microbiome, which is rather caused by differences in the
      present genera than by microbe richness and evenness.

AB  - Infectious disease models are a useful tool to support within-herd disease
      control strategies. This study presents a stochastic compartment model with
      environmentally mediated transmission to represent the spread of
      livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) in a
      farrow-to-finish pig herd. The aims of the study were to (1) construct a model of
      the spread of LA-MRSA that included spread of LA-MRSA through the environment;
      (2) parameterise the model to fit previously published observational data in
      order to obtain realistic LA-MRSA transmission rates; (3) and to investigate how 
      changes in the mixing of animals in the farrowing and finishing units may affect 
      the prevalence of LA-MRSA in a herd. The results showed that indirect
      transmission allowed LA-MRSA to persist in the herd without the assumption of
      persistently shedding individuals. Reducing the mixing of pigs upon entry to the 
      finishing unit was also shown to lower the LA-MRSA prevalence in the unit if the 
      initial LA-MRSA level in the unit was low, but at high prevalence, no effect of
      mixing was identified. In the farrowing unit, changing the proportion of piglets 
      that were cross-fostered did not affect the within-herd LA-MRSA prevalence. The
      study demonstrates that there are several important knowledge gaps regarding the 
      shedding and transmission of LA-MRSA in different animal age groups and further
      experimental studies are needed. This work also provides a new, robust and
      flexible model framework for the investigation of control and mitigation
      strategies for LA-MRSA and other infections in a pig herd.

AB  - Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) effect approximately 1.5 million
      individuals worldwide. Among the causes of HAIs in Latin America, Staphylococcus 
      aureus presents a severe danger due to its rapid spread and ease of developing
      antibiotic resistance. Upon acquiring methicillin resistance, it receives the
      classification Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), responsible
      for 40 to 60% of HAIs. The increase in resistant microorganisms led to the search
      for alternative methods, such as antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy (aPDT),
      forming Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), leading bacterial cells to death. The
      objective of this work was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial action of PDT
      with curcumin in MRSA biofilm. The strains were induced to form biofilm and
      incubated with curcumin for 20 min, irradiated with LED (Light Emitting Diode)
      450 nm, at 110 mW/cm2, 50 J/cm2 for 455 s, subsequently counting the Colony
      Forming Units, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs, Confocal
      Microscopy images, Resazurin dye test, ROS quantification to assess the effect of
      PDT on biofilm. The results show that PDT with curcumin reduced the biofilm
      growth of the MRSA strain. In addition, confocal microscopy showed that curcumin 
      was internalized by S. aureus in the cells at the concentration used, and when
      isolated, curcumin and the irradiation parameter did not show cytotoxicity. The
      study demonstrated that the PDT in the established parameters reduced the growth 
      of the MRSA strain biofilm, making it a relevant alternative possibility for the 
      inactivation of this strain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early reports have shown that critically ill patients infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 have a high prevalence of nosocomial pneumonia, particularly
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHOD: In the present study, we
      determined the bacterial agents isolated from endotracheal aspirate (ETA)
      cultures of Covid-19 general intensive care patients and evaluated the antibiotic
      resistance profiles of common bacterial agents compared to the pre-pandemic
      period. RESULTS: While a total of 119 significant growths with polymicrobial
      growths were detected in the ETA cultures of 73 (7.5%) of 971 patients
      hospitalized in the intensive care unit before the pandemic, 87 significant
      growths were detected in the ETA cultures of 67 (11.1%) of 602 patients
      hospitalized in the Covid-19 intensive care unit (ICU) after the pandemic. While 
      61 (83.6%) of patients in the ICU died before the pandemic, 63 (94.0%) of
      patients in the Covid-19 ICU died after the pandemic. In terms of age, gender,
      and mortality, there was no significant difference between the two ICUs (p >
      0.05). Before the pandemic, the mean length of stay in the ICU was 33.59 +/-
      32.89 days, and after the pandemic, it was 13.49 +/- 8.03 days. This was a
      statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). Acinetobacter baumannii (28.5%),
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (22.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.9%), Staphylococcus
      aureus (6.7%), Escherichia coli (7.5%), Candida spp. (5.0%) were the most
      prevalent causal microorganisms discovered in pre-pandemic ICU ETA samples,
      whereas A. baumannii (54.0%), K. pneumoniae (10.3%), P. aeruginosa (6.8%), E.
      faecium (8%), and Candida spp.(13.7%) were the most common causative
      microorganisms detected in Covid-19 ICU ETA samples. Except for tigecycline,
      antibiotic resistance rates in A. baumannii strains increased following the
      pandemic. Only tobramycin showed a significant difference in the increase of
      resistance among these antibiotics (p = 0.037). The rate of tigecycline
      resistance, on the other hand, was 17.6% before the pandemic and 2.2% afterward
      (p < 0.05). After the pandemic, increased resistance of K. pneumoniae strains to 
      colistin, meropenem, ertapenem, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,
      piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, tigecycline, and cefepime antibiotics was
      observed. However, these increases were not statistically significant. Except for
      imipenem, antibiotic resistance rates in P. aeruginosa strains increased
      following the pandemic. The increase in resistance of ceftazidime and
      levofloxacin was statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: As a result,
      the Covid-19 pandemic requires intensive care follow-ups at an earlier age and
      with a more mortal course. Although the length of stay in the intensive care unit
      has been shortened, it is observed that this situation is observed due to early
      mortality. In P. aeruginosa strains, a significant difference was detected in the
      resistance increase of the ceftazidime and levofloxacin (p < 0.05) and with the
      exception of tigecycline, antibiotic resistance rates in A. baumannii strains
      increased following the pandemic. Only tobramycin showed a significant difference
      in the increase of resistance among these antibiotics (p = 0.037). Secondary
      infections in patients create more difficult treatment processes due to both
      Covid-19 and increasing antibiotic resistance today.

AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility patterns were correlated with particular spa types,
      and this correlation would help physicians select appropriate antibiotics for
      treatment of invasive MRSA infections. The aim of this research was to
      investigate invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) through
      delineatingthe molecular typing results and correlating them with antibiotic
      susceptibility. Totally 670 non-duplicate mecA+MRSA isolates from patients with
      invasive infections were collected from a 5-year nationwide antimicrobial
      surveillance program (TIST), and 58 spa types were identified among 639 (95.4%)
      isolates by determining the allelic profile of the spa gene with PCR and
      nucleotide sequencing. Six major types, including spa t002 (103, 15.3%) and t037 
      (253, 37.8%), were classified as healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA, 53.1%);
      while t437 (151, 22.5%), t441 (13, 1.9%), t1081 (19, 2.8%), and t3525 (14, 2.1%) 
      were classified as community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA, 29.4%). Antimicrobial
      susceptibility was performed with agar or microbroth dilutions for various
      antibiotics and the Etest was used for both daptomycin and vancomycin. The
      declining trend in the vancomycin MIC was in parallel with an increasing
      frequency of CA-MRSA. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns were correlated with
      particular spa types, and this correlation would help physicians select
      appropriate antibiotics for treatment of invasive MRSA infections.

TI  - Fibrin(ogen) engagement of S. aureus promotes the host antimicrobial response and
      suppression of microbe dissemination following peritoneal infection.
PG  - e1010227
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010227 [doi]
AB  - The blood-clotting protein fibrin(ogen) plays a critical role in host defense
      against invading pathogens, particularly against peritoneal infection by the
      Gram-positive microbe Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we tested the hypothesis that 
      direct binding between fibrin(ogen) and S. aureus is a component of the primary
      host antimicrobial response mechanism and prevention of secondary microbe
      dissemination from the peritoneal cavity. To establish a model system, we showed 
      that fibrinogen isolated from FibgammaDelta5 mice, which express a mutant form
      lacking the final 5 amino acids of the fibrinogen gamma chain (termed
      fibrinogengammaDelta5), did not support S. aureus adherence when immobilized and 
      clumping when in suspension. In contrast, purified wildtype fibrinogen supported 
      robust adhesion and clumping that was largely dependent on S. aureus expression
      of the receptor clumping factor A (ClfA). Following peritoneal infection with S. 
      aureus USA300, FibgammaDelta5 mice displayed worse survival compared to WT mice
      coupled to reduced bacterial killing within the peritoneal cavity and increased
      dissemination of the microbes into circulation and distant organs. The failure of
      acute bacterial killing, but not enhanced dissemination, was partially
      recapitulated by mice infected with S. aureus USA300 lacking ClfA. Fibrin polymer
      formation and coagulation transglutaminase Factor XIII each contributed to
      killing of the microbes within the peritoneal cavity, but only elimination of
      polymer formation enhanced systemic dissemination. Host macrophage depletion or
      selective elimination of the fibrin(ogen) beta2-integrin binding motif both
      compromised local bacterial killing and enhanced S. aureus systemic
      dissemination, suggesting fibrin polymer formation in and of itself was not
      sufficient to retain S. aureus within the peritoneal cavity. Collectively, these 
      findings suggest that following peritoneal infection, the binding of S. aureus to
      stabilized fibrin matrices promotes a local, macrophage-mediated antimicrobial
      response essential for prevention of microbe dissemination and downstream host
      mortality.

TI  - Proteomic Correlates of Enhanced Daptomycin Activity Following beta-Lactam
      Pre-Conditioning in Daptomycin-Resistant Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus.
PG  - AAC0201721
LID - 10.1128/AAC.02017-21 [doi]
AB  - Clinical treatment options for daptomycin (DAP)-resistant (DAP-R)
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are relatively
      limited. Current therapeutic strategies often take advantage of potential
      synergistic activity of DAP plus beta-lactams; however, the mechanisms underlying
      their combinatorial efficacy are likely complex and remain incompletely
      understood. We recently showed that in vitro beta-lactam passaging can
      re-sensitize DAP-R strains to a DAP-susceptible (DAP-S) phenotype. To further
      investigate the implications of selected beta-lactam pre-treatments on DAP +
      beta-lactam combination efficacy we utilized DAP-R strain D712. We studied six
      such combinations, featuring beta-lactams with a broad range of
      penicillin-binding protein-targeting profiles (PBPs 1-4), using DAP-R strain
      D712. Of note, preconditioning with each beta-lactam antibiotic (sequential
      exposures), followed by DAP exposure, yielded significantly enhanced in vitro
      activity as compared to either DAP treatment alone or simultaneous exposures to
      both antibiotics. To explore the underpinnings of these outcomes, proteomic
      analyses were performed, with or without beta-lactam preconditioning. Relative
      proteomic quantitation comparing beta-lactam pre-treatments (vs untreated
      controls) identified differential modulation of several well-known metabolic,
      cellular, and biosynthetic processes, i.e., the autolytic and riboflavin
      biosynthetic pathways. Moreover, these differential proteomic readouts with
      beta-lactam preconditioning were not PBP target-specific. Taken together, these
      studies suggest that the cellular response to beta-lactam preconditioning in
      DAP-R MRSA leads to distinct and complex changes in the proteome that appear to
      resensitize such strains to DAP-mediated killing.

TI  - Isolation and Characterization of Antimicrobial Peptides Isolated from Fagonia
      bruguieri.
LID - 10.1007/s12010-022-03818-7 [doi]
AB  - The majority of pathogenic microorganisms have developed resistance to commercial
      antibiotics. It causes the risk of illness relapse with current antimicrobial
      therapy regimens; additional and/or different antibacterial drugs are needed to
      treat diseases caused by these pathogenic microorganisms. The applied analysis in
      the present study was purification and characterization of plant peptides
      isolated from the leaves of Fagonia bruguieri as well as their antibacterial
      activities against Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus
      subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, in
      addition to Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
      The minimum inhibitory concentration for the isolated peptide ranges from 25 to
      62.5 mg/mL. The methanolic solvent was used for the extraction followed by
      reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for purification of
      peptides. Eventually, the peptide characterization and identification were also

TI  - Species-Scale Genomic Analysis of Staphylococcus aureus Genes Influencing Phage
      Host Range and Their Relationships to Virulence and Antibiotic Resistance Genes.
PG  - e0108321
LID - 10.1128/msystems.01083-21 [doi]
AB  - Phage therapy has been proposed as a possible alternative treatment for
      infections caused by the ubiquitous bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus.
      However, successful therapy requires understanding the genetic basis of host
      range-the subset of strains in a species that could be killed by a particular
      phage. We searched diverse sets of S. aureus public genome sequences against a
      database of genes suggested from prior studies to influence host range to look
      for patterns of variation across the species. We found that genes encoding
      biosynthesis of molecules that were targets of S. aureus phage adsorption to the 
      outer surface of the cell were the most conserved in the pangenome. Putative
      phage resistance genes that were core components of the pangenome genes had
      similar nucleotide diversity, ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions,
      and functionality (measured by delta-bitscore) to other core genes. However,
      phage resistance genes that were not part of the core genome were significantly
      less consistent with the core genome phylogeny than all noncore genes in this
      set, suggesting more frequent movement between strains by horizontal gene
      transfer. Only superinfection immunity genes encoded by temperate phages inserted
      in the genome correlated with experimentally determined temperate phage
      resistance. Taken together, these results suggested that, while phage adsorption 
      genes are heavily conserved in the S. aureus species, HGT may play a significant 
      role in strain-specific evolution of host range patterns. IMPORTANCE
      Staphylococcus aureus is a widespread, hospital- and community-acquired pathogen 
      that is commonly antibiotic resistant. It causes diverse diseases affecting both 
      the skin and internal organs. Its ubiquity, antibiotic resistance, and disease
      burden make new therapies urgent, such as phage therapy, in which viruses
      specific to infecting bacteria clear infection. S. aureus phage host range not
      only determines whether phage therapy will be successful by killing bacteria but 
      also horizontal gene transfer through transduction of host genetic material by
      phages. In this work, we comprehensively reviewed existing literature to build a 
      list of S. aureus phage resistance genes and searched our database of almost
      43,000 S. aureus genomes for these genes to understand their patterns of
      evolution, finding that prophages' superinfection immunity correlates best with
      phage resistance and HGT. These findings improved our understanding of the
      relationship between known phage resistance genes and phage host range in the
      species.

TI  - In vitro bioactivity of 3D microstructure hydroxyapatite/collagen based-egg white
      as an antibacterial agent.
LID - 10.1002/jbm.b.35009 [doi]
AB  - The present study aims to design 3D scaffold hydroxyapatite (HA)/collagen (Coll) 
      based egg-white (EW) as antibacterial properties. The calcium source in HA
      synthesis derived from the Pinctada maxima shell cultivated on Bali Island has
      proven biocompatibility, and the compressive strength exceeded human bone. HA
      synthesis by precipitation with heat treatment in oven-dried at 80 degrees C
      (HA-80) and annealed at 900 degrees C (HA-900), has crystallinity 48% and 85%,
      respectively, were used for scaffold design. The physicochemical properties of
      X-ray diffractometer spectra showed that increasing temperature affected the
      crystallinity and HA phase formed. Furthermore, the crystal structure of HA
      changed in nanocomposite due to the substitution of Coll and EW, and the Fourier 
      transform infrared spectroscopy spectra confirmed that the absorption peak of the
      phosphate group (1027-1029 cm(-1) ) decreased intensity, presumably by protein
      binding of EW and Coll. The cell viability of HA/Coll/EW in 24, 48, and 72 h
      incubation period was 112.34 +/- 4.36, 104.89 +/- 3.41, 72.88 +/- 6.85,
      respectively. The decreases of cell viability due to high cell density and
      reduced nutrients in wells. Antibacterial activity of HA/Col/EW exhibited a
      strong zone of inhibition against bacteria causing periodontitis; Porphyromonas
      gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and
      Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential factors affecting methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization and infection in patients with human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. METHODS: A systematic search of
      publications listed in electronic from inception up to August 2020 was conducted.
      A random-effects model was used to calculate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence 
      interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 31 studies reporting 1410 MRSA events in 17
      427 patients with HIV infection were included. Previous hospitalization (OR 1.80;
      95% CI 1.37, 2.36), previous antibiotic therapy (OR 2.69; 95% CI 2.09, 3.45),
      CD4+ count (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.41, 2.28), Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention classification of stage C (OR 2.66; 95% CI 1.80, 3.93), skin lesions
      (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.15, 3.55), intravenous device use (OR 2.61; 95% CI 1.59, 4.29)
      and an MRSA colonization history (OR 6.30; 95% CI 2.50, 15.90) were significantly
      associated with an increased risk of MRSA colonization and infection.
      Antiretroviral therapy (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.50, 0.99) and current antibiotic use
      (OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.05, 0.32) were significantly associated with a reduced risk of
      MRSA colonization and infection. CONCLUSION: MRSA colonization and infection in
      HIV-infected patients is associated with a number of risk factors.

TI  - Biogenic synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles mediated from Borassus flabellifer
      (Linn): antioxidant, antimicrobial activity against clinical pathogens, and
      photocatalytic degradation activity with molecular modeling.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-021-18074-1 [doi]
AB  - Borassus flabellifer leaf extract has been used for rapid biogenic synthesis of
      zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) due to rich source of bioactive compounds. The
      synthesized ZnO-NPs were preliminarily confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy
      adsorption peak range at 365 nm. The XRD (X-ray diffraction) confirms purity of
      ZnO-NPs that were crystalline in nature. The analysis of FT-IR (Fourier-transform
      infrared spectroscopy) confirms the presence of the following functional group
      such as alcohol, phenols, carboxylic acids, primary amides, secondary amides, and
      alkyl halide. The Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) analysis
      indicated that ZnO-NPs were in spherical shape, followed by EDX analysis which
      confirmed the presence of Zn-element. Antimicrobial effect of ZnO-NPs was
      investigated using different clinical pathogens like bacteria Staphylococcus
      aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella Pneumonia, and
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungi Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, and
      Penicillium expansum which confirmed ZnO-NPs efficiency as an antimicrobial
      agent. ZnO-NP antimicrobial efficiency was observed in higher zone of inhibition 
      at 50 mug/mL concentrations. Antioxidant activity was ascertained to be used for 
      several biomedical applications. The ZnO-NPs efficiently degraded the
      environmental toxic dyes (methylene blue and crystal violet) under sunlight, and 
      up to 95% higher degradation was achieved in both dyes. In support of photo light
      degradation, the study was progressed to understand the ZnO-dye interaction
      stability using molecular mechanism, and it shows efficient bonding features in
      the NPs environment. Overall, this investigation has great potential for being an
      effective and eco-friendly material used in environmental applications.

TI  - In vitro efficacy of Azadirachta indica leaf extract against methicillin
      resistant Staphylococci isolated from skin infection.
PG  - 2303-2308
AB  - In this cross-sectional study, the isolation and identification of Methicillin
      Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Methicillin Resistant S. epidermidis
      (MRSE) was described from skin infections (n=100). Initial isolation was done by 
      conventional procedures followed by amplification/ sequence analysis of 16S rRNA.
      Methicillin resistance was determined using cefoxitin discs and resistant
      isolates were screened for mec-A gene followed by Minimum Inhibitory
      Concentrations (MIC) determination of vancomycin. In second phase, we
      investigated extract of Azadirachta indica leaves using Fourier Transformed
      Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR-Spectroscopy) and investigated in vitro activity.
      Initially, total of 28 Staphylococci were identified. 16S rRNA gene sequence
      confirmed S. aureus (22), S. epidermidis (3) and S. saprophyticus (3) isolates.
      Cefoxitin discs showed (7/22) MRSA, (3/3) (MRSE) and none of the methicillin
      resistant S. saprophyticus. MRSA and MRSE isolates showed presence of mec-A gene.
      However, all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin MIC (0.5-2mug/mL) and
      sensitive to Linezolid. FTIR-Spectroscopy of A. indica indicated the presence of 
      azadirachtin and nimbolinin. The mean zone of inhibition was measured
      14.23+/-1.37 and 13.66+/-0.70 against MRSA and MRSE isolates, respectively.
      Altogether, MRSA and MRSE is significant public health concern. However,
      vancomycin and linezolid were found effective and extract of A. indica showed in 
      vitro effects.

TI  - Comparative Genomics of Borderline Oxacillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      Detected during a Pseudo-outbreak of Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus in a
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
PG  - e0319621
LID - 10.1128/mbio.03196-21 [doi]
AB  - Active surveillance for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a
      component of our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infection prevention
      efforts. Recent atypical trends prompted review of 42 suspected MRSA isolates.
      Species identification was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption
      ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and methicillin
      resistance was reevaluated by PBP2a lateral flow assay, cefoxitin/oxacillin
      susceptibility testing, mecA and mecC PCR, and six commercially available MRSA
      detection agars. All isolates were confirmed S. aureus, but only eight were MRSA 
      (cefoxitin resistant, PBP2a positive, mecA positive, growth on all MRSA screening
      agars). One MRSA isolate was cefoxitin susceptible but PBP2a and mecA positive,
      and the remaining 33 were cefoxitin susceptible, PBP2a negative, and mecA
      negative; interestingly, these isolates grew inconsistently across MRSA screening
      agars and had susceptibility profiles consistent with that of borderline
      oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA). Comparative genomic analyses found these
      BORSA isolates to be phylogenetically diverse and not representative of clonal
      expansion or shared gene content, though clones of two NICU strains were
      infrequently observed over 8 months. We identified 6 features-substitutions and
      truncations in PBP2, PBP4, and GdpP and beta-lactamase hyperproduction-that were 
      used to generate a random forest classifier to distinguish BORSA from
      methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) in our cohort. Our model demonstrated a 
      robust ability to predict the BORSA phenotype among isolates collected across two
      continents (validation area under the curve [AUC], 0.902). Taking these findings 
      together, we observed an unexpected prevalence of BORSA in our NICU, BORSA
      misclassification by existing MRSA screening methods, and markers that are
      together discriminatory for BORSA and MSSA within our cohort. This work has
      implications for epidemiological reporting of MRSA rates for centers using
      different screening methods. IMPORTANCE In this study, we found a high prevalence
      of Staphylococcus aureus isolates exhibiting a borderline oxacillin resistance
      phenotype (BORSA) in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) serendipitously due 
      to the type of MRSA screening agar used by our laboratory for active surveillance
      cultures. Subsequent phenotypic and molecular characterization highlighted an
      unexpected prevalence and variability of BORSA isolates. Through whole-genome
      sequencing, we interrogated core and accessory genome content and generated a
      random forest classification model to identify mutations and truncations in the
      PBP2, PBP4, and GdpP proteins and beta-lactamase hyperproduction, which
      correlated with BORSA and MSSA phenotypes among S. aureus clinical isolates
      collected across two continents. In consideration of these findings, this work
      will help clinical microbiology laboratories and clinicians identify MRSA
      screening shortfalls and draw attention to the non-mecA-mediated BORSA phenotype.

TI  - Septic arthritis of the fingers: is short-term oral antibiotic therapy
      appropriate?

AB  - The management of septic arthritis of the hand is poorly described and there is
      no consensus. It is based on how septic arthritis of the large joints is managed,
      despite certain specificities related to the hand, typically involving inpatient 
      management and intravenous antibiotic therapy. The primary objective of this work
      was to evaluate our postoperative protocol for the management of septic arthritis
      of the hand with short-term antibiotic therapy. The secondary objective was to
      determine the risk factors for treatment failure. We conducted a retrospective,
      descriptive, single-center study and analyzed the medical records of patients
      managed for septic arthritis of the fingers over a 1-year period from January
      2018 to December 2018. We collected patient demographics and all pre-, intra-,
      and postoperative data. A total of 128 patients were included. The median age was
      52.4 years (41-66). An exogenous source of contamination was reported in 98% of
      cases (animal bite, plant thorn, wound, cyst trituration, etc.). The most
      frequently isolated microorganism was Staphylococcus aureus (45%), followed by
      Streptococcus spp. (22%) and Pasteurella spp. (18%). The vast majority of
      patients (79%) were treated with oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. This treatment
      was continued in 91% of patients after microbiological results were obtained for 
      a median treatment duration of 8 days (7-15). Nine percent of patients failed
      treatment. The risk factors identified were crush wounds (p = 0.04), initial
      radiological abnormalities (chondrolysis and/or osteolysis) (p = 0.016) and
      infection with Pasteurella spp. (p = 0.015). Our study suggests that simplified
      antibiotic therapy is feasible for the management of septic arthritis of the hand
      with short duration, broad spectrum oral antibiotics in the absence of identified
      risk factors.

AB  - The covalent grafting of alkyl gallates onto pectin using a lipase-catalyzed
      reaction in a tetrahydrofuran/aqueous medium process acylated pectin molecules
      with excellent antioxidant and antibacterial properties. The alkyl gallates
      including methyl, ethyl, and propyl gallates were enzymatically grafted onto
      pectin molecule, in order to study the effect of alkyl gallates on the functional
      modification of pectin. The grafting mechanism was analyzed by
      ultraviolet-visible spectrum (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectrum
      (FTIR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)HNMR), and density functional
      theory (DFT). Results suggested that lipase grafted 4-OH of alkyl gallate onto
      pectin by catalyzing esterification in organic/aqueous solution, and the grafting
      rate was affected by the length of alkyl chain of the gallates molecule. In vitro
      experiments, the acylated pectins exhibited stronger antioxidant activity in the 
      DPPH test and beta-carotene bleaching test and were found to have obvious
      antimicrobial performance against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.

TI  - Tocilizumab for COVID-19 treatment. An Argentine report.
PG  - 13-20
AB  - Recently it has been demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of tocilizumab (TCZ)
      associated with systemic steroids for the treatment of severe SARS-CoV-2
      pneumonia with rapid progression. The objective of this work was to describe the 
      epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and evolution characteristics of the
      patients who received this treatment. Between March and June 2021, TCZ was
      administered in a cohort study of adults with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, in a
      private hospital in the City of Buenos Aires; 30 patients were included, 63% men,
      middle age 55 years. Obesity (33%), arterial hypertension (26%) and diabetes
      (25%) were the most frequent comorbidities. We found associated infections during
      hospitalization in half of the cohort, within them, pneumonia associated with
      mechanical ventilation was the most frequent and methicillin-sensitive
      Staphylococcus aureus, the most prevalent germ. Patients with secondary
      infections had a higher requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)
      (100% vs. 19% p < 0.001) and more days of hospitalization (median 23 vs. 15 p =
      0.009). Of the entire cohort, seven who died during hospitalization had the
      highest requirement for IMV (100% vs. 43% p = 0.010) and secondary infections
      (100% vs. 35%, p = 0.006). In this relatively young cohort of patients with
      severe or critical SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, obesity does not appear to be a
      predisposing factor for superinfection or death. The presence of secondary
      infections, organ failure and shock are presented as probable factors of worse
      evolution, as well as the requirement of IMV.

      impractically located mycotic aneurysm.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1080/00015458.2022.2030127 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycotic aortic aneurysms (MAA) arise due to infection of a
      pre-existent aneurysm or aneurysmal degeneration of an infected vascular wall.
      MAA of the thoracic aorta are relatively rare. Treatment is mainly guided by
      clinical experience as there are no large randomized trials available. CASE
      PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old patient was hospitalized with staphylococcus aureus
      sepsis and MAA originating from the ostium of the left common carotid artery
      (CCA). Initial treatment consisted of high-dose antibiotics and blood pressure
      control. After 48 hours, a CT-angiography revealed rapid growth of the MAA with
      imminent rupture. Various treatment options were considered: a covered stent in
      the left CCA, a carotid-subclavian bypass with ligation of the left CCA ostium or
      arch replacement, or an extra-anatomical transposition of the supra-aortic
      vessels combined with a thoracic endoprosthesis. The last option was selected
      and, combined with six weeks of antibiotics, proved successful in controlling the
      impending rupture and treating the MAA. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular techniques are 
      used if open surgery is refused, when surgical risks are prohibitively high (as
      definitive or palliative treatment), or as an emergency temporary treatment until
      definitive surgical treatment is feasible. Our high-risk patient underwent
      endovascular treatment for MAA as a definitive treatment. Endovascular treatment 
      is increasingly becoming the treatment of choice due to the high morbidity and
      mortality of open surgical repair. Although the main concern using endovascular
      treatment is absence of debridement, recent studies show that combining
      endovascular treatment and long-term antibiotic therapy represents a potentially 
      durable treatment and viable alternative to open surgical repair.

TI  - Muscle-inspired MXene/PVA hydrogel with high toughness and photothermal therapy
      for promoting bacteria-infected wound healing.
LID - 10.1039/d1bm01604k [doi]
AB  - The process of wound healing is often accompanied by bacterial infection, which
      is a serious threat to human health. The abuse of antibiotics in traditional
      therapy aggravates the resistance of bacteria and gradually reduces the
      therapeutic effect. Therefore, it is important to develop effective antibacterial
      dressings to promote wound healing and prevent infection. Photothermal therapy
      (PTT) is considered a quick and reliable method of suppressing bacterial
      infections without developing drug resistance. The unique network structure and
      high water retention of hydrogel help wound healing. Inspired by the hierarchical
      assembly of anisotropic structures across multiple length scales of muscles,
      herein a directional freezing-assisted salting-out method was used to prepare
      anisotropic MXene@PVA hydrogels. The hydrogel not only had excellent mechanical
      properties (stress up to 0.5 MPa and strain up to 800%), but could also be used
      for local hyperthermia of infected sites using an NIR laser (808 nm). Owing to
      the excellent photothermal properties of MXene, its main antibacterial mechanism 
      is hyperthermia and the hydrogel showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity
      against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (inhibition rates of Escherichia
      coli and Staphylococcus aureus were 98.3 and 95.5% respectively). In addition, it
      could effectively promote the proliferation of NIH-3T3 cells. In mouse wound
      models, the hydrogel was effective in inhibiting wound infection and promoting
      skin wound healing (the rate of wound closure was 98%). These results indicated
      that the MXene@PVA hydrogel, with high toughness and anisotropy properties, has
      the potential to be an excellent antibacterial wound healing dressing.

TI  - Cholesterol Microdomain Enhances the Biofilm Eradication of Antibiotic Liposomes.
PG  - e2101745
LID - 10.1002/adhm.202101745 [doi]
AB  - Resistance and tolerance of biofilms to antibiotics is the greatest challenge in 
      the treatment of bacterial infections. Therefore, developing an effective
      strategy against biofilms is a top priority. Liposomes are widely used as
      antibiotic drug carriers; however, common liposomes lack affinity for biofilms.
      Herein, biofilm-targeted antibiotic liposomes are created by simply adjusting
      their cholesterol content. The tailored liposomes exhibit significantly enhanced 
      bacterial inhibition and biofilm eradication effects that are positively
      correlated with the cholesterol content of liposomes. The experiments further
      demonstrate that this enhanced effect can be ascribed to the effective drug
      release through the pores, which are formed by the combination of cholesterol
      microdomains in liposomal lipid bilayers with membrane-damaged toxins in
      biofilms. Consequently, liposome encapsulation with a high cholesterol
      concentration improves noticeably the pharmacodynamics and biocompatibility of
      antibiotics after pulmonary administration. This work may provide a new direction
      for the development of antibiofilm formulations that can be widely used for the
      treatment of infections caused by bacterial biofilms.

PG  - 173-185
LID - 10.1007/s10534-021-00358-1 [doi]
AB  - A series of phenanthroline-oxazine ligands were formed by a cyclisation reaction 
      between L-tyrosine amino acid esters and 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione
      (phendione). The methyl derivative of the phenanthroline-oxazine ligand 1 was
      complexed with Ag(I), Mn(II) and Cu(II) to form [Ag(1)2]ClO4, [Mn(1)3](ClO4)2 and
      [Cu(1)3](ClO4)2. The activity of these metal complexes was tested against the
      bacteria Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Each of the metal complexes 
      was more active than 1 against S. aureus and the Mn(II) and Cu(II) complexes also
      showed greater activity than 1 towards E. coli. The effect of increasing the
      length of the alkyl moiety on the phenanthroline-oxazine ligands and their
      corresponding tris homoleptic Cu(II) complexes was investigated. In all cases
      both the ligands and their complexes were more active against Gram-positive S.
      aureus than against Gram-negative E. coli. Differences in the lipophilicity of
      the ligands and their corresponding Cu(II) complexes did alter the antibacterial 
      activity, with the hexyl and octyl derivatives and their complexes showing the
      greatest activity and comparing well with clinically used antibiotics. The most
      active Cu(II) complexes and their respective ligands were also active against
      Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In vivo toxicity studies, conducted using
      the Galleria mellonella model, showed that all of the compounds were well
      tolerated by the insect larvae.

TI  - Medical gloves modified by a one-minute spraying process with blood-repellent,
      antibacterial and wound-healing abilities.
LID - 10.1039/d1bm01212f [doi]
AB  - During clinical surgery, bleeding that occurs in the operative region is
      inevitable. Due to the blood adhesion on ordinary medical gloves, it reduces
      surgery quality to a certain extent and even prolongs operation time. Herein, we 
      show that medical blood-repellent gloves (MBRG) can be obtained by spraying the
      blood-repellent mist spray (MS) on the surface of ordinary medical gloves, which 
      are available for immediate use in around one minute. After the modification,
      MBRG not only have a significantly higher blood repellent rate than that of
      ordinary medical gloves, but also can effectively inhibit the growth of
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), and even
      promote the healing of infected wounds. MS is easy to prepare, low-toxic, and can
      be widely used on the surface of various medical gloves, such as rubber gloves,
      polyethylene film gloves, and nitrile gloves, which may have an impact on the
      development of future medical gloves.

AB  - Background: Acute meningitis or encephalitis (AME) results from a neurological
      infection causing high case fatality and severe sequelae. AME lacked
      comprehensive surveillance in China. Methods: Nation-wide surveillance of all-age
      patients with AME syndromes was conducted in 144 sentinel hospitals of 29
      provinces in China. Eleven AME-causative viral and bacterial pathogens were
      tested with multiple diagnostic methods. Findings: Between 2009 and 2018, 20,454 
      AME patients were recruited for tests. Based on 9,079 patients with
      all-four-virus tested, 28.43% (95% CI: 27.50%29.36%) of them had at least one
      virus-positive detection. Enterovirus was the most frequently determined virus in
      children <18 years, herpes simplex virus and Japanese encephalitis virus were the
      most frequently determined in 18-59 and >/=60 years age groups, respectively.
      Based on 6,802 patients with all-seven-bacteria tested, 4.43% (95% CI:
      3.94%4.91%) had at least one bacteria-positive detection, Streptococcus
      pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis were the leading bacterium in children aged
      <5 years and 5-17 years, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the most
      frequently detected in adults aged 18-59 and >/=60 years. The pathogen spectrum
      also differed statistically significantly between northern and southern China.
      Joinpoint analysis revealed age-specific positive rates, with enterovirus, herpes
      simplex virus and mumps virus peaking at 3-6 years old, while Japanese
      encephalitis virus peaked in the >/=60 years old. As age increased, the positive 
      rate for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli statistically
      significantly decreased, while for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus suis
      it increased. Interpretation: The current findings allow enhanced identification 
      of the predominant AME-related pathogen candidates for diagnosis in clinical
      practice and more targeted application of prevention and control measures in
      China, and a possible reassessment of vaccination strategy. Funding: China

      cycle progression.
PG  - e3
LID - 10.1017/S2633903X21000027 [doi]
AB  - Fluorescence microscopy is a critical tool for cell biology studies on bacterial 
      cell division and morphogenesis. Because the analysis of fluorescence microscopy 
      images evolved beyond initial qualitative studies, numerous images analysis tools
      were developed to extract quantitative parameters on cell morphology and
      organization. To understand cellular processes required for bacterial growth and 
      division, it is particularly important to perform such analysis in the context of
      cell cycle progression. However, manual assignment of cell cycle stages is
      laborious and prone to user bias. Although cell elongation can be used as a proxy
      for cell cycle progression in rod-shaped or ovoid bacteria, that is not the case 
      for cocci, such as Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we describe eHooke, an image
      analysis framework developed specifically for automated analysis of microscopy
      images of spherical bacterial cells. eHooke contains a trained artificial neural 
      network to automatically classify the cell cycle phase of individual S. aureus
      cells. Users can then apply various functions to obtain biologically relevant
      information on morphological features of individual cells and cellular
      localization of proteins, in the context of the cell cycle.

TI  - Green Fabrication of Bioactive Silver Nanoparticles Using Mentha pulegium Extract
      under Alkaline: An Enhanced Anticancer Activity.
PG  - 1494-1504
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.1c06267 [doi]
AB  - Fabrication of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Chinese herbal medicine is
      popular as the bioactive components included in them would generate potential
      synergistic effect with the metal nanoparticles. The leaf of Mentha pulegium,
      whose extract contains a range of phytochemicals and exhibits a wide spectrum of 
      bioactivities, is used as Chinese herbal medicine after drying naturally. Thus,
      the green synthesis of AgNPs using Mentha pulegium has aroused interests from
      analysts. However, the biosynthesis of AgNPs under alkaline conditions and the
      biological activities remain elusive, where alkaline conditions may influence the
      physicochemical properties and the biological activities of biosynthesized AgNPs.
      In this study, we were stimulated to fabricate bioactive AgNPs using Mentha
      pulegium extract under alkaline conditions, accompanied by a systematic
      evaluation on the effect of biosynthesis parameters on the formation, average
      size, and polydispersity of AgNPs. Our results showed that alkaline conditions
      could accelerate the formation of AgNPs with a small average size but at a
      disadvantage to the polydispersity. Additionally, the as-prepared AgNPs had a
      hexagonal structure and spherical shape with an average size of 15.7 +/- 0.1 nm, 
      existing in the monodispersed form and revealing a high degree of stability. The 
      AgNPs exhibited potent antioxidant and significant inhibitory activity for both
      bacterial and cancer cell lines. The MIC values of AgNPs for Staphylococcus
      aureus and Escherichia coli were both 50.0 mug.mL(-1), and the IC50 values for
      HCT116, HepG2, and HeLa cells were 9.0, 14.5, and 31.5 mug.mL(-1), respectively. 
      The AgNPs biosynthesized using M. pulegium under alkaline conditions, which had a
      smaller size and more surface loads, are entirely different with those
      synthesized under acidic conditions, and the anticancer activity increased
      significantly. The internalization of AgNPs inside these five cells displayed a
      variant trend with variable AgNPs concentrations, suggesting the different
      mechanism of cell death. For two pathogens, HCT116 and HepG2 cancer cell lines,
      both cell wall and intracellular damage may be responsible for the cell death.
      However, for Hela cell line the cell death may be rooted in oxidative stress or
      intracellular penetration. These results confirmed that the AgNPs biosynthesized 
      from M. pulegium extract under alkaline conditions would act as better anticancer
      agents in biomedicine.

TI  - Clindamycin Efficacy in Patients With Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
      in a Fourth-Level Hospital in the City of Medellin.
PG  - e21124
LID - 10.7759/cureus.21124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antibiotic of choice for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
      aureus (MSSA) bacteremia is antistaphylococcal penicillins, such as oxacillin,
      but cefazolin has also risen as an equally effective alternative. Murine models
      have suggested that clindamycin is a therapeutic alternative for Staphylococcus
      aureus bacteremia (SAB). METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients
      from the Hospital Universitario San Vicente Fundacion (HUSVF) in Medellin,
      Colombia, were recruited from January 2013 and December 2019. Patients with
      positive blood culture for MSSA, with at least one follow-up blood culture, and
      those with more than 72 hours of parenteral antibiotic therapy for SAB were
      selected. The main objective was to determine the efficacy of clindamycin
      compared to other antibiotics to achieve a microbiologic cure. Secondary results 
      included in-hospital mortality and hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 486
      patients were included (clindamycin = 50 and other anti-MSSA = 436). The patients
      in the clindamycin group had a lower rate of microbiological cure (n = 41 [84%]) 
      compared to other antibiotics (n = 367 [84%]) (OR 1.08 IC 95% 0.74-1.58). In
      secondary outcomes, no statistically significant differences were observed in the
      in-hospital mortality. The main source of SAB was a central or peripheral
      catheter (58%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study found no differences in the rate of
      microbiological cure, in-hospital mortality, and hospital stay on the clindamycin
      group compared to other anti-MSSA antibiotics. However, in patients with
      metastatic complications, the rate of microbiological cure is reduced, and the
      in-hospital mortality is higher in patients with more severe disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to evaluate the optimal and financially efficient
      numbers of blood cultures (BC) required in our chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      patients with suspected bloodstream infections (BSI). DESIGN: This is a
      prospective, cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of
      Nephrology, The Kidney Center Post-Graduate-Training-Institute, Karachi from July
      2020 to December 2020. METHODS: Single, two, or three BC were taken from CKD
      patients with suspected BSI within the first 24 hours and were incubated in the
      BACTEC 1050 CMBCS for five days. A positive culture was reported as per standard 
      protocol. RESULTS: Four hundred and eighty-three BC sets were collected from 272 
      patients. A single set of BC was obtained from 111 (40.8%), two sets from 111
      (40.8%), and three from 50 (18.4%) patients. BC from 93 patients showed growth of
      organisms in at least one set. Fifty-six (60.2%) episodes of BSI were detected
      with the first set, 34 (36.5%) with the second set, and 03 (3.2%) with the third 
      set of BC. The detection rate of BSI was 60.2% with the first set, 97.7% with the
      first two sets, and 100% with the first three sets of BC. The most common source 
      of infection was central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) (33.3%), 
      followed by urinary tract (29%), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (16%), 
      and arteriovenous fistula (AVF) (7.5%). 93.5% episodes of BSI, were
      monomicrobial. The most common monomicrobial organism was methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (22.6%). CONCLUSION: Two properly collected BC sets 
      might be sufficient for an adequate diagnosis of BSI, in CKD patients especially 
      in resource-limited settings.

TI  - Identification of key genes associated with sepsis patients infected by
      staphylococcus aureus through weighted gene co-expression network analysis.
PG  - 13579-13589
AB  - The prevention and treatment of staphylococcus aureus septicemia is one of the
      thorniest problems in modern medicine. However, as the underlying pathogenesis of
      sepsis is still unclear, there is currently no golden standard for clinical
      diagnosis. In this study, we used GSE33341 dataset for differentially expressed
      gene (DEG) analysis and screened out 857 differentially expressed genes
      associated with staphylococcus aureus infection. The module having the highest
      correlation with clinical features of sepsis was screened by weighted gene
      co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The genes in the selected module and the 
      differentially expressed genes were represented in Venn diagram, and 59
      pathogenic genes at the intersection were obtained. GO and KEGG analysis showed
      that these genes were mainly related to aerobic respiration, cellular stress
      response, mitochondrial electron transport, mitochondrial transport, oxidative
      phosphorylation. Kaplan-Meier was used to analyze the influence of the top 10 key
      genes on the prognosis of sepsis patients. The results showed that the high
      expression of NDUFA4, NDUFB3, COX7A2, ATP5J and COX7C was significantly
      correlated with the poor overall survival (OS) in patients with bacterial sepsis.
      These findings may potentially provide a reference for the diagnosis and
      treatment of bacterial septicemia.

TI  - Silver-titanium polymeric nanocomposite non ecotoxic with bactericide activity.
PG  - 1-20
LID - 10.1007/s00289-021-04036-7 [doi]
AB  - In view of the intense interest in applications of silver nanoparticles in
      products for the medical field and in food preservation packaging due to their
      antimicrobial properties, the ecotoxicology of silver nanocomposites was
      evaluated in films. Test with the sea urchin Echinometra lucunter, to evaluate
      embryonic development and contamination by the action of silver and titanium
      nanoparticles in polyethylene nanocomposite films presents new results. The
      silver nanoparticle's stability in polymeric materials can be enhanced by adding 
      carriers, such as titanium dioxide and montmorillonite clay (MMT) without to
      producing one unfriendly material. For this research, low-density polyethylene
      (LDPE)/linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) were used processed in a
      twin-screw extruder, followed by gamma irradiation with 25 kGy and characterized 
      by ecotoxicology assays, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM),
      scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDX),
      differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), Raman
      spectroscopy (SERS) and mechanical properties. The antibacterial properties of
      the LDPE films were investigated against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
      aureus. The gamma irradiation had an important effect in the synthesis of silver 
      nanoparticles resulting in bactericidal activity and the death of 100% of the
      tested bacteria. The evaluation of the environment was considered with the
      ecotoxicological investigation carried out. The results indicated that the
      polymeric films with silver nanoparticles and TiO2 do not contaminate the
      environment and neither interfere with the larval development of Echinometra
      lucunter. The obtained materials can be used in various applications with
      antimicrobial properties.

TI  - "Dual-functional" strontium titanate nanotubes designed based on fusion peptides

AB  - Currently, there is an increasing clinical demand for implants that effectively
      resist bacterial infections while promoting osseointegration. In this study, the 
      fusion peptide technology was used to linearly fuse the antimicrobial peptide
      (AMP, HHC36) and the bone-promoting peptide (RGD), so that the titanium
      (Ti)-based implant modified by the polypeptide had the dual function of
      "antibacterial-promoting bone". Firstly, self-organized vertically-oriented
      strontium-doped titanium dioxide nanotubes (STN) were manufactured by anodizing
      and hydrothermal synthesis methods. Secondly, the fusion peptide (HHC36-RGD) was 
      loaded into the tubular structure by a simple vacuum-assisted physical adsorption
      method. Finally, STN loaded with HHC36-RGD (H-R-STN) was obtained. The
      characterization results demonstrated that the surface of the H-R-STN had a
      roughness and hydrophilicity that promoted cell adhesion. Additionally,
      electrochemical tests showed that H-R-STN coating can reduce the corrosion rate
      of pure Ti. The fusion peptide and Sr(2+) in H-R-STN were released in the initial
      fast and subsequent slow kinetic model. Expected, H-R-STN can kill more than 99% 
      of clinically common pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia
      coli), and significantly inhibit the formation of bacterial biofilms.
      Simultaneously, under the synergistic effect of RGD in the fusion peptide and
      strontium in STN, H-R-STN markedly promoted the adhesion and proliferation of
      mouse osteoblasts, and significantly promoted osteogenic markers (alkaline
      phosphatase, runt-related transcription, collagen, mineralization) expression. In
      summary, the bifunctional titanium-based implant constructed by H-R-STN in this
      article can effectively prevent bacterial infections and promote early
      osseointegration. The main advantage of the titanium surface treatment method of 
      the study was that its simplicity, low cost, especially its versatility made it a
      promising anti-infective bone repair material.

AB  - In this research we developed a micro-sized hierarchical structures on a
      poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) surface. The obtained structures consist of round-shaped
      protrusions with a diameter of ~20 mum, a height of ~3 mum, and the distance
      between them ~30 mum. We explored the effect of structuring PLLA to design a
      non-cytotoxic material with increased roughness to encourage cells to settle on
      the surface. The PLLA films were prepared using the casting melt extrusion
      technique and were modified using ultra-short pulse irradiation - a femtosecond
      laser operating at lambda = 1030 nm. A hierarchical microstructure was obtained
      resembling 'cookies on a tray'. The cellular response of fibro- and osteoblasts
      cell lines was investigated. The conducted research has shown that the
      laser-modified surface is more conducive to cell adhesion and growth (compared to
      unmodified surface) to such an extent that allows the formation of
      highly-selectively patterns consisting of living cells. In contrast to eukaryotic
      cells, the pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus covered modified and
      unmodified structures in an even, non-preferential manner. In turn, adhesion
      pattern of eukaryotic fungus Saccharomyces boulardii resembled that of fibro- and
      osteoblast cells rather than that of Staphylococcus. The discovered effect can be
      used for fabrication of personalized and smart implants in regenerative medicine.

AB  - Over the last 25 years, the biology of membrane proteins, including the
      PFPs-membranes interactions is seeking attention for the development of
      successful drug molecules against a number of infectious diseases. Pore forming
      toxins (PFTs), the largest family of PFPs are considered as a group of virulence 
      factors produced in a large number of pathogenic systems which include
      streptococcus, pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis, group A and B streptococci, Corynebacterium diphtheria and many
      more. PFTs are generally utilized by the disease causing pathogens to disrupt the
      host first line of defense i.e. host cell membranes through pore formation
      strategy. Although, pore formation is the principal mode of action of the PFTs
      but they can have additional adverse effects on the hosts including immune
      evasion. Recently, structural investigation of different PFTs have imparted the
      molecular mechanistic insights into how PFTs get transformed from its inactive
      state to active toxic state. On the basis of their structural entity, PFTs have
      been classified in different types and their mode of actions alters in terms of
      pore formation and corresponding cellular toxicity. Although pathogen genome
      analysis can identify the probable PFTs depending upon their structural
      diversity, there are so many PFTs which utilize the local environmental
      conditions to generate their pore forming ability using a novel strategy which is
      known as "conformational switch" of a protein. This conformational switch is
      considered as characteristics of the phase shifting proteins which were often
      utilized by many pathogenic systems to protect them from the invaders through
      allosteric communication between distant regions of the protein. In this chapter,
      we discuss the structure function relationships of PFTs and how activity of PFTs 
      varies with the change in the environmental conditions has been explored.
      Finally, we demonstrate these structural insights to develop therapeutic
      potential to treat the infections caused by multidrug resistant pathogens.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are global
      health challenges. The burden of antibiotic resistance in HAIs is still unclear
      in low- and lower-middle-income countries (L-LMICs). This study summarizes recent
      data on antibiotic resistance in priority HAIs (ESKAPE-E) in L-LMICs and compares
      them with data from high-income countries (HICs). EMBASE, Web of Science, and
      Global Index Medicus were searched for studies on AMR patterns in HAIs published 
      from 01/2010 to 10/2020. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to obtain
      pooled estimates. In total, 163 eligible studies were included in the review and 
      meta-analysis. The pooled methicillin resistance proportion in Staphylococcus
      aureus was 48.4% (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 41.7-55.2, n = 80). Pooled
      carbapenem resistance proportions were high in Gram-negative pathogens:
      Escherichia coli: 16.6% (95%CI 10.7-23.4, n = 60); Klebsiella pneumoniae: 34.9%
      (95%CI 24.6-45.9, n = 50); Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 37.1% (95%CI 24.6-45.9, n =
      56); Enterobacter spp.: 51.2% (95%CI 27.5-74.7, n = 7); and Acinetobacter
      baumannii (complex): 72.4% (95%CI 62.1-81.7%, n = 36). A higher resistance
      proportions were observed for third-generation cephalosporins: Klebsiella
      pneumoniae: 78.7% (95%CI 71.5-85.2, n = 46); Escherichia coli: 78.5% (95%CI
      72.1-84.2%, n = 58); and Enterobacter spp.: 83.5% (95%CI 71.9-92.8, n = 8). We
      observed a high between-study heterogeneity (I(2) > 80%), which could not be
      explained by our set of moderators. Pooled resistance proportions for
      Gram-negative pathogens were higher in L-LMICs than regional and national
      estimates from HICs. Patients in resource-constrained regions are particularly
      affected by AMR. To combat the high resistance to critical antibiotics in
      L-LMICs, and bridge disparities in health, it is crucial to strengthen local
      surveillance and the health systems in general.

TI  - Simultaneous Production of Antibacterial Protein and Lipopeptides in Bacillus

AB  - As antibiotic resistance is nowadays one of the important challenges, efforts are
      crucial for the discovery of novel antibacterial drugs. This study aimed to
      evaluate antimicrobial/anticancerous activities of halophilic bacilli from the
      human microbiota. A spore-forming halotolerant bacterium with antibacterial
      effect against Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from healthy human feces. The
      antibacterial protein components of the extracted supernatant were identified by 
      SDS-PAGE and zymography. The MALDI-TOF, GC mass, and FTIR analyses were used for 
      peptide and lipopeptide identification, respectively. The stability, toxicity,
      and anticancerous effects were investigated using MTT and Flow cytometry methods.
      According to the molecular analysis, the strain was identified as Bacillus
      tequilensis and showed potential probiotic properties, such as bile and acid
      resistance, as well as eukaryotic cell uptake. SDS-PAGE and zymography showed
      that 15 and 10-kDa fragments had antibacterial effects. The MALDI-TOF mass
      analysis indicated that the 15-kDa fragment was L1 ribosomal protein, which was
      the first report of the RpL1 in bacilli. GC-mass and FTIR analyses confirmed the 
      lipopeptide nature of the 10-kDa fragment. Both the extracted fractions
      (precipitation or "P" and chloroform or "C" fractions) were stable at < 100
      degrees C for 10 min, and their antibacterial effects were preserved for more
      than 6 months. Despite its non-toxicity, the P fraction had anticancer activities
      against MCF7 cells. The anticancer and antibacterial properties of B.
      tequilensis, along with its non-toxicity and stability, have made it a potential 
      candidate for studying the beneficial probiotic properties for humans and drug
      production.

AB  - Chronic infection as a result of bacterial biofilm formation on implanted medical
      devices is a major global healthcare problem requiring new biocompatible,
      biofilm-resistant materials. Here we demonstrate how bespoke devices can be
      manufactured through ink-jet-based 3D printing using bacterial biofilm inhibiting
      formulations without the need for eluting antibiotics or coatings. Candidate
      monomers were formulated and their processability and reliability demonstrated.
      Formulations for in vivo evaluation of the 3D printed structures were selected on
      the basis of their in vitro bacterial biofilm inhibitory properties and lack of
      mammalian cell cytotoxicity. In vivo in a mouse implant infection model,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation on poly-TCDMDA was reduced by
      approximately 99% when compared with medical grade silicone. Whole mouse
      bioluminescence imaging and tissue immunohistochemistry revealed the ability of
      the printed device to modulate host immune responses as well as preventing
      biofilm formation on the device and infection of the surrounding tissues. Since
      3D printing can be used to manufacture devices for both prototyping and clinical 
      use, the versatility of ink-jet based 3D-printing to create personalised
      functional medical devices is demonstrated by the biofilm resistance of both a
      finger joint prosthetic and a prostatic stent printed in poly-TCDMDA towards P.
      aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - A series of gallic acid-benzylidenehydrazine hybrids were synthesized and
      evaluated for their tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Thereinto, compounds 5d and
      5f potently inhibited tyrosinase with IC50 of 15.3 and 3.3 muM, compared to kojic
      acid (44.4 muM). The inhibition mechanism suggested that 5d and 5f not only
      chelated with Cu(2+), but also reduced Cu(2+) to Cu(1+) in the tyrosinase active 
      site. Additionally, 5d and 5f exhibited strong DPPH scavenging and antibacterial 
      activities against Vibrio parahaemolyticu and Staphylococcus aureus, which can be
      attributed to the function of gallic acid and hydrazone moiety. These compounds
      also exhibited capacity to preserve fresh-cut apples and shrimps. Finally, 5d and
      5f exhibited low cytotoxic activity in a human cell line (HEK293). Therefore,
      these compounds possess anti-tyrosinase, antioxidant, and antibacterial
      activities, and can be used in the development of novel food preservatives.

AB  - Many factors affecting satellitism tests are unclear, and it is difficult to
      avoid misidentification, even if the medium is properly selected. We investigated
      the factors causing false-positive results for Haemophilus influenzae and
      false-negative results for Haemophilus parainfluenzae in the satellitism tests
      using Staphylococcus aureus as the source of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
      (NAD). H. influenzae (four reference strains and 47 clinical isolates), H.
      parainfluenzae (two reference strains and 67 clinical isolates), four different
      media, and two strains of S. aureus revived on two different media were used in
      this study. The type of medium used to revive S. aureus was the most common
      factor causing false-positive results for H. influenzae, followed by different
      strains of S. aureus and the type of medium used for the experiment. The
      production of false-negative results for H. parainfluenzae was only related to
      the medium used in the experiment. To improve the accuracy of the tests in
      routine laboratories, using S. aureus as the source of NAD, tryptic soy agar, and
      S. aureus (ATCC 25923) revived on nutrient agar should be adopted.

      successful targeted suppression therapy following failure of mass suppression

AB  - BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of healthcare associated
      infection and outbreaks have been associated with neonatal units and colonisation
      of healthcare workers. AIM: To describe an outbreak of Panton-Valentine
      Leucocidin producing meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (PVL-MSSA) in a
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). METHODS: Multi-disciplinary outbreak control
      investigation RESULTS: Over a period of 16 months, 7 neonates were identified as 
      positive for PVL-MSSA. Isolates were identified in blood cultures (2 patients),
      nasopharyngeal aspirate (1 patient) and rectal screening swabs (4 patients).
      Epidemiological and whole genome sequencing data suggested a long-term carrier as
      the most likely source. Despite two rounds of mass suppression therapy of staff, 
      using chlorhexidine initially, then octenidine-based regimens, positive patients 
      continued to be identified. Staff screening subsequently identified one
      healthcare worker colonised with the outbreak strain of PVL-MSSA who underwent
      enhanced screening and further suppression therapy. No further cases have been
      identified to date. Compliance with mass suppression therapy was >95% and a post 
      administration staff satisfaction survey showed the majority of staff agreed with
      the steps taken with low rates of adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus
      aureus outbreaks are commonly associated with colonisation of healthcare workers 
      and are challenging to manage within environments such as neonatal units. Our
      study highlights the utility of whole genome sequencing in identifying and
      mapping an outbreak. We recommend that targeted staff screening should be
      considered early in similar outbreaks. In our setting mass suppression therapy
      was not an effective strategy despite a high level of staff engagement and
      compliance.

AB  - Patients in hemodialysis on central venous catheter as vascular access are at
      risk of infections. Catheter-related bloodstream infection is one of the most
      serious catheter-complications in hemodialysis patients. Its clinical and
      microbiological diagnosis is challenging. The implementation of empiric
      antibiotic therapy is based on old recommendations proposing the combination of a
      molecule targeting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a betalactamin
      active on P. aeruginosa, and also adapting this probabilistic treatment by
      carrying out a microbiological register on a local scale, which is rarely done.
      In our hemodialysis center at Bordeaux University Hospital, an analysis of the
      microorganisms causing all catheter-related bloodstream infection over the period
      2018-2020 enabled us to propose, in agreement with the infectious disease
      specialists, an adapted probabilistic antibiotic therapy protocol. This approach 
      allowed us to observe a low incidence of meticillinoresistance of Staphylococcus.
      For catheters inserted more than 6 months ago, we observed no Staphylococcus, no 
      multi-resistant Pseudomonas, and only 2% of Enterobacteria resistant to
      cephalosporins. A frequent updating of the microbiological epidemiology of
      catheter-related bloodstream infection, in partnership with the infectious
      diseases team in each hemodialysis center, allowing an adaptation of the
      probabilistic antibiotic therapy, and seems to have a good feasibility. This
      strategy might favor the preservation of microbial ecology on an individual and
      collective scale in maintenance hemodialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite clear evidence of benefits in acute-care hospitals,
      controversy over the effectiveness of IPC measures for MDROs is perceptible and
      evidence-based practice has not been established. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the
      effects of IPC interventions on MDRO colonization and infections in LTCFs. DATA
      SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception to September 2020.
      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Original and peer-reviewed articles examining the
      post-intervention effects on MDRO colonization and infections in LTCFs.
      INTERVENTIONS: (i) Horizontal interventions: administrative engagement, barrier
      precautions, education, environmental cleaning, hand hygiene, performance
      improvement, and source control; and (ii) vertical intervention: active
      surveillance plus decolonization. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS: We employed a
      random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the pooled risk ratios (pRRs) for
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization by intervention
      duration; and conducted subgroup analyses on different intervention components.
      Study quality was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tools. RESULTS: Of 3877
      studies identified, 19 were eligible for inclusion (eight randomized controlled
      trials (RCTs)). Studies reported outcomes associated with MRSA (15 studies),
      vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) (four studies), Clostridium difficile (two
      studies), and Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) (two studies). Eleven studies were
      included in the meta-analysis. The pRRs were close to unity regardless of
      intervention duration (long: RR 0.81 [95% CI 0.60-1.10]; medium: RR 0.81 [95% CI 
      0.25-2.68]; short: RR 0.95 [95% CI 0.53-1.69]). Vertical interventions in studies
      with a small sample size showed significant reductions in MRSA colonization while
      horizontal interventions did not. All studies involving active administrative
      engagement reported reductions. The risk of bias was high in all but two studies.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis did not show any beneficial effects from IPC
      interventions on MRSA reductions in LTCFs. Our findings highlight that the
      effectiveness of interventions in these facilities is likely conditional on
      resource availability-particularly decolonization and barrier precautions, due to
      their potential adverse events and uncertain effectiveness. Hence, administrative
      engagement is crucial for all effective IPC programmes. LTCFs should consider a
      pragmatic approach to reinforce standard precautions as routine practice and
      implement barrier precautions and decolonization to outbreak responses only.

TI  - Recombinant production of the lantibiotic nisin using Corynebacterium glutamicum 
      in a two-step process.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1186/s12934-022-01739-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacteriocin nisin is naturally produced by Lactococcus lactis as 
      an inactive prepeptide that is modified posttranslationally resulting in five
      (methyl-)lanthionine rings characteristic for class Ia bacteriocins. Export and
      proteolytic cleavage of the leader peptide results in release of active nisin. By
      targeting the universal peptidoglycan precursor lipid II, nisin has a broad
      target spectrum including important human pathogens such as Listeria
      monocytogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Industrial
      nisin production is currently performed using natural producer strains resulting 
      in rather low product purity and limiting its application to preservation of
      dairy food products. RESULTS: We established heterologous nisin production using 
      the biotechnological workhorse organism Corynebacterium glutamicum in a two-step 
      process. We demonstrate successful biosynthesis and export of fully modified
      prenisin and its activation to mature nisin by a purified, soluble variant of the
      nisin protease NisP (sNisP) produced in Escherichia coli. Active nisin was
      detected by a L. lactis sensor strain with strictly nisin-dependent expression of
      the fluorescent protein mCherry. Following activation by sNisP, supernatants of
      the recombinant C. glutamicum producer strain cultivated in standard batch
      fermentations contained at least 1.25 mg/l active nisin. CONCLUSIONS: We
      demonstrate successful implementation of a two-step process for recombinant
      production of active nisin with C. glutamicum. This extends the spectrum of
      bioactive compounds that may be produced using C. glutamicum to a bacteriocin
      harboring complex posttranslational modifications. Our results provide a basis
      for further studies to optimize product yields, transfer production to
      sustainable substrates and purification of pharmaceutical grade nisin.

AB  - This work demonstrated an ultrasensitive and simple microfluidic immunosensor for
      point-of-care test of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) based on the stir bar
      enrichment and DNAzyme-assisted click reaction. Initially, S. aureus was enriched
      by the 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid-functionalized stir bar. The yolk antibody
      (immunoglobulin Y) and copper-labeled polydopamine nanoparticles were then
      specifically conjugated with the captured target. The Cu(II) was released under
      acidic conditions and effectively catalyzed the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne
      cycloaddition (CuAAC) between the alkyne group-labeled DNAzyme and the
      streptavidin-biotin-azido with the assistance of DNAzyme. Finally, the
      DNAzyme-streptavidin complexes were detected by microfluidic chips to quantify S.
      aureus. Under optimum conditions, this immunosensor showed good detection
      performances toward S. aureus within 10 to 2.5 x 10(4) CFU/mL with a limit of
      detection of 3 CFU/mL. Moreover, the satisfying detection results of real samples
      of animal origin also implied that this immunosensor owned great potential in
      practical applications.

AB  - Ferrous iron and polysulfide (Fe(II)Sn aq) is a nano-decoction. It is usually
      prepared from the suspension of iron sulfide nanomaterial, using autoclave and
      centrifugation. A previous study conducted in our laboratory revealed that
      Fe(II)Sn aq was highly antibacterial, and it could efficiently kill more than 90%
      population of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, within 5 min of the
      treatment. Our study reported that the intravenous administration of Fe(II)Sn aq 
      provided effective treatment against epididymis infection, caused by S. aureus.
      The results of the study further highlighted its potential for clinical
      application. However, its effects on the reproductive system and overall health
      of mammals have not been investigated earlier. The present study assessed the
      impacts of Fe(II)Sn aq on reproductive health and other aspects of male mice.
      Briefly, male mice were exposed to Fe(II)Sn aq, either intravenously at the dose 
      of 0.7 mM, 1.4 mM, and 2.8 mM of Fe(2+)or orally at the dose of 1.4 mM, 2.8 mM,
      and 5.6 mM of Fe(2+). Following this, body weight, organs index, quality of
      sperm, blood biochemical markers, histopathology of organs, oxidative stress and 
      apoptosis were evaluated, after 1 day and 30 days of exposure. In addition, male 
      reproductivity was evaluated in terms of mating with female mice, and the body
      weight of the resulting offspring was recorded. Our results showed that the mice 
      processed with Fe(II)Sn aq exhibited normal physiological status and reproductive
      capability. The present study illustrated the short- and long-term influences of 
      Fe(II)Sn aq on the fertility of male mice for the first time. The findings of the
      study provided a valuable reference for the application of Fe(II)Sn aq,
      particularly in terms of reproductive safety.

AB  - Catabolite control protein A (CcpA) of the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus
      is an essential DNA regulator for carbon catabolite repression and virulence,
      which facilitates bacterial survival and adaptation to a changing environment.
      Here we report that copper (II) signaling mediates the DNA-binding capability of 
      CcpA in vitro and in vivo. Copper (II) catalyzes the oxidation of two cysteine
      residues (Cys216 and Cys242) in CcpA to form intermolecular disulfide bonds
      between two CcpA dimers, which results in the formation and dissociation of a
      CcpA tetramer of CcpA from its cognate DNA promoter. We further demonstrate that 
      the two cysteine residues on CcpA are important for S. aureus to resist host
      innate immunity, indicating that S. aureus CcpA senses the redox-active copper
      (II) ions as a natural signal to cope with environmental stress. Together, these 
      findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism for CcpA activity through copper
      (II)-mediated oxidation.

TI  - Severe ophthalmia neonatorum in Southwest China: a 5-year review of demographics,
      microbiological results, and risk factors.
LID - 10.1007/s10792-022-02218-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the microbiological characteristics and risk factors of
      severe ophthalmia neonatorum (ON) in Southwest China. METHODS: In this
      retrospective review, data on demography, microbiological results, and risk
      factors were analyzed. Data were obtained from medical records of patients with
      severe ON treated at Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from
      January 2015 to December 2019. To understand the risk factors for severe ON,
      maternal and neonatal factors were compared between the severe and non-severe ON 
      groups. RESULTS: A total of 1397 neonates with ON were included, of whom 12% (n =
      172) had severe ON, and 88% (n = 1225) had non-severe ON. Microbial detection and
      drug susceptibility tests were performed on 169 patients with severe ON. Culture 
      results were positive for 76 patients, with gram-positive bacteria in 71.1% (n = 
      54), gram-negative bacteria in 25.0% (n = 19), and multiple microorganisms in
      3.9% (n = 3) neonates. The most commonly detected organisms were Staphylococcus
      aureus (29%) and Staph. epidermis (27%), followed by Escherichia coli (8%).
      Neisseria gonorrhea (8%), Moraxella catarrhal (5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae
      (4%), Haemophilus influenza (4%), and Chlamydia trachomatis (1%). The main risk
      factors for severe ON were obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct (chi(2) = 10.794,
      P = 0.001), meconium aspiration syndrome (chi(2) = 6.252, P = 0.012), and
      cesarian section (chi(2) = 5.118, P = 0.024). Neonatal ocular prophylaxis was a
      protective factor for severe conjunctivitis (chi(2) = 6.905, P = 0.009).
      CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus is the most common pathogen of severe ON.
      Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is a risk factor for ON.

TI  - Bacterial profile and antimicrobial resistance patterns of common bacteria among 
      pregnant women with bacteriuria in Ethiopia: a systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s00404-021-06365-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) restricted the armamentarium
      of the health care providers against infectious diseases, mainly due to the
      emergence of multidrug resistant. This review is aimed at providing contemporary 
      bacterial profile and antimicrobial resistance pattern among pregnant women with 
      significant bacteriuria. METHODS: Electronic biomedical databases and indexing
      services such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE and Google Scholar were
      searched. Original records of research articles, available online from 2008 to
      2021, addressing the prevalence of significant bacteriuria and AMR pattern among 
      pregnant women and written in English were identified and screened. The relevant 
      data were extracted from included studies using a format prepared in Microsoft
      Excel and exported to STATA 14.0 software for the outcome measure analyses and
      subgrouping. RESULTS: The data of 5894 urine samples from 20 included studies
      conducted in 8 regions of the country were pooled. The overall pooled estimate of
      bacteriuria was 15% (95% CI 13-17%, I(2) = 77.94%, p < 0.001) with substantial
      heterogeneity. The pooled estimate of Escherichia coli recovered from isolates of
      896 urine samples was 41% (95% CI 38-45%) followed by coagulase-negative
      Staphylococci, 22% (95% CI 18-26%), Staphylococcus aureus, 15% (95% CI 12-18%),
      Staphylococcus saprophytic, 12% (95% CI 6-18%) Proteus mirabilis, 7% (95% CI
      4-10%), Enterococcus species, 6% (0-12%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4% (2-6%),
      Citrobacter species, 4% (95% CI 2-4%), Group B streptococcus, 3% (1-5%), and
      Enterobacter species, 2% (1-4%). Multidrug resistance proportions of E. coli,
      Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus aureus and Coagulase negative staphylococci,
      83% (95% CI 76-91%), 78% (95% CI 66-90%), 89% (95% CI 83-96%), and 78% (95% CI
      67-88%), respectively. CONCLUSION: The result of current review revealed the
      occurrence of substantial bacteriuria among pregnant women in Ethiopia.
      Resistance among common bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella species, Staphylococci
      species) causing UTIs in pregnant women is widespread to commonly used
      antibiotics. The high rate of drug resistance in turn warrants the need for
      regular epidemiological surveillance of antibiotic resistance and implementation 
      of an efficient infection control and stewardship program.

TI  - Nanocomposite of Ag nanoparticles and deep eutectic solvent-derived carbon dots
      with oxidase mimicking activity as synergistic bactericidal agent.
LID - 10.1111/lam.13654 [doi]
AB  - A new type of nitrogen and chloride co-doped carbon dots (N/Cl-CDs) based on
      choline chloride-urea-glycine ternary deep eutectic solvents (DESs) was
      synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal method. The prepared N/Cl-CDs exhibited
      oxidase-like activity and excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia
      coli, Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA). The addition of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) (i.e. N/Cl-CDs +Ag NPs) to 
      the N/Cl-CDs also significantly enhanced the oxidase and antibacterial
      activities. The nanocomposite (1.8 mg ml(-1) ) completely inactivated 10(5) CFU
      per ml of MRSA in 90 min. E. coli and S. aureus were labelled with the N/Cl-CDs, 
      enabling multicolour fluorescence imaging at different excitation wavelengths.
      The nanocomposites have high antibacterial efficiency as a new bactericidal
      agent, as well as application potential with good biocompatibility and low
      toxicity.

AB  - In many important industries, such as the textile printing industry, a large
      amount of dye/salt wastewater is often discharged, which can destroy the
      ecological environment of the water body. Membrane technology has a great
      potential in the treatment of environmental problems caused by dye/salt
      wastewater. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofiltration (NF) membrane has a bright
      future in dye/salt wastewater treatment, however, works on this are rare. Herein,
      antibacterial PVA NF membrane incorporated with Cu(OH)2 nanowires for the
      dye/salt wastewater treatment is reported. The membrane was prepared via coating 
      the solutions containing PVA, glutaraldehyde and Cu(OH)2 nanowires on the
      polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane. Cu(OH)2 nanowires has a diameter of 60
      nm and was successfully introduced into the membrane. The introduction of
      nanowires improved the membrane hydrophilicity and roughness, which is conducive 
      to the improvement of membrane flux. Membrane separation performance for one
      component solution and dye/salt solution were investigated. The introduction of
      Cu(OH)2 increases the flux of the membrane obviously (the highest increase is
      178.78% (from 21.49 to 38.42 L.m(-2).h(-1).bar(-1), for NaCl solution as the
      feed). Besides, the membrane doped with nanowires also possessed a high dye/salt 
      selectivity. For one component solution, the dye removal rate was over 97.00%
      while the salt rejection was low (the lowest was 13.18% (NaCl)). For the dye/salt
      solution, the dye (Congo Red) rejection kept at a high level (98.91%) and the
      salt (NaCl) rejection was still low (13.71%), while the flux was also high (37.56
      L.m(-2).h(-1).bar(-1)). The performance is superior to that of many membranes
      reported in previous works. Moreover, the Cu(OH)2 nanowires endowed the membrane 
      with an improved and high antibacterial property. The sterilization rate of
      Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus reached more than 99.99%.

AB  - Given the many issues bacterial infections cause to humans and the necessity for 
      their detection, in this work we developed a robust aptasensor for prompt,
      ultrasensitive, and selective analysis of staphylococcus aureus bacterium (S.
      aureus). A nanocomposite of Ag nanoparticles, chitosan, graphene quantum dots,
      and nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (Ag-Cs-Gr QDs/NTiO2) was synthesized, and
      thoroughly characterized by XRD, FT-IR, and FE-SEM spectroscopic methods. The
      surface of screen-printed carbon electrodes modified with Ag-Cs-Gr QDs/NTiO2
      nanocomposite was utilized as a compatible platform for aptamer attachment. The
      aptasensor accurately determined S. aureus in the dynamic range of 10-5 x 10(8)
      CFU/mL with detection limit of 3.3 CFU/mL. The monitoring of the practical
      performance of aptasensor in human serum samples revealed its superiority over
      the conventional methods (relative recovery of 96.25-103.33%). The Ag-Cs-Gr
      QDs/NTiO2-based aptasensor offers facile, biocompatibility, good repeatability,
      reproducibility (RSD = 3.66%), label free and stabile strategy for sensitive S.
      aureus analysis free from biomolecules interferences in actual specimens.

TI  - Comparative secretome analysis of Staphylococcus aureus strains with different
      within-herd intramammary infection prevalence.
PG  - 174-190
LID - 10.1080/21505594.2021.2024014 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a major pathogen causing intramammary infection and
      mastitis in dairy cows. S. aureus genotypes (GT) can differ significantly in
      their ability to diffuse and persist in the herd; while the association of
      virulence gene carriage with epidemiological behavior remains unclear, a role for
      secreted proteins has been postulated. We characterized the secretome of six S.
      aureus strains belonging to two genotypes with opposite within-herd prevalence,
      GTB (high) and GTS (low), corresponding to sequence types (ST) 8 and 398, by
      high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry and differential analysis with Proteome 
      Discoverer. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD029571. Out
      of 720 identified proteins, 98 were unique or more abundant in GTB/ST8 and 68 in 
      GTS/ST398. GTB/ST8 released more immunoglobulin-binding proteins, complement and 
      antimicrobial peptide inhibitors, enterotoxins, and metabolic enzymes, while
      GTS/ST398 released more leukocidins, hemolysins, lipases, and peptidases.
      Furthermore, GTB/ST8 released the von Willebrand factor protein, staphylokinase, 
      and clumping factor B, while GTS released the staphylococcal coagulase and
      clumping factor A. Hence, GTB/ST8 secretomes indicated a higher propensity for
      immune evasion and chronicity and GTS/ST398 secretomes for cellular damage and
      inflammation, consistent with their epidemiological characteristics. Accordingly,
      GTS/ST398 secretions were significantly more cytotoxic against bovine PBMCs in
      vitro. Our findings confirm the crucial role of extracellular virulence factors
      in S. aureus pathogenesis and highlight the need to investigate their
      differential release adding to gene carriage for a better understanding of the
      relationship of S. aureus genotypes with epidemiological behavior and, possibly, 
      disease severity.

AB  - In the current study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of main quorum
      sensing autoinducers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, C12-HSL and C4-HSL, against MDR
      Staphylococcus aureus isolates and their synergistic effects with some common
      antibiotics. Forty clinical isolates of S. aureus were collected and their
      antibiotic susceptibility pattern was evaluated. Then, 10 resistant isolates were
      selected for further studies. In the following, the antibacterial activity of
      quorum sensing C12-HSL and C4-HSL inducers of P. aeruginosa was evaluated against
      selected isolates based on the microdilution method and Time Killing assay as
      well as their synergistic activity with selected antibiotics. The ability of
      inductors to hemolysis and their cytotoxicity on CHO and HeLa cell lines was also
      assessed. For the assessment of antibacterial activity, Acinetobacter baumannii
      was used as negative control. The results demonstrated that C12 and C4 have
      antibacterial activity against MDR S. aureus isolates but had no effect on A.
      baumannii. Time Killing test showed that at 2X MIC concentration, the maximum
      inhibition (100%) is observed after 120 min for C12 and 240 min for C4. The IC50 
      of inducers was about 512 mug/ml. In addition, no synergistic effects were
      observed.

AB  - Face mask has become an essential and effective apparatus to protect human beings
      from air pollution, especially the air-borne pathogens. However, most commercial 
      face masks can hardly achieve good particulate matters (PMs) and high
      bactericidal efficacy concurrently. Herein, a bilayer structured composite filter
      medium with built-in antimicrobial activities was constructed by combining cotton
      woven modified by magnetron sputtered Ag/Zn coatings and electrospun
      poly(vinylidene fluoride)/polystyrene (PVDF/PS) nanofibers. With the benefit of
      external moisture, an electrical stimulation was generated inside the composite
      fabric and thus endowed the fabric antimicrobial function. The resultant
      composite fabric presented conspicuous performance for integrated air pollution
      control, high filtration performance towards PM0.3 (99.1%, 79.2 Pa) and
      exceptional interception ratio against Escherichia coli (99.64%) and
      Staphylococcus aureus (98.75%) within 20 min contact. The high efficiency contact
      sterilization function of the bilayer fabric could further potentially promote
      disinfection and reuse of the filter media. This work may provide a new
      perspective on designing high-performance face mask media for public health
      protection.

AB  - The emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in animals is
      an increasing concern for the agriculture and public health. A four-years (2016) 
      successional study was conducted to investigate the antimicrobial resistant
      profiles and molecular characterizations of the livestock-associated MRSA
      (LA-MRSA) from animal farms or slaughterhouses in Chongqing, China. A total of
      1667 samples were collected from 2013 to 2016 in different animal farms and hog
      markets. LA-MRSA were isolated and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility
      testing and whole genome sequencing (WGS). S. aureus was detected at a ratio of
      3.7% (n = 62), in which 18 isolates were identified as MRSA. All the S. aureus
      isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR) with the resistance to at least four
      drugs; however, none of those isolates was resistant to linezolid, vancomycin, or
      nitrofurantoin. The resistance was more obvious in the pig-associated S. aureus
      isolates than the strains associated with chickens or cows. The majority of
      multilocus sequence typing (MLST) types of the MRSA isolates were ST239,
      subsequently ST59, ST9, and ST630. Among these isolates, 18 MRSA possessed SCCmec
      type (n = 10), a (n = 4), (n = 3) and (n = 1). Multiple spa types were also
      detected in the isolates, such as 899, 437, 30, 421, 969, 37, and 4549. This
      study indicates that MRSA could be transferred between humans and animals, and
      highlights the necessity of continuous surveillance of MRSA.

TI  - Chimeric mutants of staphylococcal hemolysin, which act as both one-component and
      two-component hemolysin, created by grafting the stem domain.
LID - 10.1111/febs.16354 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus expresses several hemolytic pore-forming toxins (PFTs),
      which are all commonly composed of three domains: cap, rim and stem. PFTs are
      expressed as soluble monomers and assemble to form a transmembrane beta-barrel
      pore in the erythrocyte cell membrane. The stem domain undergoes dramatic
      conformational changes to form a pore. Staphylococcal PFTs are classified into
      two groups: one-component alpha-hemolysins (alpha-HL) and two-component
      gamma-hemolysins (gamma-HL). The alpha-HL forms a homo-heptamer, whereas
      gamma-hemolysin is an octamer composed of F-component (LukF) and S-component
      (Hlg2). As PFTs are used as materials for nanopore-based sensors, knowledge of
      the functional properties of PFTs is used to develop new, engineered PFTs.
      However, it remains challenging to design PFTs with a beta-barrel pore because
      their formation as transmembrane protein assemblies require large conformational 
      changes. In this study, to investigate the design principles of the beta-barrel
      formed as a consequence of the conformational change, chimeric mutants composed
      of the cap/rim domains of alpha-HL and a stem of LukF or Hlg2 were prepared.
      Biochemical characterization and electron microscopy showed that one of them
      assembles as a heptameric one-component PFT, while another participate as both
      heptameric one- and heptameric/octameric two-component PFT. All chimeric mutants 
      intrinsically assemble into SDS-resistant oligomers. Based on these observations,
      the role of the stem domain of these PFTs is discussed. These findings provide
      clues for the engineering of staphylococcal PFT beta-barrels for further
      promising applications.

TI  - Leadless pacemaker implantation after lead extraction for cardiac implanted
      electronic device infection.
LID - 10.1111/jce.15363 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac implanted electronic device (CIED) pocket and systemic
      infection remain common complications with traditional CIEDs and are associated
      with high morbidity and mortality. Leadless pacemakers may be an attractive
      pacing alternative for many patients following complete hardware removal for a
      CIED infection by eliminating surgical pocket-related complications as well as
      lower risk of recurrent complications. OBJECTIVE: To describe use and outcomes
      associated with leadless pacemaker implantation following extraction of a CIED
      system due to infection. METHODS: Patient characteristics and postprocedural
      outcomes were described in patients who underwent leadless pacemaker implantation
      at Duke University Hospital between November 11, 2014 and November 18, 2019,
      following CIED infection and device extraction. Outcomes of interest included
      procedural complications, pacemaker syndrome, need for system revision, and
      recurrent infection. RESULTS: Among 39 patients, the mean age was 71 +/- 17
      years, 31% were women, and the most frequent primary pacing indication was
      complete heart block (64.1%) with 9 (23.1%) patients being pacemaker dependent at
      the time of Micra implantation. The primary organism implicated in the CIED
      infection was Staphylococcus aureus (43.6%). Nine of the 39 patients had a
      leadless pacemaker implanted before or on the same day as their extraction
      procedure, and the remaining 30 patients had a leadless pacemaker implanted after
      their extraction procedure. During follow-up (mean 24.8 +/- 14.7 months) after
      leadless pacemaker implantation, there were a total of 3 major complications: 1
      groin hematoma, 1 femoral arteriovenous fistula, and 1 case of pacemaker
      syndrome. No patients had evidence of recurrent CIED infection after leadless
      pacemaker implantation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a prior CIED infection and an
      elevated risk of recurrent infection, there was no evidence of CIED infection
      with a mean follow up of over 2 years following leadless pacemaker implantation
      at or after CIED system removal. Larger studies with longer follow-up are
      required to determine if there is a long-term advantage to implanting a leadless 
      pacemaker versus a traditional pacemaker following temporary pacing when needed
      during the periextraction period in patients with a prior CIED infection.

TI  - Extensive pyomyositis secondary to paronychia-related MRSA infection: A case
      report.
PG  - e28431
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000028431 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Pyomyositis is characterized by an insidious and multifactorial
      inflammatory process, which is often caused by hematogenous pathogen.
      Predisposing risk factors include immunodeficiency, diabetes, malignancy, or
      trauma. The spectrum of clinical presentation depends on disease severity,
      typically presented by fever and hip pain. We hereby present a case with
      extensive pyomyositis secondary to chronic paronychia infection. PATIENT
      CONCERNS: A 14-year-old immunocompetent male presented with fever and hip pain.
      The patient was initially surveyed for common infectious etiologies prior to the 
      presentation of acute limping, which led to image confirmation of extensive
      pyomyositis. DIAGNOSIS: The patient presented with acute pain in the right hip
      accompanied by headache, myalgia of the right leg, and intermittent fever for a
      week. Physical examination disclosed limping gait, limited range of motion marked
      by restricted right hip flexion and right knee extension, and chronic paronychia 
      with a nail correction brace of the left hallux. Diagnosis of pyomyositis was
      confirmed by magnetic resonance image. Methicillin-resistant strains of
      Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the patient's blood and urine cultures
      within 2 days of collection. The same strain was also isolated from the pus
      culture collected via sonography-guided aspiration. INTERVENTIONS: Antibiotics
      treatment with oxacillin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, and fosfomycin were
      administered. Sonography-guided aspiration and computed tomography-guided pigtail
      drainage were arranged, along with nail extraction of his left hallux paronychia 
      prior to discharge. Oral antibiotics fusidic acid was prescribed. Total
      antibiotics course of treatment was 4 weeks. OUTCOMES: The patient gradually
      defervesced and was afebrile after drainage. Followed limb doppler sonography
      showed regression of the abscess at his right lower limb. Gait and range of
      motion gradually recovered without sequelae. LESSONS: Ambulation and quality of
      life are greatly affected by the inflammatory process of pyomyositis. Detailed
      evaluation of predisposing factors should be done, even in immunocompetent
      individuals. Timely diagnosis is vital to successful treatment.

TI  - Rifabutin versus rifampicin bactericidal and antibiofilm activities against
      clinical strains of Staphylococcus spp. isolated from bone and joint infections.
LID - dkab486 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jac/dkab486 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Staphylococci account for approximately 60% of periprosthetic joint
      infections (PJIs). Rifampicin (RMP) combination therapy is generally considered
      to be the treatment of choice for staphylococcal PJIs but carries an important
      risk of adverse events and drug-drug interactions. Rifabutin (RFB) shares many of
      the properties of rifampicin but causes fewer adverse events. OBJECTIVES: To
      compare the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), the minimum bactericidal
      concentrations (MBC), and the minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBEC)
      of rifabutin and rifampicin for staphylococcal clinical strains isolated from
      PJIs. METHODS: 132 clinical strains of rifampicin-susceptible staphylococci [51
      Staphylococcus aureus (SA), 48 Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) and 33 other
      coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS)] were studied. The MBC and the MBEC were 
      determined using the MBEC(R) Assay for rifabutin and rifampicin and were
      compared. RESULTS: When compared with the rifampicin MIC median value, the
      rifabutin MIC median value was significantly higher for SA (P < 0.05), but there 
      was no statistically significant difference for SE (P = 0.25) and CoNS (P =
      0.29). The rifabutin MBC median value was significantly higher than that of
      rifampicin for SA (P = 0.003) and was lower for SE (P = 0.003) and CoNS (P =
      0.03). Rifabutin MBEC median value was statistically lower than that of
      rifampicin for all strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Using the determination of MBEC
      values, our study suggests that rifabutin is more effective than rifampicin
      against clinical strains of Staphylococcus spp. obtained from PJIs. Using MBECs
      instead of MICs seems to be of interest when considering biofilms. In vivo higher
      efficacy of rifabutin when compared with rifampicin needs to be confirmed.

AB  - Efficient delivery of toxic compounds to bacterial competitors is essential
      during interspecies microbial warfare. Rhamnolipids (RLPs) are glycolipids
      produced by Pseudomonas and Burkholderia species involved in solubilization and
      uptake of environmental aliphatic hydrocarbons and perform as biosurfactants for 
      swarming motility. Here, we show that RLPs produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      associate to form micelles. Using high-resolution microscopy, we found that RLP
      micelles serve as carriers for self-produced toxic compounds, which they deliver 
      to Staphylococcus aureus cells, thereby enhancing and accelerating S. aureus
      killing. RLPs also potentiated the activity of lincosamide antibiotics,
      suggesting that RLP micelles may transport not only self-produced but also
      heterologous compounds to target competing bacterial species.

TI  - Bovine Mastitis: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Bacterial Pathogens Isolated in
      Lactating Cows in Gamo Zone, Southern Ethiopia.
PG  - 9-19

AB  - Purpose: Mastitis is a disease known to cause a great deal of loss of production 
      and has a major economic impact. In the study area, there is little current
      information on bovine mastitis. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the
      overall prevalence of bovine mastitis and its associated risk factors and isolate
      the major pathogenic bacteria. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted
      from February 2020 to September 2020 in selected dairy farms of Gamo Zone,
      southern Ethiopia. A total of 422 lactating cows were diagnosed for mastitis
      using the California mastitis test, clinical examination, and bacteriological
      methods. Results: The overall prevalence of bovine mastitis determined in the
      area was 17.1% (72 of 422), of which 1.9% (eight of 422) was clinical and 15.2%
      (64 of 422) subclinical. Of 1,662 quarters examined, 7.94% (132) were positive.
      Bacteriological methods were also used to isolate the major pathogenic bacterial 
      species associated with bovine mastitis. From 72 composite milk samples, growth
      of six different groups of bacteria was recorded in 64 (88.9%) samples. The most 
      predominant bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (42.6%),
      ahead of Streptococcus spp. (26.2%), non-aureus staphylococci (14.8%), and
      Escherichia coli (11.5%). Salmonella spp. (3.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6%)
      were the least isolated bacterial pathogens. Among risk factors, breed, parity,
      udder depth, and tick infestation of the udder showed statistically significant
      differences (P<0.05) regarding the occurrence of mastitis. Conclusion: The
      current study revealed that mastitis is one of the health problems affecting
      dairy cows in Gamo. Enhancing the awareness of dairy farmers, regular screening, 
      and improving hygienic conditions are critically important to control and prevent
      bovine mastitis in the study area.

AB  - P450 fatty acid decarboxylase OleT from Staphylococcus aureus (OleTSA) is a novel
      cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of fatty
      acids to yield primarily terminal alkenes and CO2 or minor alpha- and
      beta-hydroxylated fatty acids as side-products. In this work, the interactions
      between a series of cycloalkyl phosphorus heterocycles (CPHs) and OleTSA were
      investigated in detail by fluorescence titration experiment, ultraviolet-visible 
      (UV-vis) and (31)P NMR spectroscopies. Fluorescence titration experiment results 
      clearly showed that a dynamic quenching occurred when CPH-6, a representative
      CPHs, interacted with OleTSA with a binding constant value of 15.2 x 10(4) M(-1) 
      at 293 K. The thermodynamic parameters (DeltaH, DeltaS and DeltaG) showed that
      the hydrogen bond and van der Waals force played major roles in the interaction
      between OleTSA and CPHs. The UV-vis and (31)P NMR studies indicated the
      penetration of CPH-6 into the interior environment of OleTSA, which greatly
      affects the enzymatic activity of OleTSA. Therefore, our study revealed an
      effective way to use phosphorus heterocyclic compounds to modulate the activity
      of cytochrome P450 enzymes.

AB  - Surgical site infections (SSIs) and catheter-related bloodstream infections
      (CRBSIs) caused by bacteria from surfaces poorly disinfected with chlorhexidine
      gluconate (CHG) and povidone-iodine (PVP-I) are increasing. Olanexidine gluconate
      (OLG) was developed in 2015 in Japan to prevent SSI and CRBSI caused by bacteria 
      resistant to CHG and PVP-I. This scoping review aimed to identify the knowledge
      gap between what is known and what is not known about the disinfection efficacy
      of OLG. We searched MEDLINE through PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature
      (CINAHL), the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search database,
      ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Web-based database of Japanese medical articles for
      works published to July 18, 2021. Manual reference searches were also carried
      out. A total of 131 studies were screened. Forty-seven studies were included in
      this review and classified into two major categories: studies on pharmacological 
      effects and spectrum (n = 29) and studies on clinical and adverse effects (n =
      18). Olanexidine gluconate showed bactericidal activity against
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci,
      in addition to common Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In clinical
      settings, although there is limited evidence on SSI prevention, 1.5% OLG might be
      more effective than 10% PVP-I and 1% CHG in preventing SSI. However, the clinical
      usefulness of OLG is unclear due to the limited number of clinical studies. Also,
      clinical research is limited to studies targeting SSI prevention, and there are
      no clinical studies on CRBSI. Further clinical studies are needed on SSI and
      CRBSI prevention.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the performance of Rapid Sepsityper Kit in species
      identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). METHODS:
      Positive blood culture bottles (n = 227) containing single microorganisms were
      enrolled. We compared the direct method using Rapid Sepsityper Kit for ID and AST
      with the conventional method. The analyses of ID and AST were performed using
      MALDI Biotyper and BD Phoenix platform, respectively. RESULTS: The direct ID
      method correctly identified 89.4% (203/227) of samples, and Gram-negative bacilli
      (95.2%) had a higher ID rate than Gram-positive cocci (84.4%). Five cases were
      misidentified, and non-acceptable identification was high among Streptococcus
      species. Direct AST results were obtained from 168 isolates. Non-acceptable ID
      occurred among 24 isolates; 4 Streptococcus species, and 31 isolates, which did
      not grow in the direct AST method, were excluded. A total of 1714 antibiotic
      susceptibility tests (625 from 69 Gram-positive cocci and 1089 from 99
      Gram-negative bacilli) were performed. The direct AST methods showed 98.3%
      (1685/1714) of categorical agreement (CA), 0.7% (12/1714) of very major errors,
      0.2% (4/1714) of major errors, and 0.8% (13/1714) of minor errors. Complete CA
      was obtained for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. CONCLUSIONS: The
      direct ID method using Rapid Sepsityper Kit and the direct AST method in
      combination with the BD Phoenix platform, which was associated with a reduction
      of turnaround time, may be a reliable approach for blood culture bottles.
      However, additional validation and further improvements, especially for
      Gram-positive cocci, would have an impact on microbiological diagnoses.

AB  - We selected eight kinds of chitosan fibers to characterize and analyze their
      composition, surface morphology, and mechanical properties. Crucially, we
      investigated their antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli,
      Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans and the dependence on the molecular
      weight (Mw) and the degree of deacetylation (DD). On that basis, the relationship
      between antibacterial activity and Mw and DD can be established. Finally, the
      antibacterial mechanism of chitosan fiber was obtained. The results show that the
      inhibition rate of samples I, K, L, and M against Staphylococcus aureus first
      increased and then decreased with the increase of Mw, and their bactericidal
      activity against Escherichia coli decreased with the increase of Mw when the DD
      was similar. This study provides an effective strategy for characterizing the
      chitosan fiber and the resultant relationship between antibacterial property and 
      structural parameters that may benefit the enhancement of antibacterial activity 
      and application in antibacterial textiles.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Breast abscess is a common problem in breastfeeding 
      women. However, septic shock secondary to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA) from breast abscess is very rare. Successful management of this
      condition in our center may provide experience of treatment for similar patients.
      CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old breastfeeding woman with breast abscess was
      transferred to our center. General condition of the patient deteriorated rapidly 
      to life-threatening septic shock. Culture of pus later demonstrated MRSA
      infection, with vancomycin susceptibility. Several measures were emergently
      implemented, including removal of necrotic tissue, continuous catheter irrigation
      and drainage, intravenous infusion of vancomycin, pumping norepinephrine, fluid
      resuscitation and transfusion of plasma. The patient was cured and discharged
      after 10 day's treatment. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Life-threatening septic shock
      secondary to MRSA in breastfeeding women with breast abscess is very rare.
      Nevertheless, clinicians should remain vigilant to early symptoms and signs of
      septic shock. Catheter irrigation and drainage, vancomycin and fluid
      resuscitation are essential for septic shock in lactational breast abscess.
      CONCLUSIONS: We highlight the importance of the diagnosis and management of
      life-threatening septic shock secondary to MRSA in breast abscess to help us
      further understand this rare and fatal disease.

AB  - Given the rise of drug-resistant pathogens and industrial contaminants, the
      development of efficient and eco-friendly water treatment technologies and
      materials is highly desirable and urgent. Herein, a multifunctional graphene
      oxide/chitosan/copper-based polyoxometalate (GO/CS/Cu-POM) nanocomposite (Cu-POM,
      [Cu(L)4][Cu(L)3(H2O)][Cu(L)(H2O)][P2Mo5O23].4H2O, L = pyrazole) was synthesized
      by the ultrasound-assisted self-assembly strategy. The GO/CS/Cu-POM nanocomposite
      exhibited potent bactericidal properties against gram-positive/negative bacterial
      strains Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, 99.98%), Escherichia coli (E. coli,
      99.99%), and drug-resistant E. coli bacterial strains (kanamycin-resistant E.
      coli 99.93% and ampicillin-resistant E. coli, 97.94%). Further, the antibacterial
      performance was strongly dependent on synergistic effect between GO/CS and Cu-POM
      in GO/CS/Cu-POM. The destruction of bacterial membrane and high levels of
      oxidative stress induced by GO/CS/Cu-POM played a significant role in the
      bactericidal process. Furthermore, the GO/CS/Cu-POM nanocomposite also displayed 
      superior performance for removal of methylene blue (MB, 96.86%), gentian violet
      (GV, 97.77%), basic fuchsin (BF, 96.47%), tetracycline (TC, 78.92%) and
      norfloxacin (NC, 76.26%). Moreover, the main process of dye removal by
      GO/CS/Cu-POM was controlled by chemisorption. More importantly, the GO/CS/Cu-POM 
      nanocomposite indicated good biocompatibility to human umbilical vein endothelial
      cells. Current work provides an effective strategy to design multifunctional
      POM-based composites for water purification and environmental protection.

AB  - In this study, the effect of marjoram essential oil (MEO) on the mechanical,
      barrier, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of mung bean protein isolate
      (MPI)/pullulan (PU) composite films and its influence on the quality of minced
      beef meat during 14 days storage at 4 degrees C was studied. The Fourier
      transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning
      electron microscopy (SEM) results confirmed the compatibility between components.
      Also, depend on the different ratios of combination of MEO and MPI/PU, tensile
      strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB) were varied. The results showed that 
      an increase in the level of the MPI led to a significant increment in TS and
      water-proof properties of the composite films. Also, with addition of MEO, the
      EAB of the antimicrobial blend-films was decreased, while TS and water-proof
      properties were increased. In addition, enrichment of the films with MEO led to a
      considerable positive effect on DPPH radical scavenging and antibacterial
      activity against pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia
      coli). Based on the bacterial and chemical analyses of the minced meat samples,
      MEO-incorporation in MPI/PU films enhanced oxidative stability of minced beef
      samples, and also showed effective antimicrobial activity against all of the
      tested bacteria.

AB  - An effective method for reducing silver ions using gelatin (Gel) and
      2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD) hydrogels, which stabilize silver at
      various concentrations is described. The formation of AgNPs in solution, as well 
      as Gel-HPCD nanogels, is confirmed by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band at
      420-440 nm in the UV-Vis spectrum. The resulting Gel-HPCD and Gel-HPCD/AgNPs
      composites are characterized using various techniques, including scanning
      electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
      Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and
      thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). SEM images showed that the porous structure and
      the AgNPs are homogeneously dispersed throughout the Gel-HPCD/AgNP composites
      network. The AgNPs in the Gel-HPCD/AgNPs composite is crystalline, with spherical
      particles having an average size of 7.0 +/- 2.5 nm, as determined by TEM. The
      Gel-HPCD/AgNPs composites are strongly effective against both gram-positive
      (Staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. The
      assembled antibacterial Gel-HPCD/AgNPs composites are also assessed for their
      cytotoxic and anticancer activities using HCT-116 cancer cells. The results
      suggest that Gel-HPCD/AgNPs composites could be used as effective therapeutics in
      the future in tissue engineering applications, as their bactericidal properties
      and low toxicity make them ideal for clinical use.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most prevalent pathogens, and a causative
      agent of a variety of infections in humans and animals. Most studies concentrated
      on characterization of staphylococcus isolates and its antimicrobial resistance
      from various illness of veterinary importance, but there is no specific study
      that is available on isolates from reproductive tract of small ruminants and
      especially its semen. Hence, in the current study, a total of 48 semen samples
      were collected from healthy bucks of different breeds to investigate the
      occurrence of S. aureus. Antimicrobial resistance and virulence of the
      Staphylococcus isolates were determined to assess the adverse effects of them on 
      buck fertility. The bacterial isolates were tentatively confirmed as
      Staphylococcus spp. based on the Gram's staining, growth on Mannitol salt agar
      and catalase test. Overall, 75% (n = 36) of the samples were positive for
      Staphylococcus spp. from the total 48 buck semen ejaculates from different breeds
      and among them 23 (63.89%) were coagulase-negative (CoNS) and 13 (36.11%) were
      coagulase-positive Staphylococcus (CoPS) strains. The species identified by
      molecular characterization are S. aureus, S. chromogenes, S. haemolyticus, S.
      sciuri, S. simulans, and S. epidermidis from buck semen. Further, these isolates 
      exhibited varying degrees of multidrug resistance genotypically as well as
      phenotypically. The presence of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes may
      pose a potential threat to reproductive health of animals, the animal handlers
      and livestock keepers, while simultaneously highlighting the need for vigilant
      monitoring of these isolates at the time of semen cryopreservation.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus-induced septic arthritis of the ankle related to malum
      perforans in a diabetes patient.
PG  - 615-619
LID - 10.47162/RJME.62.2.31 [doi]
AB  - Septic arthritis (SA) is a less common joint pathology with potentially fatal
      outcome. It is considered a medical emergency, in which prompt diagnosis and
      differentiation of bacterial etiology is essential for appropriate management.
      The knee is the most prevalent site for SA (~50% of cases), followed by hip,
      shoulder, and elbow. Early intervention requires an accurate diagnosis and
      imaging techniques enable both a positive diagnosis, as well as arthrocentesis
      and liquid analysis, the "gold standard" criteria. We report the case of a
      70-year-old patient, with history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), diabetes mellitus
      (DM) and persistent left malum perforans in the last year, with development of a 
      severe and debilitating Staphylococcus aureus-related SA of the left ankle, which
      posed significant therapeutic challenges. He developed a plantar lesion at the
      ball of the left foot, in the past one year, which was labeled as malum perforans
      in the setting of DM. Musculoskeletal ultrasound was the primary imaging
      technique used to define the location and extent of the infectious process.
      Cultures drawn from the tissue were positive for S. aureus. After an antibiotic
      course, the apparent infectious features were remitted but the long-lasting open 
      wound failed to improve. Antibiotic therapy was initiated in accordance with
      culture sensibility tests but short- and long-term outcome was unfavorable with
      both treatment unresponsiveness and comorbidity burden posing considerable
      difficulties. The association and interrelation between different comorbidities
      (such as hypertension, diabetes, or obesity), chronic systemic inflammation
      (e.g., C-reactive protein level, disease activity), and RA medication is
      sometimes difficult to understand and to address in daily practice, and this case
      report highlights multiple toils encountered in a SA patient with RA on
      immunosuppressive therapy and complicated DM.

TI  - Synthesis of poly-tetrahydropyrimidine antibacterial polymers and research of
      their basic properties.
LID - 10.1039/d1bm01465j [doi]
AB  - Modern medicine has increasingly higher requirements for antibacterial materials.
      To overcome this challenge, we use alkynyl monomers, amino monomers,
      formaldehyde, and acetic acid as raw materials to synthesize a series of
      poly-tetrahydropyrimidine (P-THP) polymers through multicomponent polymerizations
      (MCPs). P-THP polymers can effectively inhibit the growth of Gram-positive
      bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria
      (Escherichia. coli, E. coli), and can prevent bacteria from developing drug
      resistance within at least 16 generations. Besides, we prepared P-THP
      antibacterial coatings and explored their antibacterial properties. In vitro
      antibacterial experiments showed that P-THP coatings can prevent the formation of
      bacterial biofilms, and the coatings have a lasting killing effect on E. coli and
      S. aureus. The mouse wound infection experiments proved that P-THP polymers can
      significantly accelerate skin tissue regeneration and wound healing. Moreover,
      the P-THP textile obtained by electrospinning also has antibacterial properties
      and has great application prospects in the field of N95 masks. Generally
      speaking, P-THP polymers have considerable application potential in the field of 
      treating bacterial infections and promoting wound healing.

PG  - 000295
LID - 10.1099/acmi.0.000295 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Penile implant infections are a possible surgical complication that
      has historically been most commonly associated with Gram-positive bacteria.
      Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacteria and is the most common cause of
      endocarditis. Case Presentation: A male patient in his 50s with a past medical
      history of hypertension, diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal
      dialysis (PD) and erectile dysfunction with a penile implant placed 6 years prior
      to the admission date presented with complaints of scrotal pain. The pump for his
      implant had eroded through his scrotum and was draining pus. Blood cultures
      returned positive for Gram-positive cocci in clusters in 4/4 bottles, which was
      eventually identified as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). A
      transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed due to concern for infective
      endocarditis (IE) but did not show any valvular abnormalities. Due to high
      clinical suspicion, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed and
      revealed a vegetation on the native mitral valve. His penile implant was removed 
      by urology and intraoperative cultures grew MSSA. Surgical valve replacement was 
      not recommended, and the patient was sent home with IV antibiotics for 6 weeks.
      Discussion: Post-operative site infections are a quite uncommon point of entry
      for infective endocarditis, with penile implant infections being an even rarer
      cause. While a TTE is often used initially to attempt to diagnose infective
      endocarditis, it has lower sensitivity than a TEE. If clinical suspicion for
      infective endocarditis remains high after negative imaging with TTE, then TEE
      should be performed for better visualization of the heart valves.

PG  - 000293
LID - 10.1099/acmi.0.000293 [doi]
AB  - Livestock, particularly pigs, have increasingly been recognized as important
      reservoirs for zoonotic transmission of pathogenic bacteria, including
      staphylococci. Livestock production systems in developing countries of
      sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria, are characterized by high misuse/abuse of 
      antimicrobials and a close association between humans and these animals, which
      promotes the emergence and transmission of resistant and potentially virulent
      bacteria. In the present study, we investigated the occurrence and
      characteristics (species distribution, virulence and resistance profile) of
      staphylococci from smallholder backyard pig farms, slaughter slabs and pig
      handlers in Makurdi, Nigeria. A total of 330 nasal swabs originating from 300
      pigs and 30 in-contact humans were collected and processed. One hundred and
      thirteen samples [34.2 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 29.1-39.6] comprising
      103 (34.3 %; 95 % CI: 29.0-40.0) and 10 (33.3 %; 95 % CI: 17.3-52.8 %) samples
      from pigs and humans, respectively, were positive for staphylococci, yielding 120
      isolates (pigs n=110, humans n=10). The 120 isolates were distributed into 15
      species with Staphylococcus aureus (n=25) followed by Staphylococcus cohnii
      (n=19) and Staphylococcus sciuri (n=14) occurring more frequently. All isolates
      were resistant to beta-lactam (100 %) antibiotics. Resistance to some critical
      antimicrobials, including linezolid (22 %), vancomycin (19.2 %), gentamicin
      (7.5%) and the fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin (75.8 %) and enrofloxacin (66.7 %),
      was also observed. Majority (99.2 %) of the isolates displayed a multidrug
      resistance phenotype with the AMP-C-CIP-E-ENR-FOX-OX-P-S-SXT-TE phenotype being
      predominant. Overall, 70 % of the isolates expressed the methicillin resistance
      phenotype, out of which 20 % (n=17) were MRSA. Resistance to serum bactericidal
      activity and biofilm production were respectively observed in 45 (100 %) and 5
      (11.3 %) of the coagulase-positive staphylococci. Our findings demonstrated the
      occurrence of a high diversity of staphylococci expressing multidrug resistance
      and potentially virulent phenotypes among healthy swine and pig handlers in
      small-scale backyard farms in North-Central Nigeria. These findings underscore
      the potential role of pig production settings in the emergence and dissemination 
      of potentially virulent staphylococci and the importance of the development of
      antimicrobial resistance monitoring systems/implementation of control measures in
      developing countries. Proper hygienic practices and control of indiscriminate use
      and misuse of antibiotics are recommended.

TI  - Bronchoalveolar lavage of ventilator-associated pneumonia patients for antibiotic
      resistance and susceptibility test.
PG  - e472
LID - 10.1002/hsr2.472 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aims: Ventilator-associated pneumonia is highly prevalent
      nosocomial infection among patients under mechanical ventilation. Bronchoalveolar
      lavage (BAL) is effective in identifying the type of pathogen involved and
      determine the course of antibiotic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      prevalence of different pathogens involved in ventilator-associated pneumonia
      (VAP) and associated antibiotic resistance and sensitivity pattern. Methods: In
      this descriptive cross-sectional study, patients admitted to the intensive care
      unit under mechanical ventilation at Shahid Madani Educational and Medical Center
      in Karaj during 2018 and 2020 were included. BAL samples were obtained from the
      patients. Demographic data, duration of hospitalization, duration of mechanical
      ventilation, and antibiotic susceptibility and resistance tests were recorded for
      all the patients. Results: Among 335 patients included in the study, 215 (64.2%) 
      were males. The mean age of the patients was 55.06 +/- 14.90 years. The most
      common pathogens reported were Acinetobacter baumannii (40%), Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa (21.2%), and Staphylococcus aureus (13.4%). The mean age of the
      patients, gender, duration of mechanical ventilation, and duration of
      hospitalization were not associated with the type of pathogen, P > .05,
      respectively. Conclusion: BAL of these patients indicated that various pathogens 
      are responsible for VAP, and can vary from patient to patient. Antibiotic
      resistance and susceptibility pattern of these pathogens vary and therefore is
      important in determining the course of the treatment.

TI  - Dataset of endodontic microorganisms killed at 265 nm wavelength by an
      ultraviolet C light emitting diode in root canals of extracted, instrumented
      teeth.
PG  - 107750
LID - 10.1016/j.dib.2021.107750 [doi]
AB  - Ultraviolet C (UVC) light emitting diode (LED) can kill the endodontic pathogen
      Enterococcus faecalis and has the potential to kill other oral microorganisms
      associated with endodontic infections. This same bacteriocidal device shows great
      promise in the stimulation of periapical healing and pain reduction resulting
      from inflammation in root canals. Previously, we found that 255 nm UVC LED killed
      E. faecalis and induced the production of cellular biomarkers in HEPM cells and
      gingival fibroblasts (Morio et al., 2019). Here, we extend those findings and
      hypothesize that UVC LED at other wavelengths and power levels kill
      microorganisms associated with root canal infections. Units emitting UVC LED at
      265 nm (12 mW), 265 nm (22.5 mW), and 280 nm (8 mW) wavelenths were assembled and
      the energy levels of their emissions were measured. The energy doses in
      millijoules (mJ) were calculated from the power readings of the meter (microW) x 
      time of exposure (seconds). Ex vivo models of root canals were prepared in
      extracted, instrumented, single canal human premolars. Five cultures of
      microorganisms were treated with 265 nm (12 mW), 265 nm (22.5 mW), or 280 nm (8
      mW) UVC LED on discs in laboratory assays and 4 cultures of microorganisms were
      treated with 265 nm (22.5 mW) UVC LED in root canals of extracted, instrumented
      teeth. After UVC LED treatment, all microorganisms were cultivated on
      microbiological media. Colony forming units (CFU) of viable microorganisms
      treated with UVC LED were counted and compared with those of viable
      microorganisms not treated with UVC LED as controls. Tukey's Honestly Significant
      Difference was used to determine statistical significances (0.05). Units emitting
      UVC LED at 265 nm (12 mW), 265 nm (22.5 mW), and 280 nm (8 mW) killed Candida
      albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), E.
      faecalis, and Streptococcus sanguinis after 30-90 seconds of exposure in
      laboratory assays (p < 0.05). Microbial killing differed among treatment times,
      UVC LED wavelengths, power levels of each unit, and specific microorganism. The
      unit emitting UVC LED at 265 nm (22.5 mW) killed C. albicans, S. aureus, MRSA,
      and E. faecalis in 30 s in root canals of extracted, instrumented teeth (p <
      0.05). This dataset can be reused to assess the ability of other wavelengths and 
      power levels to kill microorganisms as well as improve procedures for treating
      endodontic infections and inflammation in root canals.

TI  - The effectiveness of antibiotic cement-coated nails in post-traumatic femoral and
      tibial osteomyelitis - comparative analysis of custom-made versus commercially
      available nails.
PG  - 457-466
LID - 10.5194/jbji-6-457-2021 [doi]
AB  - Background: The first objective of this retrospective study was to assess
      infection control rates in patients with chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis
      (CPTO) of the femur or tibia treated with antibiotic cement-coated nails. The
      second objective was to compare the efficacy of custom-made nails versus
      commercially available antibiotic-coated nails in terms of infection control and 
      need for reoperation. Methods: We reviewed a consecutive series of CPTO patients 
      treated with antibiotic-coated nails who had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. We
      recorded the characteristics of the initial injury, the type of nail used,
      cement-nail debonding, infecting microorganisms, operating time, infection
      control, need for reoperation, and failure rate. We performed a comparative
      analysis between nails manufactured in the operating room (i.e., custom-made) and
      those commercially available. Results: Thirty patients were included. The
      affected bones were the femur ( n = 15 ) and the tibia ( n = 15 ). Twenty-one of 
      the 30 initial injuries were open fractures. Staphylococcus aureus was the most
      frequently isolated microorganism (50%). Sixteen patients were treated with
      custom-made nails and 14 with commercially available antibiotic-coated nails. At 
      the time of extraction, four out of five custom-made antibiotic-coated nails
      experienced cement-bone debonding. Commercial nails were associated with shorter 
      operating times ( p < 0.0001 ). The overall infection control rate was 96.66%.
      Eight (26.66%) patients needed reoperation. There was one failure (3.33%) in the 
      group treated with custom-made antibiotic-coated nails. We did not find
      significant differences between nail types in terms of reoperation, infection
      control, and failure rate. Conclusions: The use of antibiotic cement-coated nails
      proved useful in CPTO treatment. Commercially available nails had significantly
      shorter operating times and did not present cement-bone debonding during removal.
      Our results seem to indicate that both nail types are similar in terms of
      infection control and reoperation rates.

TI  - Hereditary Mucin Deficiency Caused by Biallelic Loss-of-Function of MUC5B.
LID - 10.1164/rccm.202106-1456OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Mucin homeostasis is fundamental to airway health. Upregulation of
      airway mucus glycoprotein MUC5B is observed in diverse common lung diseases and
      represents a potential therapeutic target. In mice, Muc5b is required for
      mucociliary clearance and for controlling inflammation following microbial
      exposure. The consequences of its loss in humans are unclear. OBJECTIVES: The
      goal of this study was to identify and characterize a family with congenital
      absence of MUC5B protein. METHODS: We performed whole-genome sequencing in an
      adult proband with unexplained bronchiectasis, impaired pulmonary function, and
      repeated Staphylococcus aureus infection. Deep phenotyping over a 12-year period 
      included assessments of pulmonary radioaerosol mucociliary clearance. Genotyping 
      with reverse phenotyping was organized for eight family members. Extensive
      experiments, including immunofluorescence staining and mass spectrometry for
      mucins, were performed across accessible sample types. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN
      RESULTS: The proband, and her symptomatic sibling who also had extensive sinus
      disease with nasal polyps, were homozygous for a novel splicing variant in the
      MUC5B gene (NM_002458.2: c.1938+1G>A). MUC5B was absent from saliva, sputum, and 
      nasal samples. Mucociliary clearance was impaired in the proband, and large
      numbers of apoptotic macrophages were present in sputum. Three siblings
      heterozygous for the familial MUC5B variant were asymptomatic but had a shared
      pattern of mild lung function impairments. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital absence of
      MUC5B defines a new category of genetic respiratory disease. The human phenotype 
      is highly concordant with that of the Muc5b-/- murine model. Further study of
      individuals with decreased MUC5B production could provide unique mechanistic
      insights into airway mucus biology. .

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pleural empyema is one of the most serious and life-threatening types
      of infection in children. The aim of this study was to describe the
      microbiological characteristics and outcomes of children with pleural empyema.
      METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of the medical records of 63
      children admitted to a tertiary hospital in China with pleural empyema between
      January 2009 and December 2018. RESULTS: The children had a median age of 1 year 
      (range: 2 months to 16 years) and 33 (52.4%) were female. Bacterial isolates
      included Staphylococcus aureus (n=15, 23.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=10,
      15.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=7, 11.1%), Escherichia coli (n=2, 3.2%),
      Burkholderia cepacia (n=2, 3.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (n=1, 1.6%), Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%), and Streptococcus constellation (n=1, 1.6%). All 15
      Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be resistant to penicillin, and the 
      rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was high (66.7%,10/15).
      Overall, 5 of 10 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to
      penicillin. Each Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate
      showed susceptibility to vancomycin. Ceftazidime was effective against all
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Of the 63 children, 60 improved, no one died.
      CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the leading 
      cause of pleural empyema. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed a high
      percentage of resistance against penicillin while vancomycin provided 100%
      coverage for these pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the third most common
      pathogen mainly detected in those under 3 years old in the summer and have shown 
      to be susceptible to ceftazidime. The prognosis is good after appropriate
      therapy.
