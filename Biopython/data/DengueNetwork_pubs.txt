AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the 1980s, when dengue was reintroduced in Brazil, outbreaks
      and epidemics caused by different arbovirus strains transmitted by vector
      mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti have been an annual occurrence. The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the behavioural change of high school students and teachers
      who participated in an educational intervention for the prevention and vector
      control of arboviral diseases. METHODS: In this school-based intervention, a
      self-reported questionnaire was used in a pre-post intervention methodology to
      assess environmental risk factors, sociodemographic variables and to measure
      attitudes and behaviours. In all, 883 high school students and teachers from the 
      city of Campina Grande, in the state of Paraiba, northeastern Brazil,
      participated. The e-health intervention consisted of a competition between
      schools to comply with preventive actions via content production for social
      networks, and the monitoring was performed over a period of three months through 
      the ZikaMob software developed by the researchers. RESULTS: Out of the 883 survey
      participants, 690 were students ranging in age from 14 to 41 years, with an
      average of 17 +/- 2 years; and 193 were teachers from 22 to 64 years old,
      averaging 38 +/- 9 years. The analysis of the data shows that significant
      differences in most of the target behaviours were apparent after the
      intervention, with an increase of about 10% in the performance of inspection
      actions; a 7% greater separation of recyclables and a 40% increase in the
      screening of windows among students. Students showed lower fear of, and a lower
      self-perception of the risk of, acquiring arboviruses than teachers on average.
      CONCLUSIONS: ZikaMob is an innovative strategy with the potential to be
      replicated in any location that has an internet network and can involve an
      unlimited number of participants.

TI  - Characterization of an Allosteric Pocket in Zika Virus NS2B-NS3 Protease.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01326 [doi]
AB  - The NS2B-NS3 protease from Zika virus (ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro) cleaves the viral
      polyprotein, being essential for its replication and a therapeutic target.
      Inhibitors that target the active site of ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro have been developed,
      but they tend to have unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties due to their highly 
      positive charge. Thus, the characterization of allosteric sites in this protease 
      provides new strategies for inhibitor development. Here, we characterized a new
      allosteric pocket in ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro, analogous to the one previously described 
      for the dengue virus protease. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate the
      presence of cavities around the residue Ala125, sampling protein conformations in
      which they are connected to the active site. This link between the residue Ala125
      and the active site residues was reinforced by correlation network analysis. To
      experimentally verify the existence of this allosteric mechanism, we expressed
      and purified the Ala125Cys mutant of ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro and demonstrated that this 
      variant is inhibited by the thiol-containing chemical probes
      5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and aldrithiol, which do not affect the
      activity of the wild-type protein. Inhibition of the mutant protein is reversed
      by the addition of strong reducing agents, supporting the involvement of Cys125
      in covalent bond formation and enzyme inhibition. Together, our results provide
      experimental evidence for an allosteric pocket in ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro, in the region
      around Ala125, and computational insights on the structural connection between
      this region and the enzyme active site.

TI  - Wolbachia Utilizes lncRNAs to Activate the Anti-Dengue Toll Pathway and Balance
      Reactive Oxygen Species Stress in Aedes aegypti Through a Competitive Endogenous 
      RNA Network.
PG  - 823403
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2021.823403 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), a class of RNA molecules without protein coding
      potential, are more than 200 nucleotides in length and widely present in a
      variety of species. Although increasing progress in regard to the determination
      of lncRNA function has been made in vertebrates, Aedes aegypti lncRNAs were only 
      identified recently and the functions of few lncRNAs have been annotated so far. 
      Herein, the genome-wide alteration of the lncRNA expression profile trigged by
      Wolbachia wAlbB infection was investigated by comparing A. aegypti Aag2 cells and
      W-Aag2 cells infected with Wolbachia wAlbB. Based on lncRNA sequencing, 3035
      differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE lncRNAs) in total were identified upon
      Wolbachia infection, which were further validated by quantitative PCR. The
      constructed co-expression network of DE lncRNAs and mRNAs revealed that
      Wolbachia-induced DE lncRNAs were highly enriched in the oxidative
      phosphorylation pathway via trans-activity, according to the KEGG pathway
      enrichment analyses. In addition, the established competitive endogenous RNA
      (ceRNA) network identifies the DE lncRNAs enriched in cellular oxidant
      detoxification based on GO enrichment analysis. Furthermore, silencing of
      aae-lnc-7598, the significantly up-regulated lncRNA with the highest fold change 
      induced by Wolbachia, caused a significant reduction of antioxidant catalase 1B
      (CAT1B) gene expression as well as the enhancement of mitochondrial reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) production in living cells. These findings indicate that
      Wolbachia manipulates lncRNA to balance intracellular ROS stress and ensure its
      endosymbiosis in host A. aegypti. Notably, the function assay demonstrated that
      aae-lnc-0165 suppressed by Wolbachia could induce expression of the REL1 gene,
      the key regulator of downstream Toll pathway, through the sequence-specific
      binding of aae-miR-980-5p, which contributes to the activation of Toll pathway.
      Moreover, the depletion of aae-lnc-0165 caused the suppression of mitochondrial
      ROS levels in living cells. Our data reveal that Wolbachia activates the
      anti-dengue Toll pathway through a lncRNA-ceRNA pattern. Taken together, our
      finding suggested that Wolbachia utilizes lncRNAs to activate host anti-dengue
      Toll pathway via a ceRNA network. Moreover, Wolbachia employs lncRNAs to ensure
      ROS homeostasis for ROS-based anti-dengue defense through either trans-regulation
      or the ceRNA network. This study identifies novel potential molecular biomarkers 
      for prevention and control of epidemic dengue.

TI  - Myricetin Allosterically Inhibits the Dengue NS2B-NS3 Protease by Disrupting the 
      Active and Locking the Inactive Conformations.
PG  - 2798-2808
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.1c05569 [doi]
AB  - The dengue NS2B-NS3 protease existing in equilibrium between the active and
      inactive forms is essential for virus replication, thus representing a key drug
      target. Here, myricetin, a plant flavonoid, was characterized to noncompetitively
      inhibit the dengue protease. Further NMR study identified the protease residues
      perturbed by binding to myricetin, which were utilized to construct the
      myricetin-protease complexes. Strikingly, in the active form, myricetin binds to 
      a new allosteric site (AS2) far away from the active site pocket and the
      allosteric site (AS1) for binding curcumin, while in the inactive form, it binds 
      to both AS1 and AS2. To decipher the mechanism for the allosteric inhibition by
      myricetin, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations on different forms of
      dengue NS2B-NS3 proteases. Unexpectedly, the binding of myricetin to AS2 is
      sufficient to disrupt the active conformation by displacing the characteristic
      NS2B C-terminal beta-hairpin from the active site pocket. By contrast, the
      binding of myricetin to AS1 and AS2 results in locking the inactive conformation.
      Therefore, myricetin represents the first small molecule, which allosterically
      inhibits the dengue protease by both disrupting the active conformation and
      locking the inactive conformation. The results enforce the notion that a global
      allosteric network exists in the dengue NS2B-NS3 protease, which is susceptible
      to allosteric inhibition by small molecules such as myricetin and curcumin. As
      myricetin has been extensively used as a food additive, it might be directly
      utilized to fight the dengue infections and as a promising starting material for 
      further design of potent allosteric inhibitors.

      Dengue and Zika in the Dominican Republic.

LID - 10.3390/v14010162 [doi]
AB  - Arboviruses remain a significant cause of morbidity, mortality and economic cost 
      across the global human population. Epidemics of arboviral disease, such as Zika 
      and dengue, also cause significant disruption to health services at local and
      national levels. This study examined 2014-2016 Zika and dengue epidemic data at
      the sub-national level to characterise transmission across the Dominican
      Republic. For each municipality, spatio-temporal mapping was used to characterise
      disease burden, while data were age and sex standardised to quantify burden
      distributions among the population. In separate analyses, time-ordered data were 
      combined with the underlying disease migration interval distribution to produce a
      network of likely transmission chain events, displayed using transmission chain
      likelihood matrices. Finally, municipal-specific reproduction numbers (Rm) were
      established using a Wallinga-Teunis matrix. Dengue and Zika epidemics peaked
      during weeks 39-52 of 2015 and weeks 14-27 of 2016, respectively. At the
      provincial level, dengue attack rates were high in Hermanas Mirabal and San Jose 
      de Ocoa (58.1 and 49.2 cases per 10,000 population, respectively), compared with 
      the Zika burden, which was highest in Independencia and San Jose de Ocoa (21.2
      and 13.4 cases per 10,000 population, respectively). Across municipalities, high 
      disease burden was observed in Cotui (622 dengue cases per 10,000 population) and
      Jimani (32 Zika cases per 10,000 population). Municipal infector-infectee
      transmission likelihood matrices identified seven 0% likelihood transmission
      events throughout the dengue epidemic and two 0% likelihood transmission events
      during the Zika epidemic. Municipality reproduction numbers (Rm) were
      consistently higher, and persisted for a greater duration, during the Zika
      epidemic (Rm = 1.0) than during the dengue epidemic (Rm < 1.0). This research
      highlights the importance of disease surveillance in land border municipalities
      as an early warning for infectious disease transmission. It also demonstrates
      that a high number of importation events are required to sustain transmission in 
      endemic settings, and vice versa for newly emerged diseases. The inception of a
      novel epidemiological metric, Rm, reports transmission risk using standardised
      spatial units, and can be used to identify high transmission risk municipalities 
      to better focus public health interventions for dengue, Zika and other infectious
      diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging infectious diseases pose an increasing threat to all nations
      around the world, including to developed countries. By definition, because they
      are rare or unknown, public health systems are not well prepared against these
      emerging diseases. To be fully prepared, countries must have implemented
      surveillance systems to monitor rare or unusual sanitary events. METHODS: The
      capacity of diagnostic laboratories is a key component of surveillance systems
      since they are in charge of identifying the pathogens responsible for outbreaks
      in a timely manner. The MediLabSecure project aims at implementing a
      comprehensive surveillance system for vector-borne diseases around the
      Mediterranean and Black Sea regions. From 2014 to 2018, the human-virology group 
      of MediLabSecure notably supported the implementation of molecular diagnostic
      capacities for eight arboviruses and one coronavirus in 19 laboratories of its
      network through sharing of protocols and reagents, and technical training of the 
      scientific staff of beneficiary laboratories. RESULTS: We report the results of
      External Quality Assessments for four of these viruses to assess the efficiency
      of the diagnostic for these threats emerging in the geographic area. The results 
      for these EQA demonstrate the success of the project in the implementation of
      diagnostic technics for the identification of Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, and West
      Niles viruses in laboratories that did not have the capacity before. However,
      results also show that some work is still to be done to strengthen the newly
      acquired capacity. CONCLUSION: The MediLabSecure project deployed an effort to
      build an efficient capacity in identifying and survey the emergence of
      arboviruses in the Mediterranean area. Diagnostic technics were successfully
      implemented in many of the laboratories of the network, but the effort must be
      maintained over time to strengthen these capacities.

TI  - Network science inspires novel tree shape statistics.
PG  - e0259877
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0259877 [doi]
AB  - The shape of phylogenetic trees can be used to gain evolutionary insights. A
      tree's shape specifies the connectivity of a tree, while its branch lengths
      reflect either the time or genetic distance between branching events; well-known 
      measures of tree shape include the Colless and Sackin imbalance, which describe
      the asymmetry of a tree. In other contexts, network science has become an
      important paradigm for describing structural features of networks and using them 
      to understand complex systems, ranging from protein interactions to social
      systems. Network science is thus a potential source of many novel ways to
      characterize tree shape, as trees are also networks. Here, we tailor tools from
      network science, including diameter, average path length, and betweenness,
      closeness, and eigenvector centrality, to summarize phylogenetic tree shapes. We 
      thereby propose tree shape summaries that are complementary to both asymmetry and
      the frequencies of small configurations. These new statistics can be computed in 
      linear time and scale well to describe the shapes of large trees. We apply these 
      statistics, alongside some conventional tree statistics, to phylogenetic trees
      from three very different viruses (HIV, dengue fever and measles), from the same 
      virus in different epidemiological scenarios (influenza A and HIV) and from
      simulation models known to produce trees with different shapes. Using mutual
      information and supervised learning algorithms, we find that the statistics
      adapted from network science perform as well as or better than conventional
      statistics. We describe their distributions and prove some basic results about
      their extreme values in a tree. We conclude that network science-based tree shape
      summaries are a promising addition to the toolkit of tree shape features. All our
      shape summaries, as well as functions to select the most discriminating ones for 
      two sets of trees, are freely available as an R package at
      http://github.com/Leonardini/treeCentrality.

TI  - Mapping the spatial distribution of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and
      predicting its abundance in northeastern Thailand using machine-learning
      approach.
PG  - 100358
LID - 10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.100358 [doi]
AB  - Background: Mapping the spatial distribution of the dengue vector Aedes (Ae.)
      aegypti and accurately predicting its abundance are crucial for designing
      effective vector control strategies and early warning tools for dengue epidemic
      prevention. Socio-ecological and landscape factors influence Ae. aegypti
      abundance. Therefore, we aimed to map the spatial distribution of female adult
      Ae. aegypti and predict its abundance in northeastern Thailand based on
      socioeconomic, climate change, and dengue knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP)
      and/or landscape factors using machine learning (ML)-based system. Method: A
      total of 1066 females adult Ae. aegypti were collected from four villages in
      northeastern Thailand during January-December 2019. Information on household
      socioeconomics, KAP regarding climate change and dengue, and satellite-based
      landscape data were also acquired. Geographic information systems (GIS) were used
      to map the household-based spatial distribution of female adult Ae. aegypti
      abundance (high/low). Five popular supervised learning models, logistic
      regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN),
      artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF), were used to predict
      females adult Ae. aegypti abundance (high/low). The predictive accuracy of each
      modeling technique was calculated and evaluated. Important variables for
      predicting female adult Ae. aegypti abundance were also identified using the
      best-fitted model. Results: Urban areas had higher abundance of female adult Ae. 
      aegypti compared to rural areas. Overall, study respondents in both urban and
      rural areas had inadequate KAP regarding climate change and dengue. The average
      landscape factors per household in urban areas were rice crop (47.4%), natural
      tree cover (17.8%), built-up area (13.2%), permanent wetlands (21.2%), and rubber
      plantation (0%), and the corresponding figures for rural areas were 12.1, 2.0,
      38.7, 40.1 and 0.1% respectively. Among all assessed models, RF showed the best
      prediction performance (socioeconomics: area under curve, AUC = 0.93,
      classification accuracy, CA = 0.86, F1 score = 0.85; KAP: AUC = 0.95, CA = 0.92, 
      F1 = 0.90; landscape: AUC = 0.96, CA = 0.89, F1 = 0.87) for female adult Ae.
      aegypti abundance. The combined influences of all factors further improved the
      predictive accuracy in RF model (socioeconomics + KAP + landscape: AUC = 0.99, CA
      = 0.96 and F1 = 0.95). Dengue prevention practices were shown to be the most
      important predictor in the RF model for female adult Ae. aegypti abundance in
      northeastern Thailand. Conclusion: The RF model is more suitable for the
      prediction of Ae. aegypti abundance in northeastern Thailand. Our study
      exemplifies that the application of GIS and machine learning systems has
      significant potential for understanding the spatial distribution of dengue
      vectors and predicting its abundance. The study findings might help optimize
      vector control strategies, future mosquito suppression, prediction and control
      strategies of epidemic arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, and Zika). Such
      strategies can be incorporated into One Health approaches applying
      transdisciplinary approaches considering human-vector and agro-environmental
      interrelationships.

TI  - The epidemiological characteristics of dengue in high-risk areas of China,
      2013-2016.
PG  - e0009970
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009970 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dengue has become a more serious human health concern in China,
      with increased incidence and expanded outbreak regions. The knowledge of the
      cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiological characteristics and the
      evolutionary dynamics of dengue in high-risk areas of China is limited. METHODS: 
      Records of dengue cases from 2013 to 2016 were obtained from the China Notifiable
      Disease Surveillance System. Full envelope gene sequences of dengue viruses
      detected from the high-risk areas of China were collected. Maximum Likelihood
      tree and haplotype network analyses were conducted to explore the phylogenetic
      relationship of viruses from high-risk areas of China. RESULTS: A total of 56,520
      cases was reported in China from 2013 to 2016. During this time, Yunnan,
      Guangdong and Fujian provinces were the high-risk areas. Imported cases occurred 
      almost year-round, and were mainly introduced from Southeast Asia. The first
      indigenous case usually occurred in June to August, and the last one occurred
      before December in Yunnan and Fujian provinces but in December in Guangdong
      Province. Seven genotypes of DENV 1-3 were detected in the high-risk areas, with 
      DENV 1-I the main genotype and DENV 2-Cosmopolitan the secondary one. The Maximum
      Likelihood trees show that almost all the indigenous viruses separated into
      different clusters. DENV 1-I viruses were found to be clustered in Guangdong
      Province, but not in Fujian and Yunnan, from 2013 to 2015. The ancestors of the
      Guangdong viruses in the cluster in 2013 and 2014 were most closely related to
      strains from Thailand or Singapore, and the Guangdong virus in 2015 was most
      closely related to the Guangdong virus of 2014. Based on closest phylogenetic
      relationships, viruses from Myanmar possibly initiated further indigenous cases
      in Yunnan, those from Indonesia in Fujian, while viruses from Thailand, Malaysia,
      Singapore and Indonesia were predominant in Guangdong Province. CONCLUSIONS:
      Dengue is still an imported disease in China, although some genotypes continued
      to circulate in successive years. Viral phylogenies based on the envelope gene
      suggested periodic introductions of dengue strains into China, primarily from

AB  - Dengue is hyperendemic in Brazil, with outbreaks affecting all regions. Previous 
      studies identified geographical barriers to dengue transmission in Brazil, beyond
      which certain areas, such as South Brazil and the Amazon rainforest, were
      relatively protected from outbreaks. Recent data shows these barriers are being
      eroded. In this study, we explore the drivers of this expansion and identify the 
      current limits to the dengue transmission zone. We used a spatio-temporal
      additive model to explore the associations between dengue outbreaks and
      temperature suitability, urbanisation, and connectivity to the Brazilian urban
      network. The model was applied to a binary outbreak indicator, assuming the
      official threshold value of 300 cases per 100,000 residents, for Brazil's
      municipalities between 2001 and 2020. We found a nonlinear relationship between
      higher levels of connectivity to the Brazilian urban network and the odds of an
      outbreak, with lower odds in metropoles compared to regional capitals. The number
      of months per year with suitable temperature conditions for Aedes mosquitoes was 
      positively associated with the dengue outbreak occurrence. Temperature
      suitability explained most interannual and spatial variation in South Brazil,
      confirming this geographical barrier is influenced by lower seasonal
      temperatures. Municipalities that had experienced an outbreak previously had
      double the odds of subsequent outbreaks. We identified geographical barriers to
      dengue transmission in South Brazil, western Amazon, and along the northern coast
      of Brazil. Although a southern barrier still exists, it has shifted south, and
      the Amazon no longer has a clear boundary. Few areas of Brazil remain protected
      from dengue outbreaks. Communities living on the edge of previous barriers are
      particularly susceptible to future outbreaks as they lack immunity. Control
      strategies should target regions at risk of future outbreaks as well as those
      currently within the dengue transmission zone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is considered to be the most important arbovirus worldwide,
      with important complications that increase its lethality. In Brazil, an endemic
      country, the disease reaches significant incidence levels, with occurrences of
      serious cases and high costs of hospitalizations for its treatment. OBJECTIVE: To
      analyze risk factors among individuals with recent histories of dengue infection 
      in a medium-sized city in Mato Grosso. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive
      cross-sectional study, of epidemiological-survey type, conducted among the urban 
      population of a city located in mid-northern Mato Grosso. METHODS: A
      seroepidemiological survey using questionnaires and collection of biological
      material was conducted among 596 adults aged >/= 18 years who had been selected
      through a cluster sampling process. Positive dengue cases were those with
      positive results from anti-dengue immunoassays (ELISA). Statistical analyses with
      descriptive and inferential techniques were used, with 95% confidence intervals
      and a 5% significance level. RESULTS: The seroepidemiological profile of the
      study participants was predominantly female, with ages between 18 and 39 years,
      self-declared non-white race/color, not more than eight years of education and
      not living with a companion. Among the sanitary factors analyzed, the following
      were risk factors for dengue virus infection: no running water at home; no water 
      supply from the public piped network; no waste from drains or toilets sent to the
      sewage network; endemic disease combat agents visiting the home; and presence of 
      mosquito breeding sites at home. CONCLUSION: Low schooling levels and previous
      dengue virus infection were associated with current dengue virus infection.

TI  - Alkyne-Tagged Apigenin, a Chemical Tool to Navigate Potential Targets of
      Flavonoid Anti-Dengue Leads.
LID - 6967 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules26226967 [doi]
AB  - A flavonoid is a versatile core structure with various cellular, immunological,
      and pharmacological effects. Recently, flavones have shown anti-dengue activities
      by interfering with viral translation and replication. However, the molecular
      target is still elusive. Here we chemically modified apigenin by adding an alkyne
      moiety into the B-ring hydroxyl group. The alkyne serves as a chemical tag for
      the alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction for subcellular visualization. The
      compound located at the perinuclear region at 1 and 6 h after infection.
      Interestingly, the compound signal started shifting to vesicle-like structures at
      6 h and accumulated at 24 and 48 h after infection. Moreover, the compound
      treatment in dengue-infected cells showed that the compound restricted the viral 
      protein inside the vesicles, especially at 48 h. As a result, the dengue envelope
      proteins spread throughout the cells. The alkyne-tagged apigenin showed a more
      potent efficacy at the EC50 of 2.36 +/- 0.22, and 10.55 +/- 3.37 microM,
      respectively, while the cytotoxicities were similar to the original apigenin at
      the CC50 of 70.34 +/- 11.79, and 82.82 +/- 11.68 microM, respectively. Molecular 
      docking confirmed the apigenin binding to the previously reported target,
      ribosomal protein S9, at two binding sites. The network analysis, homopharma, and
      molecular docking revealed that the estrogen receptor 1 and viral NS1 were
      potential targets at the late infection stage. The interactions could attenuate
      dengue productivity by interfering with viral translation and suppressing the
      viral proteins from trafficking to the cell surface.

TI  - Diterpenes/Diterpenoids and Their Derivatives as Potential Bioactive Leads
      against Dengue Virus: A Computational and Network Pharmacology Study.
LID - 6821 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules26226821 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever is a dangerous infectious endemic disease that affects over 100
      nations worldwide, from Africa to the Western Pacific, and is caused by the
      dengue virus, which is transmitted to humans by an insect bite of Aedes aegypti. 
      Millions of citizens have died as a result of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic
      fever across the globe. Envelope (E), serine protease (NS3), RNA-directed RNA
      polymerase (NS5), and non-structural protein 1 (NS1) are mostly required for cell
      proliferation and survival. Some of the diterpenoids and their derivatives
      produced by nature possess anti-dengue viral properties. The goal of the
      computational study was to scrutinize the effectiveness of diterpenoids and their
      derivatives against dengue viral proteins through in silico study. Methods:
      molecular docking was performed to analyze the binding affinity of compounds
      against four viral proteins: the envelope (E) protein, the NS1 protein, the NS3
      protein, and the NS5 protein. Results: among the selected drug candidates,
      triptolide, stevioside, alepterolic acid, sphaeropsidin A, methyl dodovisate A,
      andrographolide, caesalacetal, and pyrimethamine have demonstrated moderate to
      good binding affinities (-8.0 to -9.4 kcal/mol) toward the selected proteins: E
      protein, NS3, NS5, and NS1 whereas pyrimethamine exerts -7.5, -6.3, -7.8, and
      -6.6 kcal/mol with viral proteins, respectively. Interestingly, the binding
      affinities of these lead compounds were better than those of an FDA-approved
      anti-viral medication (pyrimethamine), which is underused in dengue fever.
      Conclusion: we can conclude that diterpenoids can be considered as a possible
      anti-dengue medication option. However, in vivo investigation is recommended to
      back up the conclusions of this study.

TI  - Assessing the Effect of Climate Variables on the Incidence of Dengue Cases in the
      Metropolitan Region of Panama City.
LID - 12108 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182212108 [doi]
AB  - The present analysis uses the data of confirmed incidence of dengue cases in the 
      metropolitan region of Panama from 1999 to 2017 and climatic variables (air
      temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity) during the same period to
      determine if there exists a correlation between these variables. In addition, we 
      compare the predictive performance of two regression models (SARIMA, SARIMAX) and
      a recurrent neural network model (RNN-LSTM) on the dengue incidence series. For
      this data from 1999-2014 was used for training and the three subsequent years of 
      incidence 2015-2017 were used for prediction. The results show a correlation
      coefficient between the climatic variables and the incidence of dengue were low
      but statistical significant. The RMSE and MAPE obtained for the SARIMAX and
      RNN-LSTM models were 25.76, 108.44 and 26.16, 59.68, which suggest that any of
      these models can be used to predict new outbreaks. Although, it can be said that 
      there is a limited role of climatic variables in the outputs the models. The
      value of this work is that it helps understand the behaviour of cases in a
      tropical setting as is the Metropolitan Region of Panama City, and provides the
      basis needed for a much needed early alert system for the region.

TI  - Wolbachia detection in Aedes aegypti using MALDI-TOF MS coupled to artificial
      intelligence.
PG  - 21355
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-00888-1 [doi]
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the major vector of arboviruses like dengue, Zika
      and chikungunya viruses. Attempts to reduce arboviruses emergence focusing on Ae.
      aegypti control has proven challenging due to the increase of insecticide
      resistances. An emerging strategy which consists of releasing Ae. aegypti
      artificially infected with Wolbachia in natural mosquito populations is currently
      being developed. The monitoring of Wolbachia-positive Ae. aegypti in the field is
      performed in order to ensure the program effectiveness. Here, the reliability of 
      the MatrixAssisted Laser Desorption IonizationTime Of Flight (MALDITOF) coupled
      with the machine learning methods like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
      detect Wolbachia in field Ae. aegypti was assessed for the first time. For this
      purpose, laboratory reared and field Ae. aegypti were analyzed. The results
      showed that the CNN recognized Ae. aegypti spectral patterns associated with
      Wolbachia-infection. The MALDI-TOF coupled with the CNN (sensitivity = 93%,
      specificity = 99%, accuracy = 97%) was more efficient than the loop-mediated
      isothermal amplification (LAMP), and as efficient as qPCR for Wolbachia
      detection. It therefore represents an interesting method to evaluate the
      prevalence of Wolbachia in field Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.

TI  - Expansive and Diverse Phenotypic Landscape of Field Aedes aegypti (Diptera:
      Culicidae) Larvae with Differential Susceptibility to Temephos: Beyond Metabolic 
      Detoxification.
PG  - 192-212
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjab179 [doi]
AB  - Arboviruses including dengue, Zika, and chikungunya are amongst the most
      significant public health concerns worldwide. Arbovirus control relies on the use
      of insecticides to control the vector mosquito Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus), the
      success of which is threatened by widespread insecticide resistance. The work
      presented here profiled the gene expression of Ae. aegypti larvae from field
      populations of Ae. aegypti with differential susceptibility to temephos
      originating from two Colombian urban locations, Bello and Cucuta, previously
      reported to have distinctive disease incidence, socioeconomics, and climate. We
      demonstrated that an exclusive field-to-lab (Ae. aegypti strain New Orleans)
      comparison generates an over estimation of differential gene expression (DGE) and
      that the inclusion of a geographically relevant field control yields a more
      discrete, and likely, more specific set of genes. The composition of the obtained
      DGE profiles is varied, with commonly reported resistance associated genes
      including detoxifying enzymes having only a small representation. We identify
      cuticle biosynthesis, ion exchange homeostasis, an extensive number of long
      noncoding RNAs, and chromatin modelling among the differentially expressed genes 
      in field resistant Ae. aegypti larvae. It was also shown that temephos resistant 
      larvae undertake further gene expression responses when temporarily exposed to
      temephos. The results from the sampling triangulation approach here contribute a 
      discrete DGE profiling with reduced noise that permitted the observation of a
      greater gene diversity, increasing the number of potential targets for the
      control of insecticide resistant mosquitoes and widening our knowledge base on
      the complex phenotypic network of the Ae. aegypti response to insecticides.

AB  - Dengue infection is a global threat. As of today, there is no universal dengue
      fever treatment or vaccines unreservedly recommended by the World Health
      Organization. The investigation of the specific immune response to dengue virus
      would support antibody discovery as therapeutics for passive immunization and
      vaccine design. High-throughput sequencing enables the identification of the
      multitude of antibodies elicited in response to dengue infection at the sequence 
      level. Artificial intelligence can mine the complex data generated and has the
      potential to uncover patterns in entire antibody repertoires and detect
      signatures distinctive of single virus-binding antibodies. However, these machine
      learning have not been harnessed to determine the immune response to dengue
      virus. In order to enable the application of machine learning, we have
      benchmarked existing methods for encoding biological and chemical knowledge as
      inputs and have investigated novel encoding techniques. We have applied different
      machine learning methods such as neural networks, random forests, and support
      vector machines and have investigated the parameter space to determine best
      performing algorithms for the detection and prediction of antibody patterns at
      the repertoire and antibody sequence levels in dengue-infected individuals. Our
      results show that immune response signatures to dengue are detectable both at the
      antibody repertoire and at the antibody sequence levels. By combining machine
      learning with phylogenies and network analysis, we generated novel sequences that
      present dengue-binding specific signatures. These results might aid further
      antibody discovery and support vaccine design.

AB  - Rubella and congenital rubella syndrome are caused by the rubella virus and are
      preventable through vaccination, making disease eradication possible. Monitoring 
      of progress toward global eradication and local elimination requires
      high-quality, sensitive disease surveillance that includes laboratory
      confirmation of cases. Previous evaluations of anti-rubella IgM detection methods
      resulted in the broad adoption of the Enzygnost (most recently manufactured by
      Siemens) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits within WHO's global
      measles and rubella laboratory network, but they have been discontinued. This
      study evaluated seven comparable ELISAs from six manufacturers (Trinity Biotech, 
      Euroimmun, Clin-Tech, NovaTec and Virion\Serion) as well as one automated
      chemiluminescent assay (CLIA) from DiaSorin. These assays include three IgM
      capture assays and five indirect ELISAs. A panel of 238 sera was used for the
      evaluation that included 38 archival rubella IgM-positive sera and 200 sera
      collected from patients with symptomatically similar diseases, such as measles,
      dengue, parvovirus B19 infection, and roseola. With this panel of sera, the
      sensitivity of the methods ranged from 63.2% to 100% and the specificity from
      80.0% to 99.5%. No single method had both sensitivity and specificity of >90%,
      unless sera with equivocal results were considered presumptively positive. Some
      assays, particularly the Serion ELISA, had a large number of false positives with
      parvovirus B19 IgM-positive sera as well as sera from confirmed measles cases.
      The performance characteristics identified in this evaluation serve as a reminder
      to not rely solely on rubella IgM results for case confirmation in elimination
      settings.

AB  - Dengue virus infection mainly causes dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and/or dengue
      shock syndrome (DSS). However, ADE (antibody-dependent enhancement) is one of the
      main pathogenic factors, and its pathogenic mechanism has not been fully
      elucidated. Recently, with the development of high-throughput sequencing, an
      increased number of RNAs have been confirmed to play a vital regulatory role in
      the process of virus infection. However, there is a lack of research on dengue
      virus infection and ADE. In this study, we used RNA-Seq to detect differentially 
      expressed RNAs (DE RNAs) profiles in mock-infected, DENV-3-infected, and
      ADE-infected THP-1 cells. Firstly, we found 69 circRNAs, 259 miRNAs, and 18 mRNAs
      were differentially expressed in THP-1 vs DENV-3. In THP-1 vs ADE, 94 circRNAs,
      263 miRNAs, and 111 mRNAs were differentially expressed. In DENV-3 vs ADE, 68
      circRNAs, 105 miRNAs, and 94 mRNAs were differentially expressed. Functional
      enrichment analysis of these DE RNAs mainly focused on immune system, viral
      infectious diseases, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and NOD/RIG-I-like 
      receptor signaling pathways. In DENV-3 vs ADE, notably, the expression of HBB was
      up-regulated, which was a Fcgamma Receptor-mediated phagocytosis protein.
      Additionally, we predicted the encoding ability of DE circRNAs, and it was found 
      that a small peptide was encoded by novel_circ_001562 and that its amino acid
      sequence was consistent with that of DDX60L, which is a class of
      interferon-stimulated genes. Finally, we constructed the ceRNA regulatory network
      pathway. Therefore, our study provides a new strategy for further investigation
      on DENV-host interactions.

AB  - Transient receptor potential mucolipin 2 and 3 (TRPML2 and TRPML3), as key
      channels in the endosomal-lysosomal system, are associated with many different
      cellular processes, including ion release, membrane trafficking and autophagy. In
      particular, they can also facilitate viral entry into host cells and enhance
      viral infection. We previously identified that two selective TRPML agonists,
      ML-SA1 and SN-2, that showed antiviral activities against dengue virus type 2
      (DENV2) and Zika virus (ZIKV) in vitro, but their antiviral mechanisms are still 
      elusive. Here, we reported that ML-SA1 could inhibit DENV2 replication by
      downregulating the expression of both TRPML2 and TRPML3, while the other TRPML
      activator, SN-2, suppressed DENV2 infection by reducing only TRPML3 expression.
      Consistently, the channel activities of both TRPML2 and TRPML3 were also found to
      be associated with the antiviral activity of ML-SA1 on DENV2 and ZIKV, but SN-2
      relied only on TRPML3 channel activity. Further mechanistic experiments revealed 
      that ML-SA1 and SN-2 decreased the expression of the late endosomal marker Rab7, 
      dependent on TRPML2 and TRPML3, indicating that these two compounds likely
      inhibit viral infection by promoting vesicular trafficking from late endosomes to
      lysosomes and then accelerating lysosomal degradation of the virus. As expected, 
      neither ML-SA1 nor SN-2 inhibited herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1), whose
      entry is independent of the endolysosomal network. Together, our work reveals the
      antiviral mechanisms of ML-SA1 and SN-2 in targeting TRPML channels, possibly
      leading to the discovery of new drug candidates to inhibit endocytosed viruses.

      in Brazil.
LID - e007131 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/bmjgh-2021-007131 [doi]
AB  - The '2019 Research Capacity Network (REDe) workshop series' was an initiative led
      by Brazil-based REDe coordinators and The Global Health Network (TGHN) in
      partnership with Brazilian researchers interested in arboviruses. This workshop
      initiative has provided crucial training to the local research community offering
      transferable skills to effectively respond to health emergencies, with an impact 
      beyond arboviral diseases, as evidenced by further activities undertaken during
      the COVID-19 pandemic. The success of this approach resulted from several
      factors, especially the workshops' local leadership and the combination of
      in-person training with online sharing of the resources generated in the local
      language. Analytics data from REDe online platform evidenced the wider reach of
      the shared resources to a larger audience than the workshop attendees.
      Importantly, the impact of this approach extends beyond the workshop series per
      se, with workshop participants afforded access to wider training, career
      development and collaborative opportunities through REDe and TGHN platforms. In
      addition, this initiative design resulted in the development of new
      collaborations between the workshop leaders and other local researchers, who have
      been jointly writing research projects and applying for grants. As a result, REDe
      has become a highly dynamic community of practice for health researchers in the
      region, strengthening the research culture and improving connectivity. Here, we
      describe the design and implementation of this initiative and demonstrate the
      value of integrating local expertise, and a practical workshop series format with
      digital dissemination of research resources and training materials to generate a 
      vibrant and robust community of practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disease surveillance and response are critical components of epidemic
      preparedness. The disease response, in most cases, is a set of reactive measures 
      that follow the outcomes of the disease surveillance. Hence, timely surveillance 
      is a prerequisite for an effective response. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We
      apply epidemiological soundness criteria in combination with the Latent Influence
      Point Process and time-to-event models to construct a disease spread network. The
      network implicitly quantifies the fertility (whether a case leads to secondary
      cases) and reproduction (number of secondary cases per infectious case) of the
      cases as well as the size and generations (of the infection chain) of the
      outbreaks. We test our approach by applying it to historic dengue case data from 
      Australia. Using the data, we empirically confirm that high morbidity relates
      positively with delay in disease response. Moreover, we identify what constitutes
      timely surveillance by applying various thresholds of disease response delay to
      the network and report their impact on case fertility, reproduction, number of
      generations and ultimately, outbreak size. We observe that enforcing a response
      delay threshold of 5 days leads to a large average reduction across all
      parameters (occurrence 87%, reproduction 83%, outbreak size 80% and outbreak
      generations 47%), whereas extending the threshold to 10 days, in comparison,
      significantly limits the effectiveness of the response actions. Lastly, we
      identify the components of the disease surveillance system that can be calibrated
      to achieve the identified thresholds. CONCLUSION: We identify practically
      achievable, timely surveillance thresholds (on temporal scale) that lead to an
      effective response and identify how they can be satisfied. Our approach can be
      utilized to provide guidelines on spatially and demographically targeted resource
      allocation for public awareness campaigns as well as to improve diagnostic
      abilities and turn-around times for the doctors and laboratories involved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nicaragua experienced a large Zika epidemic in 2016, with up to 50%
      of the population in Managua infected. With the domesticated Aedes aegypti
      mosquito as its vector, it is widely assumed that Zika virus transmission occurs 
      within the household and/or via human mobility. We investigated these assumptions
      by using viral genomes to trace Zika transmission spatially. METHODS: We analysed
      serum samples from 119 paediatric Zika cases participating in the long-standing
      Paediatric Dengue Cohort Study in Managua, which was expanded to include Zika in 
      2015. An optimal spanning directed tree was constructed by minimizing the
      differences in viral sequence diversity composition between patient nodes, where 
      low-frequency variants were used to increase the resolution of the inferred Zika 
      outbreak dynamics. FINDINGS: Out of the 18 houses where pairwise difference in
      sample collection dates among all the household members was within 30 days, we
      only found two where viruses from individuals within the same household were up
      to 10(th)-most closely linked to each other genetically. We also identified a
      substantial number of transmission events involving long geographical distances
      (n=30), as well as potential super-spreading events in the estimated transmission
      tree. INTERPRETATION: Our finding highlights that community transmission, often
      involving long geographical distances, played a much more important role in
      epidemic spread than within-household transmission. FUNDING: This study was
      supported by an NUS startup grant (OMS) and grants R01 AI099631 (AB), P01
      AI106695 (EH), P01 AI106695-03S1 (FB), and U19 AI118610 (EH) from the US National

LID - 10.1093/femspd/ftab046 [doi]
AB  - Mosquito-borne viral diseases like chikungunya and dengue infections can cause
      severe illness and have become major public health concerns. Chikungunya virus
      (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) infections share similar primary clinical
      manifestations and are transmitted by the same vector. Thus, the probability of
      their coinfection gets increased with more severe clinical complications in the
      patients. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the common human
      interacting partners of CHIKV and DENV proteins during coinfection. The
      viral-host protein-protein interactome was constructed using Cytoscape.
      Subsequently, significant host interactors were identified during coinfection.
      The network analysis elucidated 57 human proteins interacting with both CHIKV and
      DENV, represented as hub-bottlenecks. The functional and biological analyses of
      the 40 hub-bottlenecks revealed that they are associated with phosphoinositide
      3-kinases (PI3K)/AKT, p53 signaling pathways, regulation of cell cycle and
      apoptosis during coinfection. Moreover, the molecular docking analysis uncovered 
      the tight and robust binding of selected hub-bottlenecks with CHIKV/DENV
      proteins. Additionally, 23 hub-bottlenecks were predicted as druggable candidates
      that could be targeted to eradicate the host-viral interactions. The elucidated
      common host binding partners during DENV and CHIKV coinfection as well as
      indicated approved drugs can support the therapeutics development.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a small envelope virus of Flaviviridae that is mainly
      transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. It can cause dengue fever with
      mild clinical symptoms or even life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)
      and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). At present, there are no specific drugs or
      mature vaccine products to treat DENV. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of
      important non-coding small molecular RNAs that regulate gene expression at the
      post-transcriptional level. It is involved in and regulates a series of important
      life processes, such as growth and development, cell differentiation, cell
      apoptosis, anti-virus, and anti-tumor. miRNAs also play important roles in
      interactions between host and viral genome transcriptomes. Host miRNAs can
      directly target the genome of the virus or regulate host factors to promote or
      inhibit virus replication. Understanding the expression and function of miRNAs
      during infection with DENV and the related signal molecules of the miRNA-mediated
      regulatory network will provide new insights for the development of miRNA-based
      therapies.

TI  - Simulating an invasion: unsealed water storage (rainwater tanks) and urban block 
      design facilitate the spread of the dengue fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, in
      Brisbane, Australia.
PG  - 1-16

AB  - Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) was once highly prevalent across eastern Australia,
      resulting in epidemics of dengue fever. Drought conditions have led to a rapid
      rise in semi-permanent, urban water storage containers called rainwater tanks
      known to be critical larval habitat for the species. The presence of these larval
      habitats has increased the risk of establishment of highly urbanised, invasive
      mosquito vectors such as Ae. aegypti. Here we use a spatially explicit network
      model to examine the role that unsealed rainwater tanks may play in population
      connectivity of an Ae. aegypti invasion in suburbs of Brisbane, a major
      Australian city. We characterise movement between rainwater tanks as a
      diffusion-like process, limited by a maximum distance of movement, average life
      expectancy, and a probability that Ae. aegypti will cross wide open spaces such
      as roads. The simulation model was run against a number of scenarios that
      examined population spread through the rainwater tank network based on
      non-compliance rates of tanks (unsealed or sealed) and road grids. We show that
      Ae. aegypti tank infestation and population spread was greatest in areas of high 
      tank density and road lengths were shortest e.g. cul-de-sacs. Rainwater tank
      non-compliance rates of over 30% show increased connectivity when compared to
      less than 10%, suggesting rainwater tanks non-compliance should be maintained
      under this level to minimize the spread of an invading Ae. aegypti population.
      These results presented as risk maps of Ae. aegypti spread across Brisbane, can
      assist health and government authorities on where to optimally target rainwater
      tank surveillance and educational activities. Supplementary Information: The

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A retrospective study was undertaken to investigate the circulating
      dengue virus (DENV) serotypes and genotypes in India in 2018. METHODS: In total, 
      4963 samples referred to virus research diagnostic laboratories (n=21), the
      Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) and 
      ICMR-NIV field units (n=2) for diagnosis of dengue in 2018 were tested using a
      real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for the presence 
      of DENV serotypes. Representative samples were sequenced for the envelope (E)
      gene. RESULTS: Regional diversity was observed with regard to the dominant
      circulating serotypes. DENV-2 was found to be the most common serotype in many
      states. Thrombocytopenia, petechiae and malaise were associated with DENV-2
      infection. Phylogenetic analyses of DENV E gene sequences revealed the
      circulation of genotypes I and V of DENV-1, two lineages of DENV-2 genotype IV,
      DENV-3 genotype III and DENV-4 genotype I. CONCLUSIONS: This study found regional
      differences in the prevalence of circulating DENV serotypes in India, and
      provides baseline data for continuous molecular surveillance. Molecular
      surveillance may have implications for predicting large-scale outbreaks of dengue
      if regional shifts in the predominantly circulating serotypes and genotypes are
      detected during the early phase of the dengue season.

TI  - The pattern of kdr mutations correlated with the temperature in field populations
      of Aedes albopictus in China.
PG  - 406
LID - 10.1186/s13071-021-04906-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes albopictus is the primary vector of dengue fever in China. This
      mosquito species has a wide distribution range in China and can be found in the
      tropical climate zones of southern provinces through to temperate climate zones
      of northern provinces. Insecticides are an important control method, especially
      during outbreaks of dengue fever, but increasing insecticide resistance raises
      the risk of failure to control vector-borne diseases. Knockdown resistance (kdr) 
      caused by point mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene is a
      key mechanism that confers resistance to pyrethroids. In this study we explored
      the characteristics and possible evolutionary trend of kdr mutation in Ae.
      albopictus based on analysis of the kdr mutations in field populations of
      mosquitoes in China. METHODS: A total of 1549 adult Ae. albopictus were collected
      from 18 sites in China from 2017 to 2019 and 50 individuals from three sites in
      the 1990s. A fragment of approximately 350 bp from part of the S6 segment in the 
      VGSC gene domain III was amplified and sequenced. Using TCS software version
      1.21A, we constructed haplotypes of the VGSC gene network and calculated outgroup
      probability of the haplotypes. Data of annual average temperatures (AAT) of the
      collection sites were acquired from the national database. The correlation
      between AAT of the collection site and the kdr mutation rate was analyzed by
      Pearson correlation using SPSS software version 21.0. RESULTS: The overall
      frequency of mutant allele F1534 was 45.6%. Nine mutant alleles were detected at 
      codon 1534 in 15 field populations, namely TCC/TCG (S) (38.9%), TTG/CTG/CTC/TTA
      (L) (3.7%), TGC (C) (2.9%), CGC (R) (0.3%) and TGG (W) (0.1%). Only one mutant
      allele, ACC (T), was found at codon 1532, with a frequency of 6.4% in ten field
      populations. Moreover, multiple mutations at alleles I1532 and F1534 in a sample 
      appeared in five populations. The 1534 mutation rate was significantly positively
      related to AAT (Pearson correlation: r(18) = 0.624, P = 0.0056), while the 1532
      mutation rate was significantly negatively related to AAT (Pearson correlation:
      r(18) = - 0.645, P = 0.0038). Thirteen haplotypes were inferred, in which six
      mutant haplotypes were formed by one step, and one additional mutation formed the
      other six haplotypes. In the samples from the 1990s, no mutant allele was
      detected at codon 1532 of the VGSC gene. However, F1534S/TCC was found in HNHK94 
      with an unexpected frequency of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Kdr mutations are widespread
      in the field populations of Ae. albopictus in China. Two novel mutant alleles,
      F1534W/TGG and F1534R/CGC, were detected in this study. The 1534 kdr mutation
      appeared in the population of Ae. albopictus no later than the 1990s. The F1534
      mutation rate was positively correlated with AAT, while the I1532 mutation rate
      was negatively correlated with AAT. These results indicate that iInsecticide
      usage should be carefully managed to slow down the spread of highly resistant Ae.
      albopictus populations, especially in the areas with higher AAT.

AB  - Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become an
      international public health crisis, and the number of cases with dengue
      co-infection has raised concerns. Unfortunately, treatment options are currently 
      limited or even unavailable. Thus, the aim of our study was to explore the
      underlying mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets for
      co-infection. Methods: To further understand the mechanisms underlying
      co-infection, we used a series of bioinformatics analyses to build host factor
      interaction networks and elucidate biological process and molecular function
      categories, pathway activity, tissue-specific enrichment, and potential
      therapeutic agents. Results: We explored the pathologic mechanisms of COVID-19
      and dengue co-infection, including predisposing genes, significant pathways,
      biological functions, and possible drugs for intervention. In total, 460 shared
      host factors were collected; among them, CCL4 and AhR targets were important. To 
      further analyze biological functions, we created a protein-protein interaction
      (PPI) network and performed Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) analysis. In
      addition, common signaling pathways were acquired, and the toll-like receptor and
      NOD-like receptor signaling pathways exerted a significant effect on the
      interaction. Upregulated genes were identified based on the activity score of
      dysregulated genes, such as IL-1, Hippo, and TNF-alpha. We also conducted
      tissue-specific enrichment analysis and found ICAM-1 and CCL2 to be highly
      expressed in the lung. Finally, candidate drugs were screened, including
      resveratrol, genistein, and dexamethasone. Conclusions: This study probes host
      factor interaction networks for COVID-19 and dengue and provides potential drugs 
      for clinical practice. Although the findings need to be verified, they contribute
      to the treatment of co-infection and the management of respiratory disease.

AB  - Dengue fever virus (DENV) is a global health threat that is becoming increasingly
      critical. However, the pathogenesis of dengue has not yet been fully elucidated. 
      In this study, we employed bioinformatics analysis to identify potential
      biomarkers related to dengue fever and clarify their underlying mechanisms. The
      results showed that there were 668, 1901, and 8283 differentially expressed genes
      between the dengue-infected samples and normal samples in the GSE28405, GSE38246,
      and GSE51808 datasets, respectively. Through overlapping, a total of 69
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 51 were
      upregulated and 18 were downregulated. We identified twelve hub genes, including 
      MX1, IFI44L, IFI44, IFI27, ISG15, STAT1, IFI35, OAS3, OAS2, OAS1, IFI6, and
      USP18. Except for IFI44 and STAT1, the others were statistically significant
      after validation. We predicted the related microRNAs (miRNAs) of these 12 target 
      genes through the database miRTarBase, and finally obtained one important miRNA: 
      has-mir-146a-5p. In addition, gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
      Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were carried out, and a
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to gain insight into
      the actions of DEGs. In conclusion, our study displayed the effectiveness of
      bioinformatics analysis methods in screening potential pathogenic genes in dengue
      fever and their underlying mechanisms. Further, we successfully predicted IFI44L 
      and IFI6, as potential biomarkers with DENV infection, providing promising
      targets for the treatment of dengue fever to a certain extent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While vector-borne diseases (VBDs) pose an important public health
      problem worldwide, there is a limited and conflicting knowledge about such
      illnesses in rural or urban settings. The present study aimed to explore the
      social representations (SRs) held by people in the state of Puebla, Mexico on
      insects and the diseases they transmit. Understood as the group of ideas held and
      shared by a group of human beings which enable them to understand and interpret
      the world, SRs constitute what could be called a collective science or knowledge 
      of everyday life. METHODS: The present study was conducted in six municipalities 
      in the state of Puebla, wherein an open-ended questionnaire was applied with
      three age ranges. A total of 360 questionnaires were applied with people
      dedicated to a variety of activities. The survey data was analyzed to identify
      the SR's structure (the central nucleus of the SR and its peripheral system) and 
      the level of organization in order to explore the degree to which the ideas that 
      constitute it are shared and based on consensus. To describe the structure of the
      SR, a network analysis was conducted and complemented by a correspondence
      analysis, which also enables the differences between social groups to be
      identified. RESULTS: Popular knowledge on insects and VBDs is often limited, even
      in communities in which more than one-vector insect is found. The elements that
      were most frequently mentioned in the data, as pertaining to the insect-disease
      relationship, were mosquitoes and dengue fever, with scorpions (which are
      arachnids and not insects) receiving the second-highest number of mentions, while
      other insects such as kissing bugs, flies, and cockroaches were also mentioned as
      transmitting VBDs. While television was the main information source on VBDs for
      the residents of these communities, biology books were also mentioned. Chemical
      control measures (insect repellents) were the most used prevention method, and
      traditional medicine was the remedy most commonly used to treat insect bites and 
      transmitted diseases. Entomophobia was the main cause for the respondents' fear
      and rejection of insects. Beyond the deleterious effects of many insects, those
      surveyed also recognized a positive relationship with insects due to economic and
      nutritional benefits they provide. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides
      relevant information on how insects and the diseases they transmit are perceived 
      by rural and urban communities. Although the population is aware of dengue fever 
      and the role of mosquitoes in transmitting it, information campaigns are required
      for other historically neglected VBDs, such as leishmaniasis, Chagas disease,
      and, even, rickettsiosis. As it is important to understand the impact that these 
      illnesses have on communities further research is required to ensure that better 
      information and guidance is provided on VBDs in order to develop a culture of
      illness prevention in not only the rural but also the metropolitan communities of
      the state of Puebla.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that play critical roles in
      controlling posttranscriptional gene regulation and have a profound effect on
      mosquito reproduction and metabolism. Juvenile hormone (JH) is critical for
      achieving reproductive competence in the main vector of human arboviral diseases,
      Aedes aegypti We report a JH-mediated mechanism governing miRNA expression. Using
      a transcription factor screen with multiple primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) promoters, 
      we identified that the Ecdysone-induced protein E75 (E75) isoform (E75-RD)
      induced miRNA gene promoter activity. E75 binding sites were determined in miRNA 
      promoters by means of cell transfection assay. E75-RD was found to be
      up-regulated by JH, as shown by the JH application and RNA interference (RNAi) of
      the JH receptor Methoprene-tolerant (Met). Small RNA sequencing from RNAi of Met 
      and E75 displayed an overlapping miRNA cohort, suggesting E75 to be an
      intermediate component within the JH hierarchical network controlling miRNAs.
      Further experiments confirmed that E75-RD positively regulates several miRNAs
      including miR-2940. Reducing miR-2940 resulted in the arrest of follicle
      development and number of eggs laid. Performing miRNA target predictions and
      RT-qPCR from antagomir Ant-2940-3p-treated fat body tissues identified the mRNA
      target Clumsy (AAEL002518) The molecular interaction between this gene target and
      miR-2940 was confirmed using an in vitro dual luciferase assay in Drosophila S2
      cells and in Ae. aegypti Aag2 cell lines. Finally, we performed a phenotypic
      rescue experiment to demonstrate that miR-2940/Clumsy is responsible for the
      disruption in egg development. Collectively, these results established the role
      of JH-mediated E75-RD in regulation of miRNA gene expression during the mosquito 
      reproductive cycle.

TI  - The East African Community (EAC) mobile laboratory networks in Kenya, Burundi,
      Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, and South Sudan-from project implementation to outbreak
      response against Dengue, Ebola, COVID-19, and epidemic-prone diseases.
PG  - 160
LID - 10.1186/s12916-021-02028-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: East Africa is home to 170 million people and prone to frequent
      outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fevers and various bacterial diseases. A major
      challenge is that epidemics mostly happen in remote areas, where infrastructure
      for Biosecurity Level (BSL) 3/4 laboratory capacity is not available. As samples 
      have to be transported from the outbreak area to the National Public Health
      Laboratories (NPHL) in the capitals or even flown to international reference
      centres, diagnosis is significantly delayed and epidemics emerge. MAIN TEXT: The 
      East African Community (EAC), an intergovernmental body of Burundi, Rwanda,
      Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and South Sudan, received 10 million euro funding from
      the German Development Bank (KfW) to establish BSL3/4 capacity in the region.
      Between 2017 and 2020, the EAC in collaboration with the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute
      for Tropical Medicine (Germany) and the Partner Countries' Ministries of Health
      and their respective NPHLs, established a regional network of nine mobile BSL3/4 
      laboratories. These rapidly deployable laboratories allowed the region to reduce 
      sample turn-around-time (from days to an average of 8h) at the centre of the
      outbreak and rapidly respond to epidemics. In the present article, the approach
      for implementing such a regional project is outlined and five major aspects
      (including recommendations) are described: (i) the overall project coordination
      activities through the EAC Secretariat and the Partner States, (ii) procurement
      of equipment, (iii) the established laboratory setup and diagnostic panels, (iv) 
      regional training activities and capacity building of various stakeholders and
      (v) completed and ongoing field missions. The latter includes an EAC/WHO field
      simulation exercise that was conducted on the border between Tanzania and Kenya
      in June 2019, the support in molecular diagnosis during the Tanzanian Dengue
      outbreak in 2019, the participation in the Ugandan National Ebola response
      activities in Kisoro district along the Uganda/DRC border in Oct/Nov 2019 and the
      deployments of the laboratories to assist in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics throughout
      the region since early 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The established EAC mobile laboratory
      network allows accurate and timely diagnosis of BSL3/4 pathogens in all East
      African countries, important for individual patient management and to effectively
      contain the spread of epidemic-prone diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization's (WHO) Neglected Tropical Disease
      (NTD) Road Map for 2021-2030 was recently endorsed by all member states at the
      World Health Assembly in November 2020. Although only 3 of the 20 NTDs are
      endemic in Canada (i.e., echinococcosis, rabies, and scabies), the Canadian
      research community has contributed to advancing the knowledge base of all 20
      NTDs. Previous research comprehensively detailed Canadian research on 11 NTDs
      between 1950 and 2010 using a network analysis approach. The specific objective
      of the present analysis was to update the publication record over the last decade
      (2010-2019) to include all 20 NTDs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A bibliometric
      analysis was conducted in Scopus and Web of Science databases (for English or
      French articles published between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019) using
      appropriate search terms for each of the 20 NTDs and where at least 1 of the
      authors had a Canadian institution address. A 21st search was added to include
      publications including multiple NTDs or a discussion of NTDs in general.
      Following assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2 reviewers
      independently screened all abstracts, with discordant observations rereviewed to 
      arrive at an agreement. Duplicates were removed. RESULTS: A total of 1,790
      publications were retrieved (1,738 with a disease-specific NTD focus and 52 with 
      a general NTD focus, resulting in 1,659 unique publications), giving an average
      of over 160 articles per year. Over 80% were classified as full-length research
      articles. The top 3 journals in terms of frequency were PLOS Neglected Tropical
      Diseases, PLOS ONE, and the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.
      Authors' institutions were from all Canadian provinces. While all 20 NTDs were
      addressed in these publications, the 5 most commonly studied were leishmaniasis, 
      dengue fever and chikungunya, Chagas disease, soil-transmitted helminthiases, and
      rabies. CONCLUSIONS: Canadian researchers across the country have contributed to 
      the evidence base of all 20 NTDs, publishing an average of over 160 publications 
      per year between 2010 and 2019. As WHO NTD Road Map 2021-2030 rolls out globally,
      the Canadian research community, in collaboration with its partners and in
      solidarity with people living in vulnerable circumstances in endemic regions
      worldwide, is well positioned to meet future research challenges so that the goal
      of eliminating the disease burden attributable to NTDs can be achieved.

AB  - Dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) contributes substantially to the dengue burden and
      dengue-related mortality in the tropics and sub-tropics. DENV-2 includes six
      genotypes, among which cosmopolitan genotype is the most widespread. The present 
      study investigated the evolution, intra-genotype heterogeneity and dispersal of
      cosmopolitan genotype to understand unique genetic characteristics that have
      shaped the molecular epidemiology and distribution of cosmopolitan lineages. The 
      spatial analysis demonstrated a wide geo-distribution of cosmopolitan genotype
      through an extensive inter-continental network, anchored in Southeast Asia and
      Indian sub-continent. Intra-genotype analyses using 3367 envelope gene sequences 
      revealed six distinct lineages within the cosmopolitan genotype, namely the
      Indian sub-continent lineage and five other lineages. Indian sub-continent
      lineage was the most diverged among six lineages and has almost reached the
      nucleotide divergence threshold of 6% within E gene to qualify as a separate
      genotype. Genome wide amino acid signatures and selection pressure analyses
      further suggested differences in evolutionary characteristics between the Indian 
      sub-continent lineage and other lineages. The present study narrates a
      comprehensive genomic analysis of cosmopolitan genotype and presents notable
      genetic characteristics that occurred during its evolution and global expansion. 
      Whether those characteristics conferred a fitness advantage to cosmopolitan
      genotype in different geographies warrant further investigations.

TI  - Impact of underground storm drain systems on larval ecology of Culex and Aedes
      species in urban environments of Southern California.
PG  - 12667
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-92190-3 [doi]
AB  - An extensive network of storm water conveyance systems in urban areas, often
      referred to as the "underground storm drain system" (USDS), serves as significant
      production habitats for mosquitoes. Knowledge of whether USDS habitats are
      suitable for newly introduced dengue vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus
      will help guide surveillance and control efforts. To determine whether the USDS
      functions as a suitable larval habitat for Culex, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus 
      in southern California, we examined mosquito habitat utilization and larval
      survivorship using laboratory microcosm studies. The data showed that USDS
      constituted 4.1% of sampled larval habitats for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus,
      and 22.0% for Cx. quinquefasciatus. Furthermore, USDS water collected in the
      summer completely inhibited Aedes larval development, but yielded a 15.0%
      pupation rate for Cx. quinquefasciatus. Food supplementation in the microcosms
      suggests that nutrient deficiency, toxins and other factors in the USDS water led
      to low success or complete failure of larval development. These results suggest
      that USDS habitats are currently not major productive larval habitats for Aedes
      mosquitoes in southern California. Our findings prompt inclusion of assessments
      of pupal productivity in USDS habitats and adult mosquito resting sites in the
      mosquito surveillance program.

      January 2017 to December 2019. Among 120 adult patients hospitalized due to DVI
      without preexisting kidney diseases, 17 patients (14%) presented with AKI. During
      hospitalization, four patients required acute hemodialysis. The predominant
      characteristic of urinalysis was proteinuria, followed by pyuria and hematuria
      with remarkable dysmorphic red blood cells. Complications included acidosis,
      followed by hyperkalemia and volume overload. Most complications and
      deterioration of renal function occurred within the first week, but renal
      function recovered in second week of hospitalization. Stability of renal function
      was regained within the fourth week to the third month. However, four AKI
      patients recovered, with estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 
      within 3 months. Forty-day mortality rate and resource utilization, including
      hospital cost and length of hospitalization, among those with AKI were
      significantly higher than those without AKI. Thirty-day and in-hospital mortality
      rate among those with AKI was also higher than those without AKI. High APACHE II 
      scores due to bleeding disorder and current use of non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory agent were significantly associated with the emergence of AKI. 
      Acute kidney injury among adult patients hospitalized due to DVI should be a
      concern and should be monitored for prompt treatment and follow-up.

AB  - The prediction of hospital patients and outpatients with suspected arboviral
      infection individuals in research-limited settings of the urban areas is defined 
      as a challenging process for clinicians. Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika
      arboviruses have gained attention in recent years because of the high prevalence 
      in the society and financial burden of major global health systems. In this
      study, we proposed a machine learning algorithm based prediction model over
      retrospective medical records, which are named as SISA (the Severity Index for
      Suspected Arbovirus) and SISAL (the Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus with
      Laboratory) datasets. Therefore, we aim to inform the clinicians about the use of
      machine learning with transfer learning success for diagnosis and comprehensive
      comparison of the classification performances over the SISA/SISAL datasets in the
      resource-limited settings that may cause to the small datasets of arboviral
      infection. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory
      have achieved 100% accuracy and 1 of area under the curve (AUC) score, Fully
      Connected Deep Network has provided 92.86% accuracy and 0.969 AUC score in the
      SISAL dataset with transfer learning. Moreover, 98.73% accuracy and 0.988 AUC
      score were obtained by Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory
      for the SISA dataset. Furthermore, Linear Discriminant Analysis (shallow
      algorithm) has provided reaching up to 96.43% accuracy. Notably, deep learning
      based models have achieved improved performances compared to the previously
      reported study.

TI  - Sterile Insect Technique: Successful Suppression of an Aedes aegypti Field
      Population in Cuba.
LID - 469 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects12050469 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus infections are a serious public health problem worldwide. Aedes
      aegypti is the primary vector of dengue in Cuba. As there is no vaccine or
      specific treatment, the control efforts are directed to the reduction of mosquito
      populations. The indiscriminate use of insecticides can lead to adverse effects
      on ecosystems, including human health. The sterile insect technique is a
      species-specific and environment-friendly method of insect population control
      based on the release of large numbers of sterile insects, ideally males only. The
      success of this technique for the sustainable management of agricultural pests
      has encouraged its evaluation for the population suppression of mosquito vector
      species. Here, we describe an open field trial to evaluate the effect of the
      release of irradiated male Ae. aegypti on a wild population. The pilot trial was 
      carried out in a suburb of Havana and compared the mosquito population density
      before and after the intervention, in both untreated control and release areas.
      The wild population was monitored by an ovitrap network, recording frequency and 
      density of eggs as well as their hatch rate. A significant amount of sterility
      was induced in the field population of the release area, as compared with the
      untreated control area. The ovitrap index and the mean number of eggs/trap
      declined dramatically after 12 and 5 weeks of releases, respectively. For the
      last 3 weeks, no eggs were collected in the treatment area, clearly indicating a 
      significant suppression of the wild target population. We conclude that the
      sterile males released competed successfully and induced enough sterility to
      suppress the local Ae. aegypti population.

TI  - DeepImmuno: deep learning-empowered prediction and generation of immunogenic
      peptides for T-cell immunity.
LID - bbab160 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbab160 [doi]
AB  - Cytolytic T-cells play an essential role in the adaptive immune system by seeking
      out, binding and killing cells that present foreign antigens on their surface. An
      improved understanding of T-cell immunity will greatly aid in the development of 
      new cancer immunotherapies and vaccines for life-threatening pathogens. Central
      to the design of such targeted therapies are computational methods to predict
      non-native peptides to elicit a T-cell response, however, we currently lack
      accurate immunogenicity inference methods. Another challenge is the ability to
      accurately simulate immunogenic peptides for specific human leukocyte antigen
      alleles, for both synthetic biological applications, and to augment real training
      datasets. Here, we propose a beta-binomial distribution approach to derive
      peptide immunogenic potential from sequence alone. We conducted systematic
      benchmarking of five traditional machine learning (ElasticNet, K-nearest
      neighbors, support vector machine, Random Forest and AdaBoost) and three deep
      learning models (convolutional neural network (CNN), Residual Net and graph
      neural network) using three independent prior validated immunogenic peptide
      collections (dengue virus, cancer neoantigen and SARS-CoV-2). We chose the CNN as
      the best prediction model, based on its adaptivity for small and large datasets
      and performance relative to existing methods. In addition to outperforming two
      highly used immunogenicity prediction algorithms, DeepImmuno-CNN correctly
      predicts which residues are most important for T-cell antigen recognition and
      predicts novel impacts of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our independent generative
      adversarial network (GAN) approach, DeepImmuno-GAN, was further able to
      accurately simulate immunogenic peptides with physicochemical properties and
      immunogenicity predictions similar to that of real antigens. We provide
      DeepImmuno-CNN as source code and an easy-to-use web interface.

AB  - Pathogenic mosquito-borne viruses are a serious public health issue in tropical
      and subtropical regions and are increasingly becoming a problem in other climate 
      zones. Drug repositioning is a rapid, pharmaco-economic approach that can be used
      to identify compounds that target these neglected tropical diseases. We have
      applied a computational drug repositioning method to five mosquito-borne viral
      infections: dengue virus (DENV), zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV),
      Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIV). We identified
      signature molecules and pathways for each virus infection based on omics
      analyses, and determined 77 drug candidates and 146 proteins for those diseases
      by using a filtering method. Based on the omics analyses, we analyzed the
      relationship among drugs, target proteins and the five viruses by projecting the 
      signature molecules onto a human protein-protein interaction network. We have
      classified the drug candidates according to the degree of target proteins in the 
      protein-protein interaction network for the five infectious diseases.

AB  - Recently, four new strains of SARS-COV-2 were reported in different countries
      which are mutants and considered as 70 % more dangerous than the existing
      covid-19 virus. In this paper, hybrid mathematical models of new strains and
      co-infection in Caputo, Caputo-Fabrizio, and Atangana-Baleanu are presented. The 
      idea behind this co-infection modeling is that, as per medical reports, both
      dengue and covid-19 have similar symptoms at the early stages. Our aim is to
      evaluate and predict the transmission dynamics of both deadly viruses. The
      qualitative study via stability analysis is discussed at equilibria and
      reproduction number R 0 is computed. For the numerical purpose,
      Adams-Bashforth-Moulton and Newton methods are employed to obtain the approximate
      solutions of the proposed model. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to assessed 
      the effects of various biological parameters and rates of transmission on the
      dynamics of both viruses. We also compared our results with some reported data
      against infected, recovered, and death cases.

TI  - Using Data Mining and Network Analysis to Infer Arboviral Dynamics: The Case of
      Mosquito-Borne Flaviviruses Reported in Mexico.
LID - 398 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects12050398 [doi]
AB  - Given the significant impact of mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFVs) on both human
      and animal health, predicting their dynamics and understanding their transmission
      cycle is of the utmost importance. Usually, predictions about the distribution of
      priority pathogens, such as Dengue, Yellow fever, West Nile Virus and St. Louis
      encephalitis, relate abiotic elements to simple biotic components, such as a
      single causal agent. Furthermore, focusing on single pathogens neglects the
      possibility of interactions and the existence of common elements in the
      transmission cycles of multiple pathogens. A necessary, but not sufficient,
      condition that a mosquito be a vector of a MBFV is that it co-occurs with hosts
      of the pathogen. We therefore use a recently developed modeling framework, based 
      on co-occurrence data, to infer potential biotic interactions between those
      mosquito and mammal species which have previously been identified as vectors or
      confirmed positives of at least one of the considered MBFVs. We thus create
      models for predicting the relative importance of mosquito species as potential
      vectors for each pathogen, and also for all pathogens together, using the known
      vectors to validate the models. We infer that various mosquito species are likely
      to be significant vectors, even though they have not currently been identified as
      such, and are likely to harbor multiple pathogens, again validating the
      predictions with known results. Besides the above "niche-based" viewpoint we also
      consider an assemblage-based analysis, wherein we use a community-identification 
      algorithm to identify those mosquito and/or mammal species that form assemblages 
      by dint of their significant degree of co-occurrence. The most cohesive
      assemblage includes important primary vectors, such as A. aegypti, A. albopictus,
      C. quinquefasciatus, C. pipiens and mammals with abundant populations that are
      well-adapted to human environments, such as the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
      virginianus), peccary (Tayassu pecari), opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) and bats 
      (Artibeus lituratus and Sturnira lilium). Our results suggest that this
      assemblage has an important role in the transmission dynamics of this viral group
      viewed as a complex multi-pathogen-vector-host system. By including biotic risk
      factors our approach also modifies the geographical risk profiles of the spatial 
      distribution of MBFVs in Mexico relative to a consideration of only abiotic niche
      variables.

TI  - Identification of significant climatic risk factors and machine learning models
      in dengue outbreak prediction.
PG  - 141
LID - 10.1186/s12911-021-01493-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is a widespread viral disease and one of the world's
      major pandemic vector-borne infections, causing serious hazard to humanity. The
      World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that the incidence of dengue fever has
      increased dramatically across the world in recent decades. WHO currently
      estimates an annual incidence of 50-100 million dengue infections worldwide. To
      date, no tested vaccine or treatment is available to stop or prevent dengue
      fever. Thus, the importance of predicting dengue outbreaks is significant. The
      current issue that should be addressed in dengue outbreak prediction is accuracy.
      A limited number of studies have conducted an in-depth analysis of climate
      factors in dengue outbreak prediction. METHODS: The most important climatic
      factors that contribute to dengue outbreaks were identified in the current work. 
      Correlation analyses were performed in order to determine these factors and these
      factors were used as input parameters for machine learning models. Top five
      machine learning classification models (Bayes network (BN) models, support vector
      machine (SVM), RBF tree, decision table and naive Bayes) were chosen based on
      past research. The models were then tested and evaluated on the basis of 4-year
      data (January 2010 to December 2013) collected in Malaysia. RESULTS: This
      research has two major contributions. A new risk factor, called the TempeRain
      factor (TRF), was identified and used as an input parameter for the model of
      dengue outbreak prediction. Moreover, TRF was applied to demonstrate its strong
      impact on dengue outbreaks. Experimental results showed that the Bayes Network
      model with the new meteorological risk factor identified in this study increased 
      accuracy to 92.35% for predicting dengue outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: This research
      explored the factors used in dengue outbreak prediction systems. The major
      contribution of this study is identifying new significant factors that contribute
      to dengue outbreak prediction. From the evaluation result, we obtained a
      significant improvement in the accuracy of a machine learning model for dengue
      outbreak prediction.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of the WHO clinical definitions for dengue and implications
      for surveillance: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e0009359
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009359 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is the world's most common mosquito-borne virus but remains
      diagnostically challenging due to its nonspecific presentation. Access to
      laboratory confirmation is limited and thus most reported figures are based on
      clinical diagnosis alone, the accuracy of which is uncertain. This systematic
      review assesses the diagnostic accuracy of the traditional (1997) and revised
      (2009) WHO clinical case definitions for dengue fever, the basis for most
      national guidelines. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus,
      OpenGrey, and the annual Dengue Bulletin were searched for studies assessing the 
      diagnostic accuracy of the unmodified clinical criteria. Two reviewers (NR/SL)
      independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias
      using a modified QUADAS-2. Additional records were found by citation network
      analysis. A meta-analysis was done using a bivariate mixed-effects regression
      model. Studies that modified criteria were analysed separately. This systematic
      review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020165998). We identified 11 and
      12 datasets assessing the 1997 and 2009 definition, respectively, and 6 using
      modified criteria. Sensitivity was 93% (95% CI: 77-98) and 93% (95% CI: 86-96)
      for the 1997 and 2009 definitions, respectively. Specificity was 29% (95% CI:
      8-65) and 31% (95% CI: 18-48) for the 1997 and 2009 definitions, respectively.
      Diagnostic performance suffered at the extremes of age. No modification
      significantly improved accuracy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Diagnostic accuracy of
      clinical criteria is poor, with significant implications for surveillance and
      public health responses for dengue control. As the basis for most reported
      figures, this has relevance to policymakers planning resource allocation and
      researchers modelling transmission, particularly during COVID-19.

AB  - The worldwide eruption of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that began in
      Wuhan, China in late 2019 reached 10 million cases by late June 2020. In order to
      understand the epidemiological landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies
      have attempted to elucidate phylogenetic relationships between collected viral
      genome sequences using haplotype networks. However, currently available
      applications for network visualization are not suited to understand the COVID-19 
      epidemic spatiotemporally due to functional limitations that motivated us to
      develop Haplotype Explorer, an intuitive tool for visualizing and exploring
      haplotype networks. Haplotype Explorer enables to dissect epidemiological
      consequences via interactive node filters and provides the perspective on
      infectious disease dynamics depend on regions and time, such as introduction,
      outbreak, expansion, and containment. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
      Haplotype Explorer by showing features and an example of visualization. The demo 
      using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes are
      available at https://github.com/TKSjp/HaplotypeExplorer/blob/master/Example/.
      There are several examples using SARS-CoV-2 genomes and Dengue virus serotype 1
      E-genes sequence.

AB  - COVID-19 has remained an uncontained, worldwide pandemic. While battling for the 
      disease in China, six Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) recipes have been shown 
      to be remarkably effective for treating patients with COVID-19. The present
      review discusses principles of TCM in curing infectious disease, and clinical
      evidence and mechanisms of the 6 most effective TCM recipes used in treating
      COVID-19 in 92% of all of the confirmed cases in China. Applications of TCM and
      specific recipes in the treatment of other viral infections, such as those caused
      by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza A virus
      (including H1N1 and H7N9), influenza B, dengue virus as well as Ebola virus, are 
      also discussed. Among the 6 TCM recipes, Jinhua Qinggan (JHQG) granules and
      Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) capsules are recommended during medical observation; Lung 
      Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction (LCDD) is recommended for the treatment of
      both severe and non-severe patients; Xuanfeibaidu (XFBD) granules are recommended
      for treating moderate cases; while Huashibaidu (HSBD) and Xuebijing (XBJ) have
      been used in managing severe cases effectively. The common components and the
      active ingredients of the six TCM recipes have been summarized to reveal most
      promising drug candidates. The potential molecular mechanisms of the active
      ingredients in the six TCM recipes that target ACE2, 3CL(pro) and IL-6, revealed 
      by molecular biological studies and/or network pharmacology prediction/molecular 
      docking analysis/visualization analysis, are fully discussed. Therefore, further 
      investigation of these TCM recipes may be of high translational value in enabling
      novel targeted therapies for COVID-19, potentially via purification and
      characterization of the active ingredients in the effective TCM recipes.

AB  - Severe dengue outbreaks (DOs) affect the majority of Asian and Latin American
      countries. Whether all DOs always occurred in sub-tropical and tropical areas
      (STTA) has not been verified. We downloaded abstracts by searching keywords
      "dengue (MeSH Major Topic)" from Pubmed Central since 1950, including three
      collections: country names in abstracts (CNA), no abstracts (WA), and no country 
      names in abstracts (Non-CNA). Visualizations were created to present the DOs
      across countries/areas in STTA. The percentages of mentioned country names and
      authors' countries in STTA were computed on the CNA and Non-CNA bases. The social
      network analysis was applied to highlight the most cited articles and countries. 
      We found that (1) three collections are 3427 (25.48%), 3137 (23.33%), and 6884
      (51.19%) in CNA, WA, and Non-CNA, respectively; (2) the percentages of 94.3% and 
      79.9% were found in the CNA and Non-CNA groups; (3) the most mentioned country in
      abstracts were India, Thailand, and Brazil; (4) most authors in the Non-CNA
      collections were from the United States, Brazil, and China; (5) the most cited
      article (PMID = 23563266) authored by Bhatt et al. had 2604 citations since 2013.
      Our findings provide in-depth insights into the DO knowledge. The research
      approaches are recommended for authors in research on other infectious diseases
      in the future, not just limited to the DO topic.

AB  - Argonaute (AGO) proteins bind small RNAs to silence complementary RNA
      transcripts, and they are central to RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi is critical
      for regulation of gene expression and antiviral defense in Aedes aegypti
      mosquitoes, which transmit Zika, chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever viruses.
      In mosquitoes, AGO1 mediates miRNA interactions, while AGO2 mediates siRNA
      interactions. We applied AGO-crosslinking immunoprecipitation (AGO-CLIP) for both
      AGO1 and AGO2, and we developed a universal software package for CLIP analysis
      (CLIPflexR), identifying 230 small RNAs and 5,447 small RNA targets that comprise
      a comprehensive RNAi network map in mosquitoes. RNAi network maps predicted
      expression levels of small RNA targets in specific tissues. Additionally, this
      resource identified unexpected, context-dependent AGO2 target preferences,
      including endogenous viral elements and 3'UTRs. Finally, contrary to current
      thinking, mosquito AGO2 repressed imperfect targets. These findings expand our
      understanding of small RNA networks and have broad implications for the study of 
      antiviral RNAi.

TI  - Aedes aegypti miRNA-33 modulates permethrin induced toxicity by regulating VGSC
      transcripts.
PG  - 7301
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-86665-6 [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti is a major vector of Zika, dengue, and other arboviruses.
      Permethrin adulticidal spraying, which targets the voltage-gated sodium channel
      (VGSC), is commonly done to reduce local mosquito populations and protect humans 
      from exposure to arbovirus pathogens transmitted by this dangerous pest.
      Permethrin resistance, however, is a growing problem and understanding its
      underlying molecular basis may identify avenues to combat it. We identified a
      single G:C polymorphism in pre-miR-33 that was genetically associated with
      permethrin resistance; resulting isoforms had structural differences that may
      affect DICER-1/pre-miRNA processing rates. We then assessed the effects of
      overexpression of pre-miR-33 isoforms on permethrin toxicological phenotypes,
      VGSC transcript abundance and protein levels for two genetically related mosquito
      strains. One strain had its naturally high permethrin resistance levels
      maintained by periodic treatment, and the other was released from selection. VGSC
      protein levels were lower in the permethrin resistant strain than in the related 
      permethrin-susceptible strain. Overexpression of the G-pre-miR-33 isoform reduced
      VGSC expression levels in both strains. To further elucidate changes in gene
      expression associated with permethrin resistance, exome-capture gDNA deep
      sequencing, genetic association mapping and subsequent gene set enrichment
      analysis revealed that transport genes, in particular, were selected in resistant
      versus susceptible mosquitoes. Collectively, these data indicate that miR-33
      regulates VGSC expression as part of a nuanced system of neuronal regulation that
      contributes to a network of heritable features determining permethrin resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever (DF) is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has
      threatened tropical and subtropical regions in recent decades. An early and
      targeted warning of a dengue epidemic is important for vector control. Current
      studies have primarily determined weather conditions to be the main factor for
      dengue forecasting, thereby neglecting that environmental suitability for
      mosquito breeding is also an important factor, especially in fine-grained
      intra-urban settings. Considering that street-view images are promising for
      depicting physical environments, this study proposes a framework for facilitating
      fine-grained intra-urban dengue forecasting by integrating the urban environments
      measured from street-view images. METHODS: The dengue epidemic that occurred in
      167 townships of Guangzhou City, China, between 2015 and 2019 was taken as a
      study case. First, feature vectors of street-view images acquired inside each
      township were extracted by a pre-trained convolutional neural network, and then
      aggregated as an environmental feature vector of the township. Thus, townships
      with similar physical settings would exhibit similar environmental features.
      Second, the environmental feature vector is combined with commonly used features 
      (e.g., temperature, rainfall, and past case count) as inputs to machine-learning 
      models for weekly dengue forecasting. RESULTS: The performance of
      machine-learning forecasting models (i.e., MLP and SVM) integrated with and
      without environmental features were compared. This indicates that models
      integrating environmental features can identify high-risk urban units across the 
      city more precisely than those using common features alone. In addition, the top 
      30% of high-risk townships predicted by our proposed methods can capture
      approximately 50-60% of dengue cases across the city. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating 
      local environments measured from street view images is effective in facilitating 
      fine-grained intra-urban dengue forecasting, which is beneficial for conducting
      spatially precise dengue prevention and control.

TI  - COVID-DeepPredictor: Recurrent Neural Network to Predict SARS-CoV-2 and Other
      Pathogenic Viruses.
PG  - 569120
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2021.569120 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 disease for Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has turned out to be a
      global pandemic. The high transmission rate of this pathogenic virus demands an
      early prediction and proper identification for the subsequent treatment. However,
      polymorphic nature of this virus allows it to adapt and sustain in different
      kinds of environment which makes it difficult to predict. On the other hand,
      there are other pathogens like SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Dengue, and Influenza
      as well, so that a predictor is highly required to distinguish them with the use 
      of their genomic information. To mitigate this problem, in this work
      COVID-DeepPredictor is proposed on the framework of deep learning to identify an 
      unknown sequence of these pathogens. COVID-DeepPredictor uses Long Short Term
      Memory as Recurrent Neural Network for the underlying prediction with an
      alignment-free technique. In this regard, k-mer technique is applied to create
      Bag-of-Descriptors (BoDs) in order to generate Bag-of-Unique-Descriptors (BoUDs) 
      as vocabulary and subsequently embedded representation is prepared for the given 
      virus sequences. This predictor is not only validated for the dataset using K
      -fold cross-validation but also for unseen test datasets of SARS-CoV-2 sequences 
      and sequences from other viruses as well. To verify the efficacy of
      COVID-DeepPredictor, it has been compared with other state-of-the-art prediction 
      techniques based on Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forests, and Gradient
      Boosting Method. COVID-DeepPredictor achieves 100% prediction accuracy on
      validation dataset while on test datasets, the accuracy ranges from 99.51 to
      99.94%. It shows superior results over other prediction techniques as well. In
      addition to this, accuracy and runtime of COVID-DeepPredictor are considered
      simultaneously to determine the value of k in k-mer, a comparative study among k 
      values in k-mer, Bag-of-Descriptors (BoDs), and Bag-of-Unique-Descriptors (BoUDs)
      and a comparison between COVID-DeepPredictor and Nucleotide BLAST have also been 
      performed. The code, training, and test datasets used for COVID-DeepPredictor are
      available at http://www.nitttrkol.ac.in/indrajit/projects/COVID-DeepPredictor/.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nepal has always been a popular international travel destination.
      There is limited published data, however, on the spectrum of illnesses acquired
      by travellers to Nepal. METHODS: GeoSentinel is a global data collection network 
      of travel and tropical medicine providers that monitors travel-related morbidity.
      Records for ill travellers with at least one confirmed or probable diagnosis,
      were extracted from the GeoSentinel database for the CIWEC Clinic Kathmandu site 
      from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2017. RESULTS: A total of 24,271 records
      were included. The median age was 30 years (range: 0-91); 54% were female. The
      top 3 system-based diagnoses in travellers were: gastrointestinal (32%),
      pulmonary (16%), and dermatologic (9%). Altitude illness comprised 9% of all
      diagnoses. There were 278 vaccine-preventable diseases, most frequently influenza
      A (41%) and typhoid fever (19%; S. typhi 52 and S. paratyphi 62). Of 64
      vector-borne illnesses, dengue was the most frequent (64%), followed by imported 
      malaria (14%). There was a single traveller with Japanese encephalitis. Six
      deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Travellers to Nepal face a wide spectrum of
      illnesses, particularly diarrhoea, respiratory disease, and altitude illness.
      Pre-travel consultations for travellers to Nepal should focus on prevention and
      treatment of diarrhoea and altitude illness, along with appropriate immunizations
      and travel advice.

AB  - In response to the Zika epidemics in Brazil, the ZDC molecular assay
      (Bio-Manguinhos) was developed and registered at the Brazilian Regulatory Agency 
      of Health Surveillance - ANVISA. The circulation of Zika (ZIKV) Dengue (DENV) and
      Chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses and their clinical similarities are challenges to
      correctly diagnose these viruses. The simultaneous detection of ZIKV, DENV and
      CHIKV is an important tool for diagnosis and surveillance. Here, we present the
      analytical and clinical performance evaluation of ZDC molecular assay
      (Bio-Manguinhos) at the public health laboratories three years after its
      registration at ANVISA. The clinical performance demonstrates the ZDC molecular
      assay (Bio-Manguinhos) has 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity to detect and
      discriminate ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV from clinical plasma samples. The ZDC
      molecular assay (Bio-Manguinhos) results were highly reproducible and no
      cross-reactivity was seen during testing with a panel of other infectious agents.
      In conclusion, the ZDC molecular assay (Bio-Manguinhos) is an accurate and
      reliable tool to monitor Zika, dengue and chikungunya infections in countries
      like Brazil with simultaneous circulation of the three viruses.

TI  - Wolbachia and Virus Alter the Host Transcriptome at the Interface of Nucleotide
      Metabolism Pathways.
LID - e03472-20 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.03472-20 [doi]
AB  - Wolbachia is a maternally transmitted bacterium that manipulates arthropod and
      nematode biology in myriad ways. The Wolbachia strain colonizing Drosophila
      melanogaster creates sperm-egg incompatibilities and protects its host against
      RNA viruses, making it a promising tool for vector control. Despite successful
      trials using Wolbachia-transfected mosquitoes for dengue control, knowledge of
      how Wolbachia and viruses jointly affect insect biology remains limited. Using
      the Drosophila melanogaster model, transcriptomics and gene expression network
      analyses revealed pathways with altered expression and splicing due to Wolbachia 
      colonization and virus infection. Included are metabolic pathways previously
      unknown to be important for Wolbachia-host interactions. Additionally,
      Wolbachia-colonized flies exhibit a dampened transcriptomic response to virus
      infection, consistent with early blocking of virus replication. Finally, using
      Drosophila genetics, we show that Wolbachia and expression of nucleotide
      metabolism genes have interactive effects on virus replication. Understanding the
      mechanisms of pathogen blocking will contribute to the effective development of
      Wolbachia-mediated vector control programs.IMPORTANCE Recently developed
      arbovirus control strategies leverage the symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia, which
      spreads in insect populations and blocks viruses from replicating. While this
      strategy has been successful, details of how this "pathogen blocking" works are
      limited. Here, we use a combination of virus infections, fly genetics, and
      transcriptomics to show that Wolbachia and virus interact at host nucleotide

TI  - Risk Assessment of Dengue Transmission in Bangladesh Using a Spatiotemporal
      Network Model and Climate Data.

AB  - Vector-borne disease risk assessment is crucial to optimize surveillance,
      preventative measures (vector control), and resource allocation (medical
      supplies). High arthropod abundance and host interaction strongly correlate to
      vector-borne pathogen transmission. Increasing host density and movement
      increases the possibility of local and long-distance pathogen transmission.
      Therefore, we developed a risk-assessment framework using climate (average
      temperature and rainfall) and host demographic (host density and movement) data, 
      particularly suitable for regions with unreported or underreported incidence
      data. This framework consisted of a spatiotemporal network-based approach coupled
      with a compartmental disease model and nonhomogeneous Gillespie algorithm. The
      correlation of climate data with vector abundance and host-vector interactions is
      expressed as vectorial capacity-a parameter that governs the spreading of
      infection from an infected host to a susceptible one via vectors. As an example, 
      the framework is applied for dengue in Bangladesh. Vectorial capacity is inferred
      for each week throughout a year using average monthly temperature and rainfall
      data. Long-distance pathogen transmission is expressed with human movement data
      in the spatiotemporal network. We have identified the spatiotemporal suitability 
      of dengue spreading in Bangladesh as well as the significant-incidence window and
      peak-incidence period. Analysis of yearly dengue data variation suggests the
      possibility of a significant outbreak with a new serotype introduction. The
      outcome of the framework comprised spatiotemporal suitability maps and
      probabilistic risk maps for spatial infection spreading. This framework is
      capable of vector-borne disease risk assessment without historical incidence data
      and can be a useful tool for preparedness with accurate human movement data.

      implications for clinical management.

AB  - The microcirculation comprising of arterioles, capillaries and post-capillary
      venules is the terminal vascular network of the systemic circulation.
      Microvascular homeostasis, comprising of a balance between vasoconstriction,
      vasodilation and endothelial permeability in healthy states, regulates tissue
      perfusion. In severe infections, systemic inflammation occurs irrespective of the
      infecting microorganism(s), resulting in microcirculatory dysregulation and
      dysfunction, which impairs tissue perfusion and often precedes end-organ failure.
      The common hallmarks of microvascular dysfunction in both septic shock and dengue
      shock, are endothelial cell activation, glycocalyx degradation and plasma leak
      through a disrupted endothelial barrier. Microvascular tone is also impaired by a
      reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide. In vitro and in vivo studies have
      however demonstrated that the nature and extent of microvascular dysfunction as
      well as responses to volume expansion resuscitation differ in these two clinical 
      syndromes. This review compares and contrasts the pathophysiology of
      microcirculatory dysfunction in septic versus dengue shock and the attendant
      effects of fluid administration during resuscitation.

AB  - Blood-sucking insects are important vectors of disease, with biting Diptera
      (flies) alone transmitting diseases that cause an estimated 700 000 human deaths 
      a year. Insect vectors also bite nonhuman hosts, linking them into host-biting
      networks. While the major vectors of prominent diseases, such as malaria, yellow 
      fever, dengue, and Zika, are intensively studied, there has been limited focus on
      the wider interactions of biting insects with nonhuman hosts. Drawing on network 
      analysis and visualisation approaches from food-web ecology, we discuss the value
      of a network perspective for understanding host-insect-disease interactions, with
      a focus on Diptera vectors. Potential applications include highlighting pathways 
      of disease transmission, highlighting reservoirs of infection, and identifying
      emerging and previously unrecognised vectors.

TI  - Hemorrhagic fever in Saudi Arabia: challenge to public health, effective
      management and future considerations.
PG  - 1153-1163
LID - 10.4314/ahs.v20i3.17 [doi]
AB  - Background: Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) refers to a group of febrile illnesses
      caused by different viruses that result in high mortality in animals and humans. 
      Many risk factors like increased human-animal interactions, climate change,
      increased mobility of people and limited diagnostic facility have contributed to 
      the rapid spread of VHF. Materials: The history of VHFs in the Saudi Arabian
      Peninsula has been documented since the 19(th) century, in which many outbreaks
      have been reported from the southwestern region of Saudi Arabia. Despite presence
      of regional network of experts and technical organizations, which expedite
      support and respond during outbreaks, there are some more challenges that need to
      be addressed immediately. Gaps in funding, exhaustive and inclusive response
      plans and improved surveillance systems are some areas of concern in the region
      which can be dealt productively. This review primarily focusses on the
      hemorrhagic fevers that are caused by three most common viruses namely, the
      Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift valley fever virus, and Dengue fever
      virus. Conclusion: In summary, effective vector control, health education,
      possible use of vaccine and concerted synchronized efforts between different
      government organizations and private research institutions will help in planning 
      effective outbreak-prevention and response strategies in future.

AB  - Dengue viral disease has been reported as an Aedes aegypti mosquito-borne human
      disease and causing a severe global public health concern. In this study,
      immunoinformatics methods was deployed for crafting CTL T-cell epitopes as dengue
      vaccine candidates. The NS1 protein sequence of dengue serotype 1 strain
      retrieved from the protein database and T-cell epitopes (n = 85) were predicted
      by the artificial neural network. The conserved epitopes (n = 10) were predicted 
      and selected for intensive computational analysis. The machine learning technique
      and quantitative matrix-based toxicity analysis assured nontoxic peptide
      selection. Hidden Markov Model derived Structural Alphabet (SA) based algorithm
      predicted the 3D molecular structure and all-atom structure of peptide ligand
      validated by Ramachandran-plot. Three-tier molecular docking approaches were used
      to predictthe peptide - HLA docking complex. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
      study confirmed the docking complex was stable in the time frame of 100ns.
      Population coverage analysis predicted the interaction epitope interaction with a
      particular population of HLA. These results concluded that the computationally
      designed HTLWSNGVL and FTTNIWLKL epitope peptides could be used as putative
      agents for the multi CTL T cell epitope vaccine. The vaccine protein sequence
      expression and translation were analyzed in the prokaryotic vector adapted by
      codon usage. Such in silico formulated CTL T-cell-based prophylactic vaccines
      could encourage the commercial development of dengue vaccines.

AB  - T-cells play an essential role in the adaptive immune system by seeking out,
      binding and destroying foreign antigens presented on the cell surface of diseased
      cells. An improved understanding of T-cell immunity will greatly aid in the
      development of new cancer immunotherapies and vaccines for life threatening
      pathogens. Central to the design of such targeted therapies are computational
      methods to predict non-native epitopes to elicit a T cell response, however, we
      currently lack accurate immunogenicity inference methods. Another challenge is
      the ability to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides for specific human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, for both synthetic biological applications and
      to augment real training datasets. Here, we proposed a beta-binomial distribution
      approach to derive epitope immunogenic potential from sequence alone. We
      conducted systematic benchmarking of five traditional machine learning
      (ElasticNet, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost) and three deep learning models
      (CNN, ResNet, GNN) using three independent prior validated immunogenic peptide
      collections (dengue virus, cancer neoantigen and SARS-Cov-2). We chose the CNN
      model as the best prediction model based on its adaptivity for small and large
      datasets, and performance relative to existing methods. In addition to
      outperforming two highly used immunogenicity prediction algorithms, DeepHLApan
      and IEDB, DeepImmuno-CNN further correctly predicts which residues are most
      important for T cell antigen recognition. Our independent generative adversarial 
      network (GAN) approach, DeepImmuno-GAN, was further able to accurately simulate
      immunogenic peptides with physiochemical properties and immunogenicity
      predictions similar to that of real antigens. We provide DeepImmuno-CNN as source
      code and an easy-to-use web interface. Data Availability: DeepImmuno Python3 code

TI  - Egg data validation in quantitative monitoring of Aedes albopictus in
      Emilia-Romagna region, Italy.

AB  - The monitoring of Aedes urban species is usually conducted by ovitraps, which can
      provide a good estimate of population density at low cost and relatively easy
      management. When the monitoring network is managed by many operators, as in the
      case of the Emilia-Romagna regional plan, it becomes necessary to develop a
      quality control methodology capable of highlighting the possible data incoherency
      and ensuring that the monitoring system provides reliable data.This paper
      presents the procedure applied in the egg counting phase as developed in
      Emilia-Romagna in order to check the data quality and validate the data before
      being included in the database.Several steps have been identified and protocols
      developed to serve quality control such as training of technicians and
      intralaboratory quality check, daily random double counting of Masonite paddles
      and interlaboratory periodic comparison.The qualitative test showed that all
      operators were able to distinguish Aedes albopictus eggs from other mosquito
      species eggs. The quantitative test showed significant differences between the 11
      operators, with a relative error resulting in the range of 0.1-25.8%.The daily
      internal double counting of randomly extracted Masonite slides was performed by
      the coordinator showing a relative error in the range 2.47-2.63% without
      statistical differences, confirming a good alignment of the operators with the
      coordinator throughout the monitoring period.The interlaboratory comparison trial
      produced an average relative error of 7.20% showing a sufficient alignment
      between the three laboratories.Moreover a new time-saving methods in egg counting
      was developed and tested in real condition.

AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has prompted the mobilization of a network of public 
      health laboratories to diagnose COVID-19 patients, trace contacts and identify
      hot-spot areas for active community transmission at the expense of arbovirus
      diagnosis and control practices. In this article, we discuss the unprecedented
      challenges faced by the Brazilian public health system in dealing with the
      incursion of SARS-CoV-2 in the midst of ongoing triple arboviral epidemics caused
      by dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus. Finally, we highlight the importance of
      the introduction of one health approach as an effective inter-disciplinary
      response and management to mitigate the catastrophic effect caused by these
      pathogens.

TI  - Assessing the risk of dengue severity using demographic information and
      laboratory test results with machine learning.
PG  - e0008960
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008960 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus causes a wide spectrum of disease, which ranges from
      subclinical disease to severe dengue shock syndrome. However, estimating the risk
      of severe outcomes using clinical presentation or laboratory test results for
      rapid patient triage remains a challenge. Here, we aimed to develop prognostic
      models for severe dengue using machine learning, according to demographic
      information and clinical laboratory data of patients with dengue.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Out of 1,581 patients in the National Cheng Kung 
      University Hospital with suspected dengue infections and subjected to NS1
      antigen, IgM and IgG, and qRT-PCR tests, 798 patients including 138 severe cases 
      were enrolled in the study. The primary target outcome was severe dengue. Machine
      learning models were trained and tested using the patient dataset that included
      demographic information and qualitative laboratory test results collected on day 
      1 when they sought medical advice. To develop prognostic models, we applied
      various machine learning methods, including logistic regression, random forest,
      gradient boosting machine, support vector classifier, and artificial neural
      network, and compared the performance of the methods. The artificial neural
      network showed the highest average discrimination area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve (0.8324 +/- 0.0268) and balance accuracy (0.7523
      +/- 0.0273). According to the model explainer that analyzed the
      contributions/co-contributions of the different factors, patient age and dengue
      NS1 antigenemia were the two most important risk factors associated with severe
      dengue. Additionally, co-existence of anti-dengue IgM and IgG in patients with
      dengue increased the probability of severe dengue. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We
      developed prognostic models for the prediction of dengue severity in patients,
      using machine learning. The discriminative ability of the artificial neural
      network exhibited good performance for severe dengue prognosis. This model could 
      help clinicians obtain a rapid prognosis during dengue outbreaks. However, the
      model requires further validation using external cohorts in future studies.

TI  - Enhancing fine-grained intra-urban dengue forecasting by integrating spatial
      interactions of human movements between urban regions.
PG  - e0008924
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008924 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As a mosquito-borne infectious disease, dengue fever (DF) has spread 
      through tropical and subtropical regions worldwide in recent decades. Dengue
      forecasting is essential for enhancing the effectiveness of preventive measures. 
      Current studies have been primarily conducted at national, sub-national, and city
      levels, while an intra-urban dengue forecasting at a fine spatial resolution
      still remains a challenging feat. As viruses spread rapidly because of a highly
      dynamic population flow, integrating spatial interactions of human movements
      between regions would be potentially beneficial for intra-urban dengue
      forecasting. METHODOLOGY: In this study, a new framework for enhancing
      intra-urban dengue forecasting was developed by integrating the spatial
      interactions between urban regions. First, a graph-embedding technique called
      Node2Vec was employed to learn the embeddings (in the form of an N-dimensional
      real-valued vector) of the regions from their population flow network. As
      strongly interacting regions would have more similar embeddings, the embeddings
      can serve as "interaction features." Then, the interaction features were combined
      with those commonly used features (e.g., temperature, rainfall, and population)
      to enhance the supervised learning-based dengue forecasting models at a
      fine-grained intra-urban scale. RESULTS: The performance of forecasting models
      (i.e., SVM, LASSO, and ANN) integrated with and without interaction features was 
      tested and compared on township-level dengue forecasting in Guangzhou, the most
      threatened sub-tropical city in China. Results showed that models using both
      common and interaction features can achieve better performance than that using
      common features alone. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach for incorporating
      spatial interactions of human movements using graph-embedding technique is
      effective, which can help enhance fine-grained intra-urban dengue forecasting.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results obtained by a surveillance network on
      arbovirosis composed by doctors and nurses located at hospitals and Primary Care 
      trained in their identification, diagnostic confirmation and clinical management.
      LOCATION: North Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (1,400,000 inhabitants; Catalonia;
      Spain) during a calendar year. PARTICIPANTS: Seven Primary Care and 10 hospital
      physicians plus 4 Primary Care nurses. TYPE OF STUDY: A prospective observational
      study. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Demographic, epidemiological (autochthonous/imported,
      suspect/probable/confirmed case) and healthcare variables (symptoms, serological 
      profile, viral period) were defined. RESULTS: Of the 34 patients identified, 26
      (76.5%) met study criteria. Among them, any arbovirosis was confirmed in 14
      (53.8%): 13 dengue plus 1chikungunya fever. There were no cases of Zika fever.
      There was a history of travel to endemic areas 23 (88.4%), but not in 3cases
      (11.6%) in which the possibility of an indigenous transmission was considered; of
      them, a case of dengue was confirmed. The estimated incidence of arbovirosis was 
      0.4 (95%CI: 0.33-0.51) cases x10,000hab/year which, when compared to the
      estimated incidence in the same geographical area during the period 2009-2013
      (0.19cases x10,000hab/year; 95%CI: 0.07-0.31), a significant increase was found
      (P=.044). Patients within viremia period at the time of their first medical visit
      were 11 (42.3%). CONCLUSIONS: An intensified epidemiological surveillance program
      defined at Primary Care and hospital levels is able to detect significantly more 
      cases of imported and autochthonous arbovirosis. Possibly we are witnessing an
      increase in the incidence of imported arbovirosis and, thus, measures aimed at
      their identification and confirmation should be reinforced.

TI  - Dengue, chikungunya and Zika in GeoSentinel surveillance of international
      travellers: a literature review from 1995 to 2020.
LID - taaa222 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jtm/taaa222 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: GeoSentinel is a global surveillance network of travel medicine
      providers seeing ill-returned travellers. Much of our knowledge on health
      problems and infectious encountered by international travellers has evolved as a 
      result of GeoSentinel surveillance, providing geographic and temporal trends in
      morbidity among travellers while contributing to improved pre-travel advice. We
      set out to synthesize epidemiological information, clinical manifestations and
      time trends for dengue, chikungunya and Zika in travellers as captured by
      GeoSentinel. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed on
      international travellers who presented with dengue, chikungunya or Zika virus
      infections to GeoSentinel sites around the world from 1995 until 2020. RESULTS:
      Of 107 GeoSentinel publications, 42 articles were related to dengue, chikungunya 
      and/or Zika. The final analyses and synthesis of and results presented here are
      based on the findings from 27 original articles covering the three arboviral
      diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue is the most frequent arboviral disease encountered 
      in travellers presenting to GeoSentinel sites, with increasing trends over the
      past two decades. In Southeast Asia, annual proportionate morbidity increased
      from 50 dengue cases per 1000 ill returned travellers in non-epidemic years to an
      average of 159 cases per 1000 travellers during epidemic years. The highest
      number of travellers with chikungunya virus infections was reported during the
      chikungunya outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean in the years 2013-16. Zika
      was first reported by GeoSentinel already in 2012, but notifications peaked in
      the years 2016-17 reflecting the public health emergency in the Americas at the
      time.

AB  - Phosphatidylserine (PS) is an anionic phospholipid that is usually localized in
      the inner leaflets of the plasma membrane. However, the enzyme scramblase
      catalyzes the externalization of PS on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane
      during apoptosis or cellular stress. This event prompts the recognition of PS
      displaying cells by phagocytes leading to "apoptotic clearance." Multiple PS
      receptors (PSRs) mediate this process including members from the TAM (Tyro3, Axl,
      Mertk) receptor Tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by interacting with PS via bridging
      proteins like Gas6 and ProS1. Ironically, this network (PS/TAM) that evolved for 
      boosting cellular health through clearance of apoptotic and necrotic cells, has
      been manoeuvred by pathogens and tumor cells using "apoptotic mimicry." Enveloped
      viruses, responsible for most of the lethal epidemics and pandemics including the
      current SARS-CoV2 outbreak, have employed apoptotic mimicry to their advantage.
      In the current chapter, we summarize the existing knowledge regarding the
      involvement of PS/Gas6, ProS1/TAM in facilitating infectivity in a diverse set of
      cell lines, animals as well as organoids. This network executes a largely
      proviral role in facilitating infection as seen with Zika, Ebola, Influenza and
      Dengue viruses. However, this response varies with strains and the cells
      infected, and in some cases, this same signaling displays an antiviral function. 
      We also report multiple studies that have used neutralizing antibodies and small 
      molecule inhibitors in successfully reducing viral replication and ameliorating
      pathogenicity. Knowledge about this unique signaling pathway and measures that
      can be taken to inhibit it is most valuable now given how enveloped viruses lead 
      to plagues on the entire globe.

TI  - Chemical targeting of NEET proteins reveals their function in mitochondrial
      morphodynamics.
PG  - e49019
LID - 10.15252/embr.201949019 [doi]
AB  - Several human pathologies including neurological, cardiac, infectious, cancerous,
      and metabolic diseases have been associated with altered mitochondria
      morphodynamics. Here, we identify a small organic molecule, which we named
      Mito-C. Mito-C is targeted to mitochondria and rapidly provokes mitochondrial
      network fragmentation. Biochemical analyses reveal that Mito-C is a member of a
      new class of heterocyclic compounds that target the NEET protein family,
      previously reported to regulate mitochondrial iron and ROS homeostasis. One of
      the NEET proteins, NAF-1, is identified as an important regulator of mitochondria
      morphodynamics that facilitates recruitment of DRP1 to the ER-mitochondria
      interface. Consistent with the observation that certain viruses modulate
      mitochondrial morphogenesis as a necessary part of their replication cycle,
      Mito-C counteracts dengue virus-induced mitochondrial network hyperfusion and
      represses viral replication. The newly identified chemical class including Mito-C
      is of therapeutic relevance for pathologies where altered mitochondria dynamics
      is part of disease etiology and NEET proteins are highlighted as important
      therapeutic targets in anti-viral research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: First Zika virus (ZIKV) positive case from North India was detected
      on routine surveillance of Dengue-Like Illness in an 85-year old female.
      Objective of the study was to conduct an investigation for epidemiological,
      clinical and genomic analysis of first ZIKV outbreak in Rajasthan, North India
      and enhance routine ZIKV surveillance. METHOD: Outbreak investigation was
      performed in 3 Km radius of the index case among patient contacts, febrile cases,
      and pregnant women. Routine surveillance was enhanced to include samples from
      various districts of Rajasthan. Presence of ZIKV in serum and urine samples was
      detected by real time PCR test and CDC trioplex kit. Few ZIKV positive samples
      were sequenced using the next-generation sequencing method for genomic analysis. 
      RESULT: On outbreak investigation 153/2043 (7.48%) cases were found positive:
      1/153 (0.65%) among contacts, 90/153 (58.8%) in fever cases, 62/153(40.5%) in
      pregnant females. In routine surveillance, 6/4722 (0.12%) serum samples were ZIKV
      positive.Majority of patients had mild signs and symptoms, no case of
      microcephaly and Guillain- Barre Syndrome was seen, 25 (40.3%) pregnant females
      delivered healthy babies, four (6.4%) reported abortion and three (4.8%) had
      intrauterine death, one (1.6%) child had colorectal malformation and died after
      few days of birth. ZIKV was found to belong to Asian lineage, mutation related to
      enhanced neuro-virulence and transmission in animal models was not found.
      CONCLUSION: ZIKV was endogenous to India belonging to Asian Lineage. Disease
      profile of the ZIKV was asymptomatic to mild. No major anomaly was observed in
      infants born to ZIKV positive mothers; however, long term follow up of these
      children is required. There is need to scale up surveillance in the virology lab 
      network of India for early detection and control. SUMMARY LINE: Zika virus
      infection was endogenous due to Asian Lineage with mild disease, no case of
      microcephaly or Guillain- Barre Syndrome was seen but children need to be
      followed for anomalies and surveillance of ZIKV needs to be enhanced in the
      country.

TI  - Travel-related infections presenting in Europe: A 20-year analysis of EuroTravNet
      surveillance data.
PG  - 100001
LID - 10.1016/j.lanepe.2020.100001 [doi]
AB  - Background: Disease epidemiology of (re-)emerging infectious diseases is changing
      rapidly, rendering surveillance of travel-associated illness important. Methods: 
      We evaluated travel-related illness encountered at EuroTravNet clinics, the
      European surveillance sub-network of GeoSentinel, between March 1, 1998 and March
      31, 2018. Findings: 103,739 ill travellers were evaluated, including 11,239
      (10.8%) migrants, 89,620 (86.4%) patients seen post-travel, and 2,880 (2.8%)
      during and after travel. Despite increasing numbers of patient encounters over 20
      years, the regions of exposure by year of clinic visits have remained stable. In 
      5-year increments, greater proportions of patients were migrants or visiting
      friends and relatives (VFR); business travel-associated illness remained stable; 
      tourism-related illness decreased. Falciparum malaria was amongst the
      most-frequently diagnosed illnesses with 5,254 cases (5.1% of all patients) and
      the most-frequent cause of death (risk ratio versus all other illnesses 2.5:1).
      Animal exposures requiring rabies post-exposure prophylaxis increased from 0.7%
      (1998-2002) to 3.6% (2013-2018). The proportion of patients with seasonal
      influenza increased from zero in 1998-2002 to 0.9% in 2013-2018. There were 44
      cases of viral haemorrhagic fever, most during the past five years. Arboviral
      infection numbers increased significantly as did the range of presenting
      arboviral diseases, dengue and chikungunya diagnoses increased by 2.6% and 1%,
      respectively. Interpretation: Travel medicine must adapt to serve the changing
      profile of travellers, with an increase in migrants and persons visiting
      relatives and friends and the strong emergence of vector-borne diseases, with
      potential for further local transmission in Europe. Funding: This project was
      supported by a cooperative agreement (U50CK00189) between the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention to the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM) and
      funding from the ISTM and the Public Health Agency of Canada.

TI  - Comparing machine learning with case-control models to identify confirmed dengue 
      cases.
PG  - e0008843
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008843 [doi]
AB  - In recent decades, the global incidence of dengue has increased. Affected
      countries have responded with more effective surveillance strategies to detect
      outbreaks early, monitor the trends, and implement prevention and control
      measures. We have applied newly developed machine learning approaches to identify
      laboratory-confirmed dengue cases from 4,894 emergency department patients with
      dengue-like illness (DLI) who received laboratory tests. Among them, 60.11% (2942
      cases) were confirmed to have dengue. Using just four input variables [age, body 
      temperature, white blood cells counts (WBCs) and platelets], not only the
      state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) prediction models but also the
      conventional decision tree (DT) and logistic regression (LR) models delivered
      performances with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves areas under
      curves (AUCs) of the ranging from 83.75% to 85.87% [for DT, DNN and LR: 84.60%
      +/- 0.03%, 85.87% +/- 0.54%, 83.75% +/- 0.17%, respectively]. Subgroup analyses
      found all the models were very sensitive particularly in the pre-epidemic period.
      Pre-peak sensitivities (<35 weeks) were 92.6%, 92.9%, and 93.1% in DT, DNN, and
      LR respectively. Adjusted odds ratios examined with LR for low WBCs [</= 3.2
      (x103/muL)], fever (>/=38 degrees C), low platelet counts [< 100 (x103/muL)], and
      elderly (>/= 65 years) were 5.17 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.96-6.76], 3.17 
      [95%CI: 2.74-3.66], 3.10 [95%CI: 2.44-3.94], and 1.77 [95%CI: 1.50-2.10],
      respectively. Our prediction models can readily be used in resource-poor
      countries where viral/serologic tests are inconvenient and can also be applied
      for real-time syndromic surveillance to monitor trends of dengue cases and even
      be integrated with mosquito/environment surveillance for early warning and
      immediate prevention/control measures. In other words, a local community
      hospital/clinic with an instrument of complete blood counts (including platelets)
      can provide a sentinel screening during outbreaks. In conclusion, the machine
      learning approach can facilitate medical and public health efforts to minimize
      the health threat of dengue epidemics. However, laboratory confirmation remains
      the primary goal of surveillance and outbreak investigation.

AB  - Routine biosurveillance efforts at the Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 18 
      June 2019, detected two unusual mosquitos in a CO2-baited CDC light trap.
      Morphological and molecular analysis confirmed the presence of Aedes
      (Fredwardsius) vittatus (Bigot, 1861) - the first record of the Old World dengue,
      chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever virus vector into the Americas - and provides 
      evidence for its establishment in Cuba. Newly submitted GenBank sequences from
      Dominican Republic further evidence its establishment in the Caribbean, and a
      median-joining network analysis using mitochondrial COI gene sequences clearly
      supports multiple introductions of Ae. vittatus into the Caribbean from the
      Indian subcontinent. It was determined that many Ae. vittatus COI barcode
      sequences in GenBank are currently misidentified as Aedes (Fredwardsius) cogilli 
      Edwards, 1922.

AB  - Effective management of seasonal diseases such as dengue fever depends on timely 
      deployment of control measures prior to the high transmission season. As the
      epidemic season fluctuates from year to year, the availability of accurate
      forecasts of incidence can be decisive in attaining control of such diseases.
      Obtaining such forecasts from classical time series models has proven a difficult
      task. Here we propose and compare machine learning models incorporating feature
      selection,such as LASSO and Random Forest regression with LSTM a deep recurrent
      neural network, to forecast weekly dengue incidence in 790 cities in Brazil. We
      use multivariate time-series as predictors and also utilize time series from
      similar cities to capture the spatial component of disease transmission. The LSTM
      recurrent neural network model attained the highest performance in predicting
      future incidence on dengue in cities of different sizes.

TI  - Predicting dengue outbreaks at neighbourhood level using human mobility in urban 
      areas.
PG  - 20200691
LID - 10.1098/rsif.2020.0691 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a vector-borne disease transmitted by the Aedes genus mosquito. It
      causes financial burdens on public health systems and considerable morbidity and 
      mortality. Tropical regions in the Americas and Asia are the areas most affected 
      by the virus. Fortaleza is a city with approximately 2.6 million inhabitants in
      northeastern Brazil that, during the recent decades, has been suffering from
      endemic dengue transmission, interspersed with larger epidemics. The objective of
      this paper is to study the impact of human mobility in urban areas on the spread 
      of the dengue virus, and to test whether human mobility data can be used to
      improve predictions of dengue virus transmission at the neighbourhood level. We
      present two distinct forecasting systems for dengue transmission in Fortaleza:
      the first using artificial neural network methods and the second developed using 
      a mechanistic model of disease transmission. We then present enhanced versions of
      the two forecasting systems that incorporate bus transportation data cataloguing 
      movement among 119 neighbourhoods in Fortaleza. Each forecasting system was used 
      to perform retrospective forecasts for historical dengue outbreaks from 2007 to
      2015. Results show that both artificial neural networks and mechanistic models
      can accurately forecast dengue cases, and that the inclusion of human mobility
      data substantially improves the performance of both forecasting systems. While
      the mechanistic models perform better in capturing seasons with large-scale
      outbreaks, the neural networks more accurately forecast outbreak peak timing,
      peak intensity and annual dengue time series. These results have two practical
      implications: they support the creation of public policies from the use of the
      models created here to combat the disease and help to understand the impact of
      urban mobility on the epidemic in large cities.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a
      pandemic with growing global mortality. There is an urgent need to understand the
      molecular pathways required for host infection and anti-viral immunity. Using
      comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry
      (ChIRP-MS), we identified 309 host proteins that bind the SARS-CoV-2 RNA during
      active infection. Integration of this data with viral ChIRP-MS data from three
      other positive-sense RNA viruses defined pan-viral and SARS-CoV-2-specific host
      interactions. Functional interrogation of these factors with a genome-wide CRISPR
      screen revealed that the vast majority of viral RNA-binding proteins protect the 
      host from virus-induced cell death, and we identified known and novel anti-viral 
      proteins that regulate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Finally, our RNA-centric
      approach demonstrated a physical connection between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and host
      mitochondria, which we validated with functional and electron microscopy data,
      providing new insights into a more general virus-specific protein logic for
      mitochondrial interactions. Altogether, these data provide a comprehensive
      catalogue of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-host protein interactions, which may inform future
      studies to understand the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis, as well as nominate
      host pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic benefit. Highlights: .
      ChIRP-MS of SARS-CoV-2 RNA identifies a comprehensive viral RNA-host protein
      interaction network during infection across two species. Comparison to
      RNA-protein interaction networks with Zika virus, dengue virus, and rhinovirus
      identify SARS-CoV-2-specific and pan-viral RNA protein complexes and highlights
      distinct intracellular trafficking pathways. Intersection of ChIRP-MS and
      genome-wide CRISPR screens identify novel SARS-CoV-2-binding proteins with pro-
      and anti-viral function. Viral RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions reveal
      specific SARS-CoV-2-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction during infection.

TI  - Optimal Scree-CNN for Detecting NS1 Molecular Fingerprint from Salivary SERS
      Spectra.
PG  - 180-183

AB  - Dengue fever (DF) is a viral infection with possible fatal consequence. NS1 is a 
      recent antigen based biomarker for dengue fever (DF), as an alternative to
      current serum and antibody based biomarkers. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
      has demonstrated impressive performance in machine learning problems. Our
      previous research has captured NS1 molecular fingerprint in saliva using Surface 
      Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) with great potential as an early, noninvasive 
      detection method. SERS is an enhanced variant of Raman spectroscopy, with
      extremely high amplification that enables spectra of low concentration matter,
      such as NS1 in saliva, readable. The spectrum contains 1801 features per sample, 
      at a total of 284 samples. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transforms high
      dimensional correlated signal to a lower dimension uncorrelated principal
      components (PCs), at no sacrifice of the original signal content. This paper aims
      to unravel an optimal Scree-CNN model for classification of salivary NS1 SERS
      spectra. Performances of a total of 490 classifier models were examined and
      compared in terms of performance indicators [accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, 
      precision, kappa] against a WHO recommended clinical standard test for DF,
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Effects of CNN parameters on
      performances of the classifier models were also observed. Results showed that
      Scree-CNN classifier model with learning rate of 0.01, mini-batch size of 64 and 
      validation frequency of 50, reported an across-the-board 100% for all performance
      indicators.

TI  - A Novel Strategy for the Development of Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and
      Other Viruses Using AI and Viral Shell Disorder.
PG  - 4355-4363
LID - 10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00672 [doi]
AB  - A model that predicts levels of coronavirus (CoV) respiratory and fecal-oral
      transmission potentials based on the shell disorder has been built using neural
      network (artificial intelligence, AI) analysis of the percentage of disorder
      (PID) in the nucleocapsid, N, and membrane, M, proteins of the inner and outer
      viral shells, respectively. Using primarily the PID of N, SARS-CoV-2 is grouped
      as having intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission
      potentials. Related studies, using similar methodologies, have found strong
      positive correlations between virulence and inner shell disorder among numerous
      viruses, including Nipah, Ebola, and Dengue viruses. There is some evidence that 
      this is also true for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which have N PIDs of 48% and 50%, 
      and case-fatality rates of 0.5-5% and 10.9%, respectively. The underlying
      relationship between virulence and respiratory potentials has to do with the
      viral loads of vital organs and body fluids, respectively. Viruses can spread by 
      respiratory means only if the viral loads in saliva and mucus exceed certain
      minima. Similarly, a patient is likelier to die when the viral load overwhelms
      vital organs. Greater disorder in inner shell proteins has been known to play
      important roles in the rapid replication of viruses by enhancing the efficiency
      pertaining to protein-protein/DNA/RNA/lipid bindings. This paper suggests a novel
      strategy in attenuating viruses involving comparison of disorder patterns of
      inner shells (N) of related viruses to identify residues and regions that could
      be ideal for mutation. The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 has one of the lowest M PID
      values (6%) in its family, and therefore, this virus has one of the hardest outer
      shells, which makes it resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluid. While
      this is likely responsible for its greater contagiousness, the risks of creating 
      an attenuated virus with a more disordered M are discussed.

TI  - Dengue Virus Targets Nrf2 for NS2B3-Mediated Degradation Leading to Enhanced
      Oxidative Stress and Viral Replication.
LID - e01551-20 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01551-20 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that infects upward of 300 million 
      people annually and has the potential to cause fatal hemorrhagic fever and shock.
      While the parameters contributing to dengue immunopathogenesis remain unclear,
      the collapse of redox homeostasis and the damage induced by oxidative stress have
      been correlated with the development of inflammation and progression toward the
      more severe forms of disease. In the present study, we demonstrate that the
      accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) late after DENV infection (>24 hpi)
      resulted from a disruption in the balance between oxidative stress and the
      nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidant
      response. The DENV NS2B3 protease complex strategically targeted Nrf2 for
      degradation in a proteolysis-independent manner; NS2B3 licensed Nrf2 for
      lysosomal degradation. Impairment of the Nrf2 regulator by the NS2B3 complex
      inhibited the antioxidant gene network and contributed to the progressive
      increase in ROS levels, along with increased virus replication and inflammatory
      or apoptotic gene expression. By 24 hpi, when increased levels of ROS and
      antiviral proteins were observed, it appeared that the proviral effect of ROS
      overcame the antiviral effects of the interferon (IFN) response. Overall, these
      studies demonstrate that DENV infection disrupts the regulatory interplay between
      DENV-induced stress responses, Nrf2 antioxidant signaling, and the host antiviral
      immune response, thus exacerbating oxidative stress and inflammation in DENV
      infection.IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that
      threatens 2.5 billion people in more than 100 countries annually. Dengue
      infection induces a spectrum of clinical symptoms, ranging from classical dengue 
      fever to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome; however, the
      complexities of DENV immunopathogenesis remain controversial. Previous studies
      have reported the importance of the transcription factor Nrf2 in the control of
      redox homeostasis and antiviral/inflammatory or death responses to DENV.
      Importantly, the production of reactive oxygen species and the subsequent stress 
      response have been linked to the development of inflammation and progression
      toward the more severe forms of the disease. Here, we demonstrate that DENV uses 
      the NS2B3 protease complex to strategically target Nrf2 for degradation, leading 
      to a progressive increase in oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death in
      infected cells. This study underlines the pivotal role of the Nrf2 regulatory
      network in the context of DENV infection.

TI  - Surveillance of Aedes aegypti populations in the city of Praia, Cape Verde: Zika 
      virus infection, insecticide resistance and genetic diversity.
PG  - 481
LID - 10.1186/s13071-020-04356-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes spp. are responsible for the transmission of many arboviruses, 
      which contribute to rising human morbidity and mortality worldwide. The Aedes
      aegypti mosquito is a main vector for chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever
      infections, whose incidence have been increasing and distribution expanding. This
      vector has also driven the emergence of the Zika virus (ZIKV), first reported in 
      Africa which spread rapidly to Asia and more recently across the Americas. During
      the outbreak in the Americas, Cape Verde became the first African country
      declaring a Zika epidemic, with confirmed cases of microcephaly. Here we
      investigate the prevalence of ZIKV and dengue (DENV) infected Ae. aegypti
      mosquitoes in the weeks following the outbreak in Cape Verde, and the presence of
      insecticide resistance in the circulating vector population. Genetic diversity in
      the mosquito population was also analysed. METHODS: From August to October 2016, 
      816 Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were collected in several locations across Praia, Cape
      Verde, the major hot spot of reported ZIKV cases in the country. All mosquitoes
      were screened by reverse transcription PCR for ZIKV and DENV, and a subset (n =
      220) were screened for knockdown insecticide resistance associated mutations in
      the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene by capillary sequencing. The
      mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (nad4) gene was sequenced in 100
      mosquitoes. These data were compared to 977 global sequences in a haplotype
      network and a phylogenetic tree analysis. RESULTS: Two Ae. aegypti mosquitoes
      were ZIKV positive (0.25%). There were no SNP mutations found in the VGSC gene
      associated with insecticide resistance. Analysis of the nad4 gene revealed 11
      haplotypes in the Cape Verdean samples, with 5 being singletons. Seven haplotypes
      were exclusive to Cape Verde. Several of the remaining haplotypes were frequent
      in the global dataset, being present in several countries (including Cape Verde) 
      across five different continents. The most common haplotype in Cape Verde (50.6
      %) was also found in Africa and South America. CONCLUSIONS: There was low-level
      Zika virus circulation in mosquitoes from Praia shortly after the outbreak. The
      Ae. aegypti population did not appear to have the kdr mutations associated with
      pyrethroid resistance. Furthermore, haplotype and phylogenetic analyses revealed 
      that Cape Verde Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are most closely related to those from
      other countries in Africa and South America.

AB  - Most of the recent epidemic outbreaks in the world have as a trigger, a strong
      migratory component as has been evident in the recent Covid-19 pandemic. In this 
      work we address the problem of migration of human populations and its effect on
      pathogen reinfections in the case of Dengue, using a Markov-chain
      susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) metapopulation model over a network. Our
      model postulates a general contact rate that represents a local measure of
      several factors: the population size of infected hosts that arrive at a given
      location as a function of total population size, the current incidence at
      neighboring locations, and the connectivity of the network where the disease
      spreads. This parameter can be interpreted as an indicator of outbreak risk at a 
      given location. This parameter is tied to the fraction of individuals that move
      across boundaries (migration). To illustrate our model capabilities, we estimate 
      from epidemic Dengue data in Mexico the dynamics of migration at a regional scale
      incorporating climate variability represented by an index based on precipitation 
      data.

TI  - Representation of EHR data for predictive modeling: a comparison between UMLS and
      other terminologies.
PG  - 1593-1599
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa180 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Predictive disease modeling using electronic health record data is a
      growing field. Although clinical data in their raw form can be used directly for 
      predictive modeling, it is a common practice to map data to standard
      terminologies to facilitate data aggregation and reuse. There is, however, a lack
      of systematic investigation of how different representations could affect the
      performance of predictive models, especially in the context of machine learning
      and deep learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We projected the input diagnoses data
      in the Cerner HealthFacts database to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and 
      5 other terminologies, including CCS, CCSR, ICD-9, ICD-10, and PheWAS, and
      evaluated the prediction performances of these terminologies on 2 different
      tasks: the risk prediction of heart failure in diabetes patients and the risk
      prediction of pancreatic cancer. Two popular models were evaluated: logistic
      regression and a recurrent neural network. RESULTS: For logistic regression,
      using UMLS delivered the optimal area under the receiver operating
      characteristics (AUROC) results in both dengue hemorrhagic fever (81.15%) and
      pancreatic cancer (80.53%) tasks. For recurrent neural network, UMLS worked best 
      for pancreatic cancer prediction (AUROC 82.24%), second only (AUROC 85.55%) to
      PheWAS (AUROC 85.87%) for dengue hemorrhagic fever prediction.
      DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: In our experiments, terminologies with larger vocabularies
      and finer-grained representations were associated with better prediction
      performances. In particular, UMLS is consistently 1 of the best-performing ones. 
      We believe that our work may help to inform better designs of predictive models, 
      although further investigation is warranted.

TI  - Trends of the Dengue Serotype-4 Circulation with Epidemiological, Phylogenetic,
      and Entomological Insights in Lao PDR between 2015 and 2019.
LID - E728 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens9090728 [doi]
AB  - Dengue outbreaks have regularly been recorded in Lao People's Democratic Republic
      (PDR) since the first detection of the disease in 1979. In 2012, an integrated
      arbovirus surveillance network was set up in Lao PDR and an entomological
      surveillance has been implemented since 2016 in Vientiane Capital. Here, we
      report a study combining epidemiological, phylogenetic, and entomological
      analyzes during the largest DENV-4 epidemic ever recorded in Lao PDR (2015-2019).
      Strikingly, from 2015 to 2019, we reported the DENV-4 emergence and spread at the
      country level after two large epidemics predominated by DENV-3 and DENV-1,
      respectively, in 2012-2013 and 2015. Our data revealed a significant difference
      in the median age of the patient infected by DENV-4 compared to the other
      serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the circulation of DENV-4 Genotype 
      I at the country level since at least 2013. The entomological surveillance showed
      a predominance of Aedesaegypti compared to Aedesalbopictus and high abundance of 
      these vectors in dry and rainy seasons between 2016 and 2019, in Vientiane
      Capital. Overall, these results emphasized the importance of an integrated
      approach to evaluate factors, which could impact the circulation and the
      epidemiological profile of dengue viruses, especially in endemic countries like
      Lao PDR.

PG  - e1008136
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008136 [doi]
AB  - Management strategies for control of vector-borne diseases, for example Zika or
      dengue, include using larvicide and/or adulticide, either through large-scale
      application by truck or plane or through door-to-door efforts that require
      obtaining permission to access private property and spray yards. The efficacy of 
      the latter strategy is highly dependent on the compliance of local residents.
      Here we develop a model for vector-borne disease transmission between mosquitoes 
      and humans in a neighborhood setting, considering a network of houses connected
      via nearest-neighbor mosquito movement. We incorporate large-scale application of
      adulticide via aerial spraying through a uniform increase in vector death rates
      in all sites, and door-to-door application of larval source reduction and
      adulticide through a decrease in vector emergence rates and an increase in vector
      death rates in compliant sites only, where control efficacies are directly
      connected to real-world experimentally measurable control parameters, application
      frequencies, and control costs. To develop mechanistic insight into the influence
      of vector motion and compliance clustering on disease controllability, we
      determine the basic reproduction number R0 for the system, provide analytic
      results for the extreme cases of no mosquito movement, infinite hopping rates,
      and utilize degenerate perturbation theory for the case of slow but non-zero
      hopping rates. We then determine the application frequencies required for each
      strategy (alone and combined) in order to reduce R0 to unity, along with the
      associated costs. Cost-optimal strategies are found to depend strongly on
      mosquito hopping rates, levels of door-to-door compliance, and spatial clustering
      of compliant houses, and can include aerial spray alone, door-to-door treatment
      alone, or a combination of both. The optimization scheme developed here provides 
      a flexible tool for disease management planners which translates modeling results
      into actionable control advice adaptable to system-specific details.

TI  - Association of dengue disease severity and blood group: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1002/rmv.2147 [doi]
AB  - Dengue disease encompasses various clinical manifestations including dengue fever
      (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). In this article, we aimed to
      systematically review and analyze the association between different blood groups 
      and severity of dengue. We searched nine databases for eligible papers reporting 
      prevalence, distribution, and frequency of blood group type among dengue
      patients. Network meta-analysis using R software was used to analyze the data. Of
      a total of 63 reports screened, we included 10 studies with total sample size
      1977 patients (1382 DF and 595 DHF). Blood group O was found to have the worst
      outcome with the highest risk of developing DF (P-score = 0.01) followed by group
      B (P-score = 0.34), group A (P-score = 0.64), and group AB (P-score = 1),
      respectively. Blood group O also had the worst outcome with highest risk of
      developing DHF (P-score = 0.1) followed by group B (P-score = 0.29), group A
      (P-score = 0.61), and group AB (P-score = 1), respectively. There was a
      significant increase (P-value <.001) in the overall odds risk of dengue infection
      among patients with Rhesus-positive blood groups [OR = 540.03; (95% CI =
      151.48-1925.18)]. However, there was no significant difference in the odds risk
      of DF when compared to DHF according to Rhesus status (P-value = .954). This
      study identified the O blood group as a potential risk factor in predicting
      clinical severity in dengue patients which may be helpful in evaluating patients 
      for their likely need for critical care.

AB  - Climate change is a challenge for the sustainable development of an international
      economy and society. The impact of climate change on infectious diseases has been
      regarded as one of the most urgent research topics. In this paper, an analysis of
      the bibliometrics, co-word biclustering, and strategic diagram was performed to
      evaluate global scientific production, hotspots, and developing trends regarding 
      climate change and infectious diseases, based on the data of two decades
      (1999-2008 and 2009-2018) from PubMed. According to the search strategy and
      inclusion criteria, a total of 1443 publications were found on the topic of
      climate change and infectious diseases. There has been increasing research
      productivity in this field, which has been supported by a wide range of subject
      categories. The top highly-frequent major MeSH (medical subject
      headings)/subheading combination terms could be divided into four clusters for
      the first decade and five for the second decade using a biclustering analysis. At
      present, some significant public health challenges (global health, and travel and
      tropical climate, etc.) are at the center of the whole target research network.
      In the last ten years, "Statistical model", "Diarrhea", "Dengue", "Ecosystem and 
      biodiversity", and "Zoonoses" have been considered as emerging hotspots, but they
      still need more attention for further development.

TI  - Optimization of convolutional neural network hyperparameters for automatic
      classification of adult mosquitoes.
PG  - e0234959
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0234959 [doi]
AB  - The economic and social impacts due to diseases transmitted by mosquitoes in the 
      latest years have been significant. Currently, no specific treatment or
      commercial vaccine exists for the control and prevention of arboviruses, thereby 
      making entomological characterization fundamental in combating diseases such as
      dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The morphological identification of mosquitos
      includes a visual exam of the samples. It is time consuming and requires
      adequately trained professionals. Accordingly, the development of a new automated
      method for realizing mosquito-perception and -classification is becoming
      increasingly essential. Therefore, in this study, a computational model based on 
      a convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to extract features from the
      images of mosquitoes and then classify the species Aedes aegypti, Aedes
      albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus. In addition, the model was trained to
      detect the mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. To train CNNs to perform the automatic 
      morphological classification of mosquitoes, a dataset, which included 7,561
      images of the target mosquitoes and 1,187 images of other insects, was acquired. 
      Various neural networks, such as Xception and DenseNet, were used for developing 
      the automatic-classification model based on images. A structured optimization
      process of random search and grid search was developed to select the
      hyperparameters set and increase the accuracy of the model. In addition,
      strategies to eliminate overfitting were implemented to increase the
      generalization of the model. The optimized model, during the test phase, obtained
      the balanced accuracy (BA) of 93.5% in classifying the target mosquitoes and
      other insects and the BA of 97.3% in detecting the mosquitoes of the genus Aedes 
      in comparison to Culex. The results provide fundamental information for
      performing the automatic morphological classification of mosquito species. Using 
      a CNN-embedded entomological tool is a valuable and accessible resource for
      health workers and non-taxonomists for identifying insects that can transmit
      infectious diseases.

PG  - 221-225
LID - 10.4103/0972-9062.311774 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The Department of Health Research and the Indian Council
      of Medical Research, Government of India, have established Virus Research and
      Diagnostic Laboratory Network (VRDLN) to strengthen the laboratory capacity in
      the country for providing timely diagnosis of disease outbreaks. Fifty-one VRDLs 
      were functional as on December 2017 and had reported about dengue fever across
      Indian states. The objectives of the study were to detect space time clusters and
      purely temporal clusters of dengue using Kulldorff's SaTScan statistics using
      patient level information; and to identify regions at greater risk of developing 
      the disease using Kriging technique aggregating at district level. METHODS: A
      total of 211,432 patients from 51 VRDLs were investigated for IgM antibodies or
      NS1 antigen against dengue virus during the period from 1 January 2014 to 31
      December 2017 and among them 60,096 (28.4%) were found to be positive.
      Kulldorff's space time analysis was used to identify significant clusters over
      space and time. Kriging technique was used to interpolate dengue data for areas
      not physically sampled using the relationship in the spatial arrangement of the
      data set. Maps obtained using both the methods were overlaid to identify the
      regions at greater risk of developing the disease. RESULTS: Kulldorff Space time 
      Scan Statistics using the Bernoulli model with monthly precision revealed eight
      statistically significant clusters (P <0.001) for the time period, 1 January 2014
      to 31 December 2017. Eight significant clusters identified were districts of
      Nagpur, Jhunjhunu, Gadag, Dakshin Kannada, Kancheepuram, Sivaganga, Ernakulam and
      Malda. The purely temporal clusters occurred during the last quarter of 2015 and 
      2016. The Kriging technique identified north eastern part of the country
      (Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Manipur) and Gujarat. INTERPRETATION &
      CONCLUSION: Dengue fever has spread in all directions in the country. Hence, it
      is need of the hour to perform an in-depth investigation.

TI  - Tracing temporal and geographic distribution of resistance to pyrethroids in the 
      arboviral vector Aedes albopictus.
PG  - e0008350
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008350 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The arboviral vector Aedes albopictus became established on all
      continents except Antarctica in the past 50 years. A consequence of its rapid
      global invasion is the transmission of diseases previously confined to the
      tropics and subtropics occurring in temperate regions of the world, including the
      re-emergence of chikungunya and dengue in Europe. Application of pyrethroids is
      among the most widely-used interventions for vector control, especially in the
      presence of an arboviral outbreak. Studies are emerging that reveal phenotypic
      resistance and monitor mutations at the target site, the para sodium channel
      gene, primarily on a local scale. METHODS: A total of 512 Ae. albopictus
      mosquitoes from twelve geographic sites, including those from the native home
      range and invaded areas, were sampled between 2011 and 2018, and were analyzed at
      five codons of the para sodium channel gene with mutations predictive of
      resistance phenotype. Additionally, to test for the origin of unique kdr
      mutations in Mexico, we analyzed the genetic connectivity of southern Mexico
      mosquitoes with mosquitoes from home range, the Reunion Island, America and
      Europe. RESULTS: We detected mutations at all tested positions of the para sodium
      channel gene, with heterozygotes predominating and rare instance of double
      mutants. We observed an increase in the distribution and frequency of F1534C/L/S 
      mutations in the ancestral China population and populations in the Mediterranean 
      Greece, the appearance of the V1016G/I mutations as early as 2011 in Italy and
      mutations at position 410 and 989 in Mexico. The analyses of the distribution
      pattern of kdr alleles and haplotype network analyses showed evidence for
      multiple origins of all kdr mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Here we provide the
      most-up-to-date survey on the geographic and temporal distribution of
      pyrethroid-predictive mutations in Ae. albopictus by combining kdr genotyping on 
      current and historical samples with published data. While we confirm low levels
      of pyrethroid resistance in most analyzed samples, we find increasing frequencies
      of F1534C/S and V1016G in China and Greece or Italy, respectively. The observed
      patterns of kdr allele distribution support the hypothesis that on site emergence
      of resistance has contributed more than spread of resistance through mosquito
      migration/invasions to the current widespread of kdr alleles, emphasizing the
      importance of local surveillance programs and resistance management.

AB  - In the present report we evaluate the possible utility of the Generative
      Adversarial Networks (GANs) in mapping the chemical structural space for
      molecular property profiles, with the goal of subsequently yielding synthetic
      (artificial) samples for ligand-based molecular modeling. Two case studies are
      considered: BACE-1 (beta-Secretase 1) and DENV (Dengue Virus) inhibitory
      activities, with the former focused on data populating and the latter on data
      balancing tasks. We train GANs using subsamples extracted from datasets for each 
      bioactivity endpoint, and apply the trained networks in generating synthetic
      examples from the respective bioactivity chemical spaces. Original and synthetic 
      samples are pooled together and employed to build BACE-1 and DENV inhibitory
      activity classifiers and their performance evaluated over tenfold external
      validation sets. In both case studies, the obtained classifiers demonstrate
      satisfactory predictivity with the former yielding accuracy (ACC) and Mathew's
      correlation coefficient (MCC) values of 0.80 and 0.59, while the latter produces 
      balanced accuracy(BACC) and MCC values of 0.81 and 0.70, respectively. Moreover, 
      the statistics of these classifiers are compared with those of other models in
      the literature demonstrating comparable to better performance. These results
      suggest that GANs may be useful in mapping the chemical space for molecular
      property profiles of interest, and thus allow for the extraction of synthetic
      examples for computational modeling.

TI  - An autoencoder and artificial neural network-based method to estimate parity
      status of wild mosquitoes from near-infrared spectra.
PG  - e0234557
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0234557 [doi]
AB  - After mating, female mosquitoes need animal blood to develop their eggs. In the
      process of acquiring blood, they may acquire pathogens, which may cause different
      diseases in humans such as malaria, zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Therefore,
      knowing the parity status of mosquitoes is useful in control and evaluation of
      infectious diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, where parous mosquitoes are
      assumed to be potentially infectious. Ovary dissections, which are currently used
      to determine the parity status of mosquitoes, are very tedious and limited to few
      experts. An alternative to ovary dissections is near-infrared spectroscopy
      (NIRS), which can estimate the age in days and the infectious state of laboratory
      and semi-field reared mosquitoes with accuracies between 80 and 99%. No study has
      tested the accuracy of NIRS for estimating the parity status of wild mosquitoes. 
      In this study, we train an artificial neural network (ANN) models on NIR spectra 
      to estimate the parity status of wild mosquitoes. We use four different datasets:
      An. arabiensis collected from Minepa, Tanzania (Minepa-ARA); An. gambiae s.s
      collected from Muleba, Tanzania (Muleba-GA); An. gambiae s.s collected from
      Burkina Faso (Burkina-GA); and An.gambiae s.s from Muleba and Burkina Faso
      combined (Muleba-Burkina-GA). We train ANN models on datasets with spectra
      preprocessed according to previous protocols. We then use autoencoders to reduce 
      the spectra feature dimensions from 1851 to 10 and re-train the ANN models.
      Before the autoencoder was applied, ANN models estimated parity status of
      mosquitoes in Minepa-ARA, Muleba-GA, Burkina-GA and Muleba-Burkina-GA with
      out-of-sample accuracies of 81.9+/-2.8 (N = 274), 68.7+/-4.8 (N = 43), 80.3+/-2.0
      (N = 48), and 75.7+/-2.5 (N = 91), respectively. With the autoencoder, ANN models
      tested on out-of-sample data achieved 97.1+/-2.2% (N = 274), 89.8 +/- 1.7% (N =
      43), 93.3+/-1.2% (N = 48), and 92.7+/-1.8% (N = 91) accuracies for Minepa-ARA,
      Muleba-GA, Burkina-GA, and Muleba-Burkina-GA, respectively. These results show
      that a combination of an autoencoder and an ANN trained on NIR spectra to
      estimate the parity status of wild mosquitoes yields models that can be used as
      an alternative tool to estimate parity status of wild mosquitoes, especially
      since NIRS is a high-throughput, reagent-free, and simple-to-use technique
      compared to ovary dissections.

TI  - Predicting dengue importation into Europe, using machine learning and
      model-agnostic methods.
PG  - 9689
LID - 10.1038/s41598-020-66650-1 [doi]
AB  - The geographical spread of dengue is a global public health concern. This is
      largely mediated by the importation of dengue from endemic to non-endemic areas
      via the increasing connectivity of the global air transport network. The dynamic 
      nature and intrinsic heterogeneity of the air transport network make it
      challenging to predict dengue importation. Here, we explore the capabilities of
      state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to predict dengue importation. We
      trained four machine learning classifiers algorithms, using a 6-year historical
      dengue importation data for 21 countries in Europe and connectivity indices
      mediating importation and air transport network centrality measures. Predictive
      performance for the classifiers was evaluated using the area under the receiving 
      operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity measures. Finally,
      we applied practical model-agnostic methods, to provide an in-depth explanation
      of our optimal model's predictions on a global and local scale. Our best
      performing model achieved high predictive accuracy, with an area under the
      receiver operating characteristic score of 0.94 and a maximized sensitivity score
      of 0.88. The predictor variables identified as most important were the source
      country's dengue incidence rate, population size, and volume of air passengers.
      Network centrality measures, describing the positioning of European countries
      within the air travel network, were also influential to the predictions. We
      demonstrated the high predictive performance of a machine learning model in
      predicting dengue importation and the utility of the model-agnostic methods to
      offer a comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind the predictions.
      Similar approaches can be utilized in the development of an operational early
      warning surveillance system for dengue importation.

AB  - A homemade gold electrode is modified with a carbon nanotubes/gold nanoparticles 
      nanocomposite to perform selective and sensitive electrochemical detection of
      dengue toxin. This nanostructured composite offers a large specific surface and a
      reactive interface allowing the immobilization of biological material. Dengue
      antibodies are immobilized on gold nanoparticles via covalent bonding for dengue 
      toxin detection. The porous tridimensional network of carbon nanotubes and gold
      nanoparticles enhances the electrochemical signal and the overall performance of 
      the sensor. After optimization, the system exhibits a high sensitivity of - 0.44 
      +/- 0.01 muA per decade with wide linear range between 1 x 10(-12) and 1 x 10(-6)
      g/mL at a working potential of 0.22 V vs Ag/AgCl. The extremely low detection
      limit (3 x 10(-13) g/mL) ranks this immunosensor as one of the most efficient
      reported in the literature for the detection of recombinant viral dengue virus 2 
      NS1. This biosensor also offers good selectivity, characterized by a low response
      to various non-specific targets and assays in human serum. The outstanding
      performances and the reproducibility of the system place the biosensor developed 
      among the best candidates for future medical applications and for early diagnosis
      of dengue fever. Graphical abstract.

TI  - Emerging vaccine manufacturers are innovating for the next decade.
PG  - 100066
LID - 10.1016/j.jvacx.2020.100066 [doi]
AB  - The Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN) is a public
      health-driven alliance consisting of 43 vaccine manufacturers from 14 countries
      and territories, operating under the mandate to protect all people against known 
      and emerging infectious diseases, by improving the availability of high-quality
      vaccines globally. The Network provides a platform for organizations to come
      together regularly to share technical information, best practices and future
      prospects. DCVMN members are playing an increasingly important role in public
      health supplying over 50% of the doses of vaccines procured by UNICEF globally.
      To evaluate the progress made by Network's members, a survey consisting of 9
      questions covering three important components of the manufacturers in the network
      was created, focusing on company dedicated human resources, vaccine production,
      and research and development efforts. Results show that more vaccines from more
      manufacturers are achieving WHO Pre-qualification, with areas of focus including 
      the contributions to a Polio-free world, ending cholera, and tackling re-emerging
      diseases, such as measles. An increase by 50% of number of manufacturing
      companies holding WHO prequalified vaccines was observed from 2013 to 2019,
      strengthening open competitiveness for global vaccines supply. Notably, Network
      members have 181 vaccine projects in the research and development pipeline,
      highlighting novel vaccines against mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue,
      chikungunya and Zika, novel human papillomavirus and pneumococcal conjugated
      vaccines. This report summarizes the progressive efforts of DCVMN members to
      contribute to reducing the burden of infectious diseases globally and details
      their commitment to vaccine innovation, particularly in the past five years, in
      the context of how vaccine innovations of today will shape the fight against

TI  - Optimal control approaches for combining medicines and mosquito control in
      tackling dengue.
PG  - 181843
LID - 10.1098/rsos.181843 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a debilitating and devastating viral infection spread by mosquito
      vectors, and over half the world's population currently live at risk of dengue
      (and other flavivirus) infections. Here, we use an integrated epidemiological and
      vector ecology framework to predict optimal approaches for tackling dengue. Our
      aim is to investigate how vector control and/or vaccination strategies can be
      best combined and implemented for dengue disease control on small networks, and
      whether these optimal strategies differ under different circumstances. We show
      that a combination of vaccination programmes and the release of genetically
      modified self-limiting mosquitoes (comparable to sterile insect approaches) is
      always considered the most beneficial strategy for reducing the number of
      infected individuals, owing to both methods having differing impacts on the
      underlying disease dynamics. Additionally, depending on the impact of human
      movement on the disease dynamics, the optimal way to combat the spread of dengue 
      is to focus prevention efforts on large population centres. Using mathematical
      frameworks, such as optimal control, are essential in developing predictive
      management and mitigation strategies for dengue disease control.

TI  - Acute kidney injury in dengue among hospitalized children: A prospective view.
PG  - 407-414
LID - 10.4103/1319-2442.284015 [doi]
AB  - Dengue viral infection (DVI) has emerged as one of the most common arthropod
      borne diseases and is more prevalent in the tropical countries. It has varied
      clinical spectrum ranging from undifferentiated fever to severe hemorrhagic fever
      and shock with multi-organ dysfunction. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is lesser known
      complication in DVI. Although studies report varying reports of AKI in DVI among 
      children, exact incidence is not known as most of the studies are retrospective. 
      Hospital-based observational study in 105 children with DVI requiring admission
      was studied for the occurrence of AKI along with clinical course and outcome. AKI
      Network (AKIN) criteria were used to define AKI. The IBM SPSS Statistics software
      version 21.0 was used for the statistical analysis. Of 105 children with dengue, 
      six (5.71%) cases developed AKI. All six cases had urine output <0.5 mL/kg/h for 
      >/=12 h. Out of six cases with AKI, four had raised serum creatinine (SCr) >/=0.3
      mg/dL at admission. One child had normal SCr level at admission which got
      deranged over the next 12 h, one child had oliguria ( <0.5 mL/kg/h) for about 24 
      h though the renal function was not deranged. Out of six children with AKI, three
      (50%) in Stage III and three had AKI Stage II as per the AKIN criteria. Children 
      with AKI (Group A) differed significantly from those without AKI (Group B) in
      having blood pressure <3(rd) centile (P = 0.0023), tachycardia P = 0.008),
      hyponatremia and hypokalemia (P <0.001 and P = 0.029, respectively) and poor
      outcome 6% mortality in Group B compared to 66.67% in Group A) with P = 0.001.
      AKI is not a common complication of DVI but if develops it may lead to
      significant morbidity and mortality among pediatric age group.

TI  - A Mixed-Methods Approach to Understanding Knowledge of Mosquito-Borne Infections 
      and Barriers for Protection in Hanoi, Vietnam.
LID - E66 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/tropicalmed5020066 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a growing problem in Hanoi, with cyclical epidemics of increasing
      frequency and magnitude. In June 2019, we conducted a cross-sectional survey
      using mixed methods to investigate how inhabitants of Hanoi perceive and respond 
      to the risk of mosquito-borne diseases (MBD). A total of 117 participants
      recruited using a stratified random sampling method were interviewed in three
      districts of Hanoi. Knowledge and practices (KP) regarding MBDs were assessed
      using a pre-tested questionnaire. Inferential statistics were used to identify
      factors associated with KP scores and describe the relationship between
      variables. Additionally, a "risk-mapping" exercise was conducted in a subsample
      through semi-structured interviews and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively 
      using the System Effects platform. Factors significantly associated with
      knowledge scores were education and family history of MBDs. While knowledge and
      practice scores were found to be positively correlated in the statistical
      analysis, this was not corroborated by our observations on the field. The results
      also revealed gaps in knowledge about MBDs and vectors and highlighted a general 
      feeling of powerlessness which prevented the adoption of protective behaviors.
      Therefore, educational interventions which provide concrete tools to empower
      communities should have a positive impact on improving vector control.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging, mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for
      recent epidemics across the Americas, and it is closely related to dengue virus
      (DENV). Here, we study samples from 46 DENV-naive and 43 DENV-immune patients
      with RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infection at early-acute, late-acute, and convalescent
      time points from our pediatric cohort study in Nicaragua. We analyze the samples 
      via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), CyTOF, and multiplex cytokine/chemokine Luminex to 
      generate a comprehensive, innate immune profile during ZIKV infection.
      Immunophenotyping and analysis of cytokines/chemokines reveal that CD14(+)
      monocytes play a key role during ZIKV infection. Further, we identify CD169
      (Siglec-1) on CD14(+) monocytes as a potential biomarker of acute ZIKV infection.
      Strikingly distinct transcriptomic and immunophenotypic signatures are observed
      at all three time points. Interestingly, pre-existing dengue immunity has minimal
      impact on the innate immune response to Zika. Finally, this comprehensive immune 
      profiling and network analysis of ZIKV infection in children serves as a valuable
      resource.

AB  - Objective: To analyze data gathered from the laboratory records related to
      imported Dengue cases in Henan province in 2018. Methods: Suspected Dengue cases 
      were found out through the Dengue fever surveillance network from the National
      infectious Disease reporting management information system. Serum samples of
      suspected Dengue cases were collected while case study and tested for Dengue NS1 
      antigen, IgM, IgG antibodies and Dengue RNA in Henan province in 2018. According 
      to the standardized Dengue diagnosis criteria, confirmed cases were identified
      under the results of testing. Dengue RNA was checked by Real-time PCR genotyping 
      and amplification of E gene in the samples being tested, before the PCR products 
      were sequenced and analyses of homological and phylogenetic were performed.
      Results: In 2018, a total of 29 cases of Dengue fever was reported in Henan
      province, with all of which were imported cases, mainly from Southeast Asian
      countries and Africa. Majority of the cases were young and middle-aged farmers
      under 45 years old, and the number of males was significantly higher than that of
      females. The imported cases were dispersed in time and space. Among the 29 Dengue
      reported cases, 22 cases were with NS1 antigen and/or IgM positive through
      testing, while 6 cases were positive by detection of the Dengue virus RNA. These 
      6 samples with Dengue RNA were genotyped successfully, including 3 cases of
      Dengue virus type 1 and 3 cases of type 2. One of the Maldives import Dengue
      virus type 2 samples was sequenced. Result showed that the sequence belonged to
      the Asian genotype, which was most consistently similar to the Cambodia's Dengue 
      virus type 2 JF730046, identified in 2008. Conclusions: The incidence of imported

TI  - Target Identification Using Homopharma and Network-Based Methods for Predicting
      Compounds Against Dengue Virus-Infected Cells.
LID - E1883 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules25081883 [doi]
AB  - Drug target prediction is an important method for drug discovery and design, can 
      disclose the potential inhibitory effect of active compounds, and is particularly
      relevant to many diseases that have the potential to kill, such as dengue, but
      lack any healing agent. An antiviral drug is urgently required for dengue
      treatment. Some potential antiviral agents are still in the process of drug
      discovery, but the development of more effective active molecules is in critical 
      demand. Herein, we aimed to provide an efficient technique for target prediction 
      using homopharma and network-based methods, which is reliable and expeditious to 
      hunt for the possible human targets of three phenolic lipids (anarcardic acid,
      cardol, and cardanol) related to dengue viral (DENV) infection as a case study.
      Using several databases, the similarity search and network-based analyses were
      applied on the three phenolic lipids resulting in the identification of seven
      possible targets as follows. Based on protein annotation, three phenolic lipids
      may interrupt or disturb the human proteins, namely KAT5, GAPDH, ACTB, and
      HSP90AA1, whose biological functions have been previously reported to be involved
      with viruses in the family Flaviviridae. In addition, these phenolic lipids might
      inhibit the mechanism of the viral proteins: NS3, NS5, and E proteins. The DENV
      and human proteins obtained from this study could be potential targets for
      further molecular optimization on compounds with a phenolic lipid core structure 
      in anti-dengue drug discovery. As such, this pipeline could be a valuable tool to
      identify possible targets of active compounds.

AB  - During infectious disease outbreaks, the centers for disease control need to
      monitor particular areas. Considerable effort has been invested in the
      development of portable, user-friendly, and cost-effective systems for
      point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, which could also create an Internet of Things
      (IoT) for healthcare via a global network. However, at present IoT based on a
      functional POC instrument is not available. Here we show a fast, user-friendly,
      and affordable IoT system based on a miniaturized polymerase chain reaction
      device. We demonstrated the system's capability by amplification of complementary
      deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) of the dengue fever virus. The resulting data were
      then automatically uploaded via a Bluetooth interface to an Android-based
      smartphone and then wirelessly sent to a global network, instantly making the
      test results available anywhere in the world. The IoT system presented here could
      become an essential tool for healthcare centers to tackle infectious disease
      outbreaks identified either by DNA or ribonucleic acid.

LID - 10.3201/eid2604.190443 [doi]
AB  - To determine the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of patients in Spain 
      with imported arbovirus infections, we analyzed 22,655 records from a
      collaborative network for January 2009-December 2018. Among 861 arbovirus
      infections, 845 were monoinfections (456 [53%] dengue, 280 [32.5%] chikungunya,
      109 [12.7%] Zika) and 16 (1.8%) were co-infections. Most patients were travelers 
      (56.3%) or immigrants returning to Spain after visiting friends or relatives
      (31.3%). Median patient age was 37 years; most (62.3%) were women and some
      (28.6%) had received pretravel advice. Only 12 patients were immunosuppressed.
      Six cases (all dengue monoinfections, none in immunosuppressed patients) were
      severe. Since 2014, nondengue arbovirus infections increased; until 2016,
      chikungunya and Zika were most common. Imported arbovirus infections (mostly
      dengue) were frequently diagnosed, although increased chikungunya and Zika virus 
      infections coincided with their introduction and spread in the Americas. A large 
      proportion of cases occurred in women of childbearing age, some despite receipt
      of pretravel advice.

TI  - The time series seasonal patterns of dengue fever and associated weather
      variables in Bangkok (2003-2017).

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Thailand, dengue fever is one of the most well-known public health
      problems. The objective of this study was to examine the epidemiology of dengue
      and determine the seasonal pattern of dengue and its associate to climate factors
      in Bangkok, Thailand, from 2003 to 2017. METHODS: The dengue cases in Bangkok
      were collected monthly during the study period. The time-series data were
      extracted into the trend, seasonal, and random components using the seasonal
      decomposition procedure based on loess. The Spearman correlation analysis and
      artificial neuron network (ANN) were used to determine the association between
      climate variables (humidity, temperature, and rainfall) and dengue cases in
      Bangkok. RESULTS: The seasonal-decomposition procedure showed that the seasonal
      component was weaker than the trend component for dengue cases during the study
      period. The Spearman correlation analysis showed that rainfall and humidity
      played a role in dengue transmission with correlation efficiency equal to 0.396
      and 0.388, respectively. ANN showed that precipitation was the most crucial
      factor. The time series multivariate Poisson regression model revealed that
      increasing 1% of rainfall corresponded to an increase of 3.3% in the dengue cases
      in Bangkok. There were three models employed to forecast the dengue case,
      multivariate Poisson regression, ANN, and ARIMA. Each model displayed different
      accuracy, and multivariate Poisson regression was the most accurate approach in
      this study. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates the significance of weather in
      dengue transmission in Bangkok and compares the accuracy of the different
      mathematical approaches to predict the dengue case. A single model may
      insufficient to forecast precisely a dengue outbreak, and climate factor may not 
      only indicator of dengue transmissibility.

TI  - Dengue importation into Europe: A network connectivity-based approach.
PG  - e0230274
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0230274 [doi]
AB  - The spread of dengue through global human mobility is a major public health
      concern. A key challenge is understanding the transmission pathways and mediating
      factors that characterized the patterns of dengue importation into non-endemic
      areas. Utilizing a network connectivity-based approach, we analyze the
      importation patterns of dengue fever into European countries. Seven connectivity 
      indices were developed to characterize the role of the air passenger traffic,
      seasonality, incidence rate, geographical proximity, epidemic vulnerability, and 
      wealth of a source country, in facilitating the transport and importation of
      dengue fever. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to examine the
      relationship between dengue importation and the connectivity indices while
      accounting for the air transport network structure. We also incorporated network 
      autocorrelation within a GLMM framework to investigate the propensity of a
      European country to receive an imported case, by virtue of its position within
      the air transport network. The connectivity indices and dynamical processes of
      the air transport network were strong predictors of dengue importation in Europe.
      With more than 70% of the variation in dengue importation patterns explained. We 
      found that transportation potential was higher for source countries with seasonal
      dengue activity, high passenger traffic, high incidence rates, high epidemic
      vulnerability, and in geographical proximity to a destination country in Europe. 
      We also found that position of a European country within the air transport
      network was a strong predictor of the country's propensity to receive an imported
      case. Our findings provide evidence that the importation patterns of dengue into 
      Europe can be largely explained by appropriately characterizing the
      heterogeneities of the source, and topology of the air transport network. This
      contributes to the foundational framework for building integrated predictive
      models for bio-surveillance of dengue importation.

TI  - Single cell immune profiling of dengue virus patients reveals intact immune
      responses to Zika virus with enrichment of innate immune signatures.
PG  - e0008112

AB  - The genus Flavivirus contains many mosquito-borne human pathogens of global
      epidemiological importance such as dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Zika virus,
      which has recently emerged at epidemic levels. Infections with these viruses
      result in divergent clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. Myriad 
      factors influence infection severity including exposure, immune status and
      pathogen/host genetics. Furthermore, pre-existing infection may skew immune
      pathways or divert immune resources. We profiled immune cells from dengue
      virus-infected individuals by multiparameter mass cytometry (CyTOF) to define
      functional status. Elevations in IFNbeta were noted in acute patients across the 
      majority of cell types and were statistically elevated in 31 of 36 cell subsets. 
      We quantified response to in vitro (re)infection with dengue or Zika viruses and 
      detected a striking pattern of upregulation of responses to Zika infection by
      innate cell types which was not noted in response to dengue virus. Significance
      was discovered by statistical analysis as well as a neural network-based
      clustering approach which identified unusual cell subsets overlooked by
      conventional manual gating. Of public health importance, patient cells showed
      significant enrichment of innate cell responses to Zika virus indicating an
      intact and robust anti-Zika response despite the concurrent dengue infection.

AB  - Background & objectives: Dengue virus (DENV) transmission is known to be
      influenced by the environmental conditions. During 2017, the Viral Research and
      Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) tested 78,744 suspected dengue fever (DF)
      patients, of whom, 21,260 were laboratory confirmed. The objectives of the study 
      were to evaluate the hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity existed for DF
      patients and to identify significant determinants of DENV transmission in various
      districts across the Indian States during 2017. Methods: Laboratory confirmed DF 
      cases were analysed from 402 districts spread across the Indian States. The
      determinants for DF transmission included in the model were population density,
      proportion of population living in rural areas, proportion o f forest cover area 
      to the total geographical area, proportion of persons not able to read and write 
      and who were aged greater than seven years; the climatic variables considered
      were minimum, maximum and average temperature, precipitation and cumulative
      rainfall. The spatial heterogeneity was assessed using spatial regression
      analysis. Results: DF cases showed strong spatial dependency, with Moran's I=4.44
      (P <0.001). The robust measure for spatial lag (6.55; P=0.01) was found to be the
      best model fit for the data set. Minimum temperature and cumulative rainfall were
      significant predictors. Interpretation & conclusions: A significant increase in
      the number of dengue cases has occurred when the minimum temperature was
      23.0-25.8 degrees C and the cumulative rainfall 118.14-611.64 mm across the
      Indian districts. Further in-depth investigations incorporating more number of
      demographic, ecological and socio-economic factors would be needed for robust
      conclusions.

AB  - The population genetics study is crucial as it helps in understanding the
      epidemiological aspects of dengue and help improving a vector control measures.
      This research aims to investigate the population genetics structure of two common
      species of Aedes mosquitoes in Penang; Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus using
      Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) marker. Molecular
      investigations were derived from 440 bp and 418 bp mtDNA COI on 125 and 334
      larvae of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus respectively, from 32 locations in
      Penang. All samples were employed in the BLASTn for species identification. The
      haplotype diversity, nucleotide diversity, neutrality test and mismatch
      distribution analysis were conducted in DnaSP version 5.10.1. AMOVA analysis was 
      conducted in ARLEQUIN version 3.5 and the phylogenetic reconstructions based on
      maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbor-joining (NJ) methods were implemented in
      MEGA X. The relationships among haplotypes were further tested by creating a
      minimum spanning tree using Network version 4.6.1. All samples were genetically
      identified and clustered into six distinct species. Among the species, Ae.
      albopictus was the most abundant (67.2%), followed by Ae. aegypti (25.2%) and the
      rest were counted for Culex sp. and Toxorhynchites sp. Both Ae. aegypti and Ae.
      albopictus show low nucleotide diversity (pi) and high haplotype diversity (h),
      while the neutrality test shows a negative value in most of the population for
      both species. There are a total of 39 and 64 haplotypes recorded for Ae. aegypti 
      and Ae. albopictus respectively. AMOVA analysis revealed that most of the
      variation occurred within population for both species. Mismatch distribution
      analysis showed bimodal characteristic of population differentiation for Ae.
      aegypti but Ae. albopictus showed unimodal characteristics of population
      differentiation. Genetic distance based on Tamura-Nei parameter showed low
      genetic divergent within population and high genetic divergent among population
      for both species. The maximum likelihood tree showed no obvious pattern of
      population genetic structure for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from Penang 
      and a moderate to high bootstrap values has supported this conclusion. The
      minimum spanning network for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus showed five and three
      dominant haplotypes respectively, which indicates a mixture of haplotypes from
      the regions analysed. This study revealed that there is no population genetic
      structure exhibited by both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in Penang. Mutation
      has occurred rapidly in both species and this will be challenging in controlling 
      the populations. However, further analysis needed to confirm this statement.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is considered one of the six most important infectious diseases in 
      the world. In spite of its importance, the leishmaniasis is one of the world's
      most neglected tropical diseases. Bichromomyia flaviscutellata sensu lato is a
      complex composed of at least three species: B. flaviscutellata sensu stricto, B. 
      reducta and B. olmeca. The latter is composed of three subspecies: B. olmeca
      olmeca, B. olmeca bicolor and B. olmeca nociva, which are distributed from
      Central America to South America. Of these, B. flaviscutellata s.s. is recognized
      as the main vector of Leishmania amazonensis in Brazil. The present study aimed
      to identify molecularly the species and subspecies of the B. flaviscutellata
      complex using the 5' region of the COI gene (Barcode region). A total of 44
      specimens, comprising 22 B. flaviscutellata s.s. and 22 B. olmeca nociva, were
      analyzed from six localities in the Brazilian Amazon: five in the State of
      Amazonas (Autazes, Manaus, Pitinga, Novo Airao, and Rio Preto da Eva), and one in
      the State of Para (Serra do Cachorro). Three sequences from B. olmeca olmeca and 
      one of B. olmeca bicolor from GenBank were also added to the dataset, totaling 48
      sequences with a length of 549 base pairs (bp). The total dataset generated 28
      haplotypes and four disconnected networks. Phylogenetic analyses using three
      algorithms (Neighbor-Joining [NJ], Maximum Likelihood [ML] and Bayesian Inference
      [BI]) generated similar topologies and most clades were from moderately to highly
      supported. The phylogenetic relationship, together with genetic distance values
      (1%) and haplotypes networks, confirm the position of B. olmeca bicolor as a
      subspecies of B. olmeca olmeca. However, B. olmeca nociva was closer
      phylogenetically to B. flaviscutellata s.s. than to B. olmeca olmeca and B.
      olmeca bicolor. Additionally, the haplotype network separated B. olmeca nociva
      from B. olmeca olmeca and B. olmeca bicolor. These findings, combined with
      previous morphological data, suggest that the B. olmeca nociva should be elevated
      to full-species status. The findings of this study also found that B.
      flaviscutellata s.s. populations may be in process of forming lineages.

TI  - A network analysis framework to improve the delivery of mosquito abatement
      services in Machala, Ecuador.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.1186/s12942-020-0196-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vector-borne disease places a high health and economic burden in the 
      American tropics. Comprehensive vector control programs remain the primary method
      of containing local outbreaks. With limited resources, many vector control
      operations struggle to serve all affected communities within their districts. In 
      the coastal city of Machala, Ecuador, vector control services, such as
      application of larvicides and truck-mounted fogging, are delivered through two
      deployment facilities managed by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Health. Public health
      professionals in Machala face several logistical issues when delivering mosquito 
      abatement services, namely applying limited resources in ways that will most
      effectively suppress vectors of malaria, dengue, and encephalitis viruses.
      METHODS: Using a transportation network analysis framework, we built models of
      service areas and optimized delivery routes based on distance costs associated
      with accessing neighborhoods throughout the city. Optimized routes were used to
      estimate the relative cost of accessing neighborhoods for mosquito control
      services in Machala, creating a visual tool to guide decision makers and maximize
      mosquito control program efficiency. Location-allocation analyses were performed 
      to evaluate efficiency gains of moving service deployment to other available
      locations with respect to distance to service hub, neighborhood population,
      dengue incidence, and housing condition. RESULTS: Using this framework, we
      identified different locations for targeting mosquito control efforts, dependent 
      upon management goals and specified risk factors of interest, including human
      population, housing condition, and reported dengue incidence. Our models indicate
      that neighborhoods on the periphery of Machala with the poorest housing
      conditions are the most costly to access. Optimal locations of facilities for
      deployment of control services change depending on pre-determined management
      priorities, increasing the population served via inexpensive routes up to 34.9%, 
      and reducing overall cost of accessing neighborhoods up to 12.7%. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our transportation network models indicate that current locations of mosquito
      control facilities in Machala are not ideal for minimizing driving distances or
      maximizing populations served. Services may be optimized by moving vector control
      operations to other existing public health facilities in Machala. This work
      represents a first step in creating a spatial tool for planning and critically
      evaluating the systematic delivery of mosquito control services in Machala and
      elsewhere.

TI  - Host factor prioritization for pan-viral genetic perturbation screens using
      random intercept models and network propagation.
PG  - e1007587
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007587 [doi]
AB  - Genetic perturbation screens using RNA interference (RNAi) have been conducted
      successfully to identify host factors that are essential for the life cycle of
      bacteria or viruses. So far, most published studies identified host factors
      primarily for single pathogens. Furthermore, often only a small subset of genes, 
      e.g., genes encoding kinases, have been targeted. Identification of host factors 
      on a pan-pathogen level, i.e., genes that are crucial for the replication of a
      diverse group of pathogens has received relatively little attention, despite the 
      fact that such common host factors would be highly relevant, for instance, for
      devising broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic drugs. Here, we present a novel two-stage
      procedure for the identification of host factors involved in the replication of
      different viruses using a combination of random effects models and Markov random 
      walks on a functional interaction network. We first infer candidate genes by
      jointly analyzing multiple perturbations screens while at the same time adjusting
      for high variance inherent in these screens. Subsequently the inferred estimates 
      are spread across a network of functional interactions thereby allowing for the
      analysis of missing genes in the biological studies, smoothing the effect sizes
      of previously found host factors, and considering a priori pathway information
      defined over edges of the network. We applied the procedure to RNAi screening
      data of four different positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, Hepatitis C
      virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus and Severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus, and detected novel host factors, including UBC, PLCG1, and DYRK1B,
      which are predicted to significantly impact the replication cycles of these
      viruses. We validated the detected host factors experimentally using
      pharmacological inhibition and an additional siRNA screen and found that some of 
      the predicted host factors indeed influence the replication of these pathogens.

TI  - Geographical Genetic Variation and Sources of Korean Aedes albopictus (Diptera:
      Culicidae) Populations.
PG  - 1057-1068
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjz254 [doi]
AB  - Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894) is a mosquito vector raising global health
      concerns owing to its transmission of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. This
      vector accounts for a large proportion of the Korean mosquito community; however,
      autochthonous clinical cases resulting from this species remain unreported in
      South Korea. This study aimed to examine the geographical genetic variations and 
      sources of Ae. albopictus populations in South Korea exclusively on the basis of 
      COI gene analysis from 292 samples collected from 37 localities in 2016-2018 and 
      290 reference sequences from GenBank. Thirty-eight haplotypes were identified
      among the 292 Ae. albopictus samples, with H1 (n = 190, 65.1%), H29 (n = 24,
      8.22%), and H32 (n = 24, 8.22%) being the most common and widely distributed
      haplotypes in the mainland, southern coastal region, and Jeju Island,
      respectively. In general, high haplotype (>/=0.5; 44.7%) and low nucleotide
      (</=0.00148 max.) diversity were observed in these populations. Based on eight
      regional groups, results of neutral tests and a mismatch analysis supported
      demographic expansions after bottlenecks. Furthermore, analysis of molecular
      variance, FST, and K2P distance showed that Gyeongsangnam-do, Jeju Island, and
      mainland groups were genetically differentiated. Haplotype network and
      phylogenetic analyses revealed that the sources of the main haplotypes are
      related to strains from other countries. The current findings need to be
      validated with additional sampling from heterogeneous habitats and different
      genetic markers. However, our results suggest that haplotype changes should be
      closely monitored for efficient vector surveillance and control.

TI  - Online Advanced Analytical Service: Profiles for Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever
      Transmission in Southern Thailand.
PG  - 1979-1987
AB  - Background: Southern Thailand has the highest Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF)
      incidence and fatality rate in Thailand. Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
      technology and spatial analysis techniques are powerful tools to describe
      epidemiological patterns. The aim of this study was to develop an Online Advanced
      Analytical Service: Profiles for Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Transmission (OSD) in
      Southern Thailand. Methods: The system was developed using JavaServer Pages (JSP)
      and Database Management System (DBMS) with Structured Query Language (SQL)
      technology as the web database tool for data entry and data access, web
      Mathematica technology for data analysis and Google Maps API technology for
      online data display as the map service implementing GIS technology. Results: The 
      OSD system has been available online at URL http://www.s-cm.co/dengue . Users
      performed data entry using the web-service with login by social network (i.e.
      Facebook) account, used data analysis tools with online real-time statistical
      analysis and data display with transparent color circles overlaid on Google Maps.
      Conclusion: The OSD system display represents the distribution of DHF cases with 
      spatial information. This system enables health planners to provide interventions
      for DHF focusing on prevention, control, and strategic planning.

TI  - Complementarity of empirical and process-based approaches to modelling mosquito
      population dynamics with Aedes albopictus as an example-Application to the
      development of an operational mapping tool of vector populations.
PG  - e0227407
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0227407 [doi]
AB  - Mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of major pathogens worldwide.
      Modelling their population dynamics and mapping their distribution can contribute
      effectively to disease surveillance and control systems. Two main approaches are 
      classically used to understand and predict mosquito abundance in space and time, 
      namely empirical (or statistical) and process-based models. In this work, we used
      both approaches to model the population dynamics in Reunion Island of the 'Tiger 
      mosquito', Aedes albopictus, a vector of dengue and chikungunya viruses, using
      rainfall and temperature data. We aimed to i) evaluate and compare the two types 
      of models, and ii) develop an operational tool that could be used by public
      health authorities and vector control services. Our results showed that Ae.
      albopictus dynamics in Reunion Island are driven by both rainfall and temperature
      with a non-linear relationship. The predictions of the two approaches were
      consistent with the observed abundances of Ae. albopictus aquatic stages. An
      operational tool with a user-friendly interface was developed, allowing the
      creation of maps of Ae. albopictus densities over the whole territory using
      meteorological data collected from a network of weather stations. It is now
      routinely used by the services in charge of vector control in Reunion Island.

TI  - Does Bangkok have a central role in the dengue dynamics of Thailand?
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/s13071-020-3892-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bangkok plays a central role in the commerce of Thailand. This study 
      aimed to characterize the district-level spatial-temporal patterns of dengue in
      Thailand and explore if a dengue peak in Bangkok led the peaks of dengue in other
      Thai provinces. METHODS: Monthly dengue data at district level in Thailand from
      January 2004 to December 2017 were obtained and used to assess the spatial and
      seasonal patterns of dengue in Thailand. As our seasonal decomposition and
      cross-correlation analyses showed that dengue in Bangkok peaked in November,
      which was a few months after the dengue peak in most other provinces, we used a
      time-series generalized linear model to explore if there was another province in 
      which the dengue case number was most predictive of dengue case numbers in other 
      Thai provinces. RESULTS: The highest district-level annual dengue incidence rates
      (per 10,000) in the three time periods (i.e. 2004-2008, 2009-2013 and 2014-2017) 
      were 58.08 (Samphanthawong), 85.93 (Mueang Krabi), and 66.60 (Mae Sariang),
      respectively. Dengue incidence rates in the western part of Northern Thailand,
      southern part of Central Thailand, southern part of Eastern Thailand, and
      Southern Thailand were higher than in other regions. Dengue in most districts of 
      Thailand peaked in June, July or August, but dengue peaks in all districts of
      Bangkok occurred in November. The number of dengue cases in Nakhon Ratchasima was
      most predictive of the number of dengue cases in other provinces in Thailand by a
      one-month lag. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the dengue peak in Bangkok
      did not lead the peaks of dengue in other Thai provinces. Future research
      exploring how changes in socio-ecological factors (e.g. road network and climate 
      factors) in Nakhon Ratchasima have affected the transmission of dengue in
      Thailand might shed some new light on the prevention and control of dengue.

TI  - Statistical characteristics of amino acid covariance as possible descriptors of
      viral genomic complexity.
PG  - 18410
LID - 10.1038/s41598-019-54720-y [doi]
AB  - At the sequence level it is hard to describe the complexity of viruses which
      allows them to challenge host immune system, some for a few weeks and others up
      to a complete compromise. Paradoxically, viral genomes are both complex and
      simple. Complex because amino acid mutation rates are very high, and yet viruses 
      remain functional. Simple because they have barely around 10 types of proteins,
      so viral protein-protein interaction networks are not insightful. In this work we
      use fine-grained amino acid level information and their evolutionary
      characteristics obtained from large-scale genomic data to develop a statistical
      panel, towards the goal of developing quantitative descriptors for the biological
      complexity of viruses. Networks were constructed from pairwise covariation of
      amino acids and were statistically analyzed. Three differentiating factors arise:
      predominantly intra- vs inter-protein covariance relations, the nature of the
      node degree distribution and network density. Interestingly, the covariance
      relations were primarily intra-protein in avian influenza and inter-protein in
      HIV. The degree distributions showed two universality classes: a power-law with
      exponent -1 in HIV and avian-influenza, random behavior in human flu and dengue. 
      The calculated covariance network density correlates well with the mortality
      strengths of viruses on the viral-Richter scale. These observations suggest the
      potential utility of the statistical metrics for describing the covariance
      patterns in viruses. Our host-virus interaction analysis point to the possibility
      that host proteins which can interact with multiple viral proteins may be
      responsible for shaping the inter-protein covariance relations. With the
      available data, it appears that network density might be a surrogate for the
      virus Richter scale, however the hypothesis needs a re-examination when large
      scale complete genome data for more viruses becomes available.

TI  - A global model for predicting the arrival of imported dengue infections.
PG  - e0225193
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0225193 [doi]
AB  - With approximately half of the world's population at risk of contracting dengue, 
      this mosquito-borne disease is of global concern. International travellers
      significantly contribute to dengue's rapid and large-scale spread by importing
      the disease from endemic into non-endemic countries. To prevent future outbreaks 
      and dengue from establishing in non-endemic countries, knowledge about the
      arrival time and location of infected travellers is crucial. We propose a network
      model that predicts the monthly number of dengue-infected air passengers arriving
      at any given airport. We consider international air travel volumes to construct
      weighted networks, representing passenger flows between airports. We further
      calculate the probability of passengers, who travel through the international air
      transport network, being infected with dengue. The probability of being infected 
      depends on the destination, duration and timing of travel. Our findings shed
      light onto dengue importation routes and reveal country-specific reporting rates 
      that have been until now largely unknown. This paper provides important new
      knowledge about the spreading dynamics of dengue that is highly beneficial for
      public health authorities to strategically allocate the often limited resources
      to more efficiently prevent the spread of dengue.

TI  - An ensemble model for forecasting infectious diseases in India.
PG  - 822-832
AB  - Time series modelling and forecasting plays an important role in various domains.
      The objective of this paper is to construct a simple average ensemble method to
      forecast the number of cases for infectious diseases like dengue and typhoid and 
      compare it by applying models for forecasting. In this paper we have also
      evaluated the correlation between the number of typhoid and dengue cases with the
      ecological variables. The monthly data of dengue and typhoid cases from 2014 to
      2017 were taken from integrated diseases surveillance programme, Government of
      India. This data was analysed by three models namely support vector regression,
      neural network and linear regression. The proposed simple average ensemble model 
      was constructed by ensemble of three applied regression models i.e. SVR, NN and
      LR. We combine the regression models based upon the error metrics such as Mean
      Square Error, Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error. It was found that
      proposed ensemble method performed better in terms of forecast measures. The
      finding demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms as compared to already
      available applied models on the basis of forecast accuracy.

TI  - Flavivirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Interacts with Genome UTRs and Viral
      Proteins to Facilitate Flavivirus RNA Replication.
LID - E929 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v11100929 [doi]
AB  - Flaviviruses, most of which are emerging and re-emerging human pathogens and
      significant public health concerns worldwide, are positive-sense RNA viruses.
      Flavivirus replication occurs on the ER and is regulated by many mechanisms and
      factors. NS5, which consists of a C-terminal RdRp domain and an N-terminal
      methyltransferase domain, plays a pivotal role in genome replication and capping.
      The C-terminal RdRp domain acts as the polymerase for RNA synthesis and
      cooperates with diverse viral proteins to facilitate productive RNA proliferation
      within the replication complex. Here, we provide an overview of the current
      knowledge of the functions and characteristics of the RdRp, including the
      subcellular localization of NS5, as well as the network of interactions formed
      between the RdRp and genome UTRs, NS3, and the methyltransferase domain. We posit
      that a detailed understanding of RdRp functions may provide a target for
      antiviral drug discovery and therapeutics.

TI  - ZikaPLAN: addressing the knowledge gaps and working towards a research
      preparedness network in the Americas.
PG  - 1666566
LID - 10.1080/16549716.2019.1666566 [doi]
AB  - Zika Preparedness Latin American Network (ZikaPLAN) is a research consortium
      funded by the European Commission to address the research gaps in combating Zika 
      and to establish a sustainable network with research capacity building in the
      Americas. Here we present a report on ZikaPLAN`s mid-term achievements since its 
      initiation in October 2016 to June 2019, illustrating the research objectives of 
      the 15 work packages ranging from virology, diagnostics, entomology and vector
      control, modelling to clinical cohort studies in pregnant women and neonates, as 
      well as studies on the neurological complications of Zika infections in
      adolescents and adults. For example, the Neuroviruses Emerging in the Americas
      Study (NEAS) has set up more than 10 clinical sites in Colombia. Through the
      Butantan Phase 3 dengue vaccine trial, we have access to samples of 17,000
      subjects in 14 different geographic locations in Brazil. To address the lack of
      access to clinical samples for diagnostic evaluation, ZikaPLAN set up a network
      of quality sites with access to well-characterized clinical specimens and
      capacity for independent evaluations. The International Committee for Congenital 
      Anomaly Surveillance Tools was formed with global representation from regional
      networks conducting birth defects surveillance. We have collated a comprehensive 
      inventory of resources and tools for birth defects surveillance, and developed an
      App for low resource regions facilitating the coding and description of all major
      externally visible congenital anomalies including congenital Zika syndrome.
      Research Capacity Network (REDe) is a shared and open resource centre where
      researchers and health workers can access tools, resources and support, enabling 
      better and more research in the region. Addressing the gap in research capacity
      in LMICs is pivotal in ensuring broad-based systems to be prepared for the next
      outbreak. Our shared and open research space through REDe will be used to
      maximize the transfer of research into practice by summarizing the research
      output and by hosting the tools, resources, guidance and recommendations
      generated by these studies. Leveraging on the research from this consortium, we
      are working towards a research preparedness network.

AB  - Flaviviruses, including dengue virus and Zika virus, extensively remodel the
      cellular endomembrane network to generate replication organelles that promote
      viral genome replication and virus production. However, it remains unclear how
      these membranes and associated cellular proteins act during the virus cycle.
      Here, we show that atlastins (ATLs), a subset of ER resident proteins involved in
      neurodegenerative diseases, have dichotomous effects on flaviviruses-with ATL2
      depletion leading to replication organelle defects, and ATL3 depletion to changes
      in virus production pathways. We characterized non-conserved functional domains
      in ATL paralogues and show that the ATL interactome is profoundly reprogrammed
      following dengue virus infection. Screen analysis confirmed non-redundant ATL
      functions and identified a specific role for ATL3, and its interactor ARF4, in
      vesicle trafficking and virion maturation. Our data identify ATLs as central hubs
      targeted by flaviviruses to establish their replication organelle and to achieve 
      efficient virion maturation and secretion.

TI  - The addition of mobile SMS effectively improves dengue prevention practices in
      community: an implementation study in Nepal.
PG  - 699
LID - 10.1186/s12913-019-4541-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is an emerging vector disease with frequent outbreaks in Nepal
      that pose a major threat to public health. Dengue control activities are mostly
      outbreak driven, and still lack systematic interventions while most people have
      poor health-related knowledge and practices. Mobile Short Message Service (SMS)
      represents a low-cost health promotion intervention that can enhance the dengue
      prevention knowledge and practices of the affected communities. This study aimed 
      to explore the acceptability, appropriateness, and effectiveness of mobile SMS
      intervention in improving dengue control practices. METHODS: This study was an
      implementation research that used mixed-methods design with intervention. A total
      of 300 households were divided into three groups, i.e. one control group, one
      dengue prevention leaflet (DPL) only intervention group and one DPL with mobile
      SMS intervention group (DPL + SMS). We used a structured questionnaire to collect
      information regarding participants' knowledge and practice of dengue prevention. 
      We conducted in-depth interviews with key informants to measure acceptability and
      appropriateness of intervention. Mean difference with standard deviation (SD),
      one-way ANOVA, paired t-test and regression analyses were used to assess the
      effectiveness of the interventions. Thematic analysis was used to assess the
      acceptability, and appropriateness as well as barriers and enablers of the
      intervention. RESULTS: The DPL + SMS intervention produced significantly higher
      mean knowledge difference (32.7 +/- 13.7 SD vs. 13.3 +/- 8.8 SD) and mean
      practice difference (27.9 +/- 11.4 SD vs 4.9 +/- 5.4 SD) compared to the DPL only
      group (p = 0.000). Multivariate analysis showed that the DPL + SMS intervention
      was effective to increase knowledge by 28.6 points and practice by 28.1 points
      compared to the control group. The intervention was perceived as acceptable and
      appropriate by the study participants and key stakeholders. Perceived barriers
      included reaching private network users and poor network in geographically remote
      areas, while enabling factors included mobile phone penetration, low cost, and
      shared responsibility. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile SMS is an effective, acceptable and
      appropriate health intervention to improve dengue prevention practices in
      communities. This intervention can be adopted as a promising tool for health
      education against dengue and other diseases.

TI  - Population genetics of Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) in its native range 
      in Lao People's Democratic Republic.
PG  - 477
LID - 10.1186/s13071-019-3740-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) is an 
      important worldwide invasive species and can be a locally important vector of
      chikungunya, dengue and, potentially, Zika. This species is native to Southeast
      Asia where populations thrive in both temperate and tropical climates. A better
      understanding of the population structure of Ae. albopictus in Lao PDR is very
      important in order to support the implementation of strategies for diseases
      prevention and vector control. In the present study, we investigated the genetic 
      variability of Ae. albopictus across a north-south transect in Lao PDR. METHODS: 
      We used variability in a 1337-bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c
      oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1), to assess the population structure of Ae.
      albopictus in Lao PDR. For context, we also examined variability at the same
      genetic locus in samples of Ae. albopictus from Thailand, China, Taiwan, Japan,
      Singapore, Italy and the USA. RESULTS: We observed very high levels of genetic
      polymorphism with 46 novel haplotypes in Ae. albopictus from 9 localities in Lao 
      PDR and Thailand populations. Significant differences were observed between the
      Luangnamtha population and other locations in Lao PDR. However, we found no
      evidence of isolation by distance. There was overall little genetic structure
      indicating ongoing and frequent gene flow among populations or a recent
      population expansion. Indeed, the neutrality test supported population expansion 
      in Laotian Ae. albopictus and mismatch distribution analyses showed a lack of low
      frequency alleles, a pattern often seen in bottlenecked populations. When samples
      from Lao PDR were analyzed together with samples from Thailand, China, Taiwan,
      Japan, Singapore, Italy and the USA, phylogenetic network and Bayesian cluster
      analysis showed that most populations from tropical/subtropical regions are more 
      genetically related to each other, than populations from temperate regions.
      Similarly, most populations from temperate regions are more genetically related
      to each other, than those from tropical/subtropical regions. CONCLUSIONS: Aedes
      albopictus in Lao PDR are genetically related to populations from
      tropical/subtropical regions (i.e. Thailand, Singapore, and California and Texas 
      in the USA). The extensive gene flow among locations in Lao PDR indicates that
      local control is undermined by repeated introductions from untreated sites.

TI  - Management of insecticide resistance in the major Aedes vectors of arboviruses:
      Advances and challenges.
PG  - e0007615
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007615 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The landscape of mosquito-borne disease risk has changed dramatically
      in recent decades, due to the emergence and reemergence of urban transmission
      cycles driven by invasive Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Insecticide
      resistance is already widespread in the yellow fever mosquito, Ae. Aegypti; is
      emerging in the Asian tiger mosquito Ae. Albopictus; and is now threatening the
      global fight against human arboviral diseases such as dengue, yellow fever,
      chikungunya, and Zika. Because the panel of insecticides available for public
      health is limited, it is of primary importance to preserve the efficacy of
      existing and upcoming active ingredients. Timely implementation of insecticide
      resistance management (IRM) is crucial to maintain the arsenal of effective
      public health insecticides and sustain arbovirus vector control. METHODOLOGY AND 
      PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This Review is one of a series being generated by the
      Worldwide Insecticide resistance Network (WIN) and aims at defining the
      principles and concepts underlying IRM, identifying the main factors affecting
      the evolution of resistance, and evaluating the value of existing tools for
      resistance monitoring. Based on the lessons taken from resistance strategies used
      for other vector species and agricultural pests, we propose a framework for the
      implementation of IRM strategies for Aedes mosquito vectors. CONCLUSIONS AND
      SIGNIFICANCE: Although IRM should be a fixture of all vector control programs, it
      is currently often absent from the strategic plans to control mosquito-borne
      diseases, especially arboviruses. Experiences from other public health disease
      vectors and agricultural pests underscore the need for urgent action in
      implementing IRM for invasive Aedes mosquitoes. Based on a plan developed for
      malaria vectors, here we propose some key activities to establish a global plan
      for IRM in Aedes spp.

AB  - It is currently challenging to analyze single-cell data consisting of many cells 
      and samples, and to address variations arising from batch effects and different
      sample preparations. For this purpose, we present SAUCIE, a deep neural network
      that combines parallelization and scalability offered by neural networks, with
      the deep representation of data that can be learned by them to perform many
      single-cell data analysis tasks. Our regularizations (penalties) render features 
      learned in hidden layers of the neural network interpretable. On large,
      multi-patient datasets, SAUCIE's various hidden layers contain denoised and
      batch-corrected data, a low-dimensional visualization and unsupervised
      clustering, as well as other information that can be used to explore the data. We
      analyze a 180-sample dataset consisting of 11 million T cells from dengue
      patients in India, measured with mass cytometry. SAUCIE can batch correct and
      identify cluster-based signatures of acute dengue infection and create a patient 
      manifold, stratifying immune response to dengue.

AB  - Cellular autophagy (Macrophagy) is a self-degradative process, executed through
      the network of autophagy associated genes (ATGs) encoded proteins. Both in vitro 
      and in vivo studies suggest that dengue virus (DENV) induces autophagy and
      supports the viral genome replication and translation. Therefore, the cellular
      autophagy induced by dengue virus can be a good target for antiviral drug
      development. The action of mycophenolic acid (MPA), a specific inhibitor of DENV 
      replication, was investigated in the stable BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells. The
      inhibition was mediated by enhanced degradation of autophagic substrates in
      stable BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells as evidenced by a decrease in lapidated LC3
      (LC3II) and p62 expression in the presence of MPA. In contrast, the results
      indicated that four gene sets, namely Transmembrane protein 74 (TMEM74),
      Unc-51-like kinase 2 (ULK2), Cathepsin D (CTSD) and Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1)
      were upregulated in stable BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells, due to the sustained
      dynamic replication of DENV2 genome. These ATGs involved in the
      pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) formation, were suppressed in the presence
      MPA. Instead, MPA induced the expression of different set of autophagy genes such
      as ATG4, AKT1, APP, ATG16L1, ATG16L2, B2M and HPRT1. An enzyme involved in the
      nucleotide salvage pathway, HPRT1, was highly expressed in the presence of MPA.
      The study shows that DENV2 replication is dependent on PAS formation and is
      inhibited in the presence of MPA by enhancing the degradation of autophagic
      substrates and suppression of PAS formation. This study provides impetus in
      designing MPA analogues to effectively inhibit dengue viral replication.

TI  - Globe-Trotting Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus: Risk Factors for Arbovirus
      Pandemics.
PG  - 71-81
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2019.2486 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Two species of Aedes (Ae.) mosquitoes (Ae. aegypti and Ae.
      albopictus) are primary vectors for emerging arboviruses that are a significant
      threat to public health and economic burden worldwide. Distribution of these
      vectors and the associated arboviruses, such as dengue virus, chikungunya virus, 
      yellow fever virus, and Zika virus, was for a long time restricted by
      geographical, ecological, and biological factors. Presently, arbovirus emergence 
      and dispersion are more rapid and geographically widespread, largely due to
      expansion of the range for these two mosquitoes that have exploited the global
      transportation network, land perturbation, and failure to contain the mosquito
      population coupled with enhanced vector competence. Ae. aegypti and Ae.
      albopictus may also sustain transmission between humans without having to depend 
      on their natural reservoir forest cycles due to arthropod adaptation to
      urbanization. Currently, there is no single strategy that is adequate to control 
      these vectors, especially when managing arbovirus outbreaks. Objective: This
      review aimed at presenting the characteristics and abilities of Ae. aegypti and
      Ae. albopictus, which can drive a global public health risk, and suggests
      strategies for prevention and control. Methods: This review presents the
      geographic range, reproduction and ecology, vector competence, genetic evolution,
      and biological and chemical control of these two mosquito species and how they
      have changed and developed over time combined with factors that may drive
      pandemics and mitigation measures. Conclusion: We suggest that more efforts
      should be geared toward the development of a concerted multidisciplinary
      approach.

AB  - Flaviviruses are a diverse group of arthropod-borne viruses responsible for
      numerous significant public health threats; therefore, understanding the
      interactions between these viruses and the human immune response remains vital.
      West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infect human dendritic cells (DCs)
      and can block antiviral immune responses in DCs. Previously, we used mRNA
      sequencing and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to define
      molecular signatures of antiviral DC responses following activation of innate
      immune signaling (RIG-I, MDA5, or type I interferon [IFN] signaling) or infection
      with WNV. Using this approach, we found that several genes involved in T cell
      cosignaling and antigen processing were not enriched in DCs during WNV infection.
      Using cis-regulatory sequence analysis, STAT5 was identified as a regulator of DC
      activation and immune responses downstream of innate immune signaling that was
      not activated during either WNV or ZIKV infection. Mechanistically, WNV and ZIKV 
      actively blocked STAT5 phosphorylation downstream of RIG-I, IFN-beta, and
      interleukin-4 (IL-4), but not granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
      (GM-CSF), signaling. Unexpectedly, dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 (DENV1 to DENV4)
      and the yellow fever 17D vaccine strain (YFV-17D) did not antagonize STAT5
      phosphorylation. In contrast to WNV, ZIKV inhibited JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylation
      following type I IFN treatment, suggesting divergent mechanisms used by these
      viruses to inhibit STAT5 activation. Combined, these findings identify STAT5 as a
      target of antagonism by specific pathogenic flaviviruses to subvert the immune
      response in infected DCs.IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses are a diverse group of
      insect-borne viruses responsible for numerous significant public health threats. 
      Previously, we used a computational biology approach to define molecular
      signatures of antiviral DC responses following activation of innate immune
      signaling or infection with West Nile virus (WNV). In this work, we identify
      STAT5 as a regulator of DC activation and antiviral immune responses downstream
      of innate immune signaling that was not activated during either WNV or Zika virus
      (ZIKV) infection. WNV and ZIKV actively blocked STAT5 phosphorylation downstream 
      of RIG-I, IFN-beta, and IL-4, but not GM-CSF, signaling. However, other related
      flaviviruses, dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 and the yellow fever 17D vaccine
      strain, did not antagonize STAT5 phosphorylation. Mechanistically, WNV and ZIKV
      showed differential inhibition of Jak kinases upstream of STAT5, suggesting
      divergent countermeasures to inhibit STAT5 activation. Combined, these findings
      identify STAT5 as a target of antagonism by specific pathogenic flaviviruses to
      subvert antiviral immune responses in human DCs.

AB  - High-throughput multi-omics studies and corresponding network analyses of
      multi-omic data have rapidly expanded their impact over the last 10 years. As
      biological features of different types (e.g. transcripts, proteins, metabolites) 
      interact within cellular systems, the greatest amount of knowledge can be gained 
      from networks that incorporate multiple types of -omic data. However, biological 
      and technical sources of variation diminish the ability to detect cross-type
      associations, yielding networks dominated by communities comprised of nodes of
      the same type. We describe here network building methods that can maximize edges 
      between nodes of different data types leading to integrated networks, networks
      that have a large number of edges that link nodes of different-omic types
      (transcripts, proteins, lipids etc). We systematically rank several network
      inference methods and demonstrate that, in many cases, using a random forest
      method, GENIE3, produces the most integrated networks. This increase in
      integration does not come at the cost of accuracy as GENIE3 produces networks of 
      approximately the same quality as the other network inference methods tested
      here. Using GENIE3, we also infer networks representing antibody-mediated Dengue 
      virus cell invasion and receptor-mediated Dengue virus invasion. A number of
      functional pathways showed centrality differences between the two networks
      including genes responding to both GM-CSF and IL-4, which had a higher centrality
      value in an antibody-mediated vs. receptor-mediated Dengue network. Because a
      biological system involves the interplay of many different types of molecules,
      incorporating multiple data types into networks will improve their use as models 
      of biological systems. The methods explored here are some of the first to
      specifically highlight and address the challenges associated with how such
      multi-omic networks can be assembled and how the greatest number of interactions 
      can be inferred from different data types. The resulting networks can lead to the
      discovery of new host response patterns and interactions during viral infection, 
      generate new hypotheses of pathogenic mechanisms and confirm mechanisms of
      disease.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the deadly arboviruses, which is primarily
      transmitted by Aedes aegypti, and causes dengue infection to the humans.
      According to WHO, every year around 390 million humans are affected by DENV, of
      which around 50 million deaths are reported. Knowledge of the various diseases
      caused by the DENV would greatly encourage to understand the infection mechanism 
      and help to design new antiviral drug discovery. We propose a quasi-clique and
      quasi-biclique algorithm to classify infection gateway proteins of the human body
      and possible pathways of DENV leading to various diseases. For this, we have
      examined three networks, dengue-human protein-protein interaction network, human 
      protein interaction network, and human proteins-disease association network. The 
      prediction result states that DENV may lead to various diseases in the human
      body, including cancer, asthma, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis, premature
      birth, and so on. Some of the results have recently been validated
      experimentally. This study may endow with potential targets for more effective
      anti-dengue remedial contribution.

AB  - The Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN) convened vaccine
      manufacturing experts and leaders from local and global public health
      organizations for its 19th Annual General Meeting. Lectures and panel discussions
      centered on international cooperation for better access to vaccines, and
      partnerships in areas ranging from vaccine research and process development, to
      clinical studies, regulatory, supply chain and emergency preparedness and
      response. Global vaccine market trends and changes that will impact vaccine
      financing and procurement methods were discussed as well as capital sources,
      including funding, for the development of new or improved vaccines. DCVMN members
      presented their progress in developing novel Hexavalent, Meningitis, Pneumococcal
      Conjugate Vaccine, Shigella, Mumps, Rotavirus, Yellow Fever, Polio, Hepatitis E
      and Dengue vaccines, and a novel monoclonal antibody cocktail for post-bite
      prophylaxis against rabies infections. Access to and availability of vaccines is 
      enhanced through sharing of best practices for vaccine quality control, reducing 
      redundant testing and promoting development of harmonized common standards.
      Eligible stakeholders were encouraged to join the WHO-National Control Laboratory
      Network for Biologicals which serves as a platform for collaboration and
      technical exchange in this area. Increasing regulatory convergence at the
      regional and global levels through mechanisms such as joint dossier review and
      the WHO Collaborative Registration Procedure can help to accelerate vaccine
      access globally. Additionally, four proposals for streamlining procedures and
      alignment of dossiers were discussed. Successful partnerships between a broad
      range of stakeholders, including international organizations, manufacturers,
      academic research institutes and regulators have provided support for, and in
      some cases accelerated, vaccine innovation, clinical trials and registration, WHO
      prequalification, vaccine introduction and access. Strong partnerships, based on 
      experience and trust, help leverage opportunities and are critically important to
      advancing the shared goal of providing quality vaccines for all people.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We present a narrative review of recent work on the utilisation of
      Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the analysis of social media (including
      online health communities) specifically for public health applications. METHODS: 
      We conducted a literature review of NLP research that utilised social media or
      online consumer-generated text for public health applications, focussing on the
      years 2016 to 2018. Papers were identified in several ways, including PubMed
      searches and the inspection of recent conference proceedings from the Association
      of Computational Linguistics (ACL), the Conference on Human Factors in Computing 
      Systems (CHI), and the International AAAI (Association for the Advancement of
      Artificial Intelligence) Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM). Popular data
      sources included Twitter, Reddit, various online health communities, and
      Facebook. RESULTS: In the recent past, communicable diseases (e.g., influenza,
      dengue) have been the focus of much social media-based NLP health research.
      However, mental health and substance use and abuse (including the use of tobacco,
      alcohol, marijuana, and opioids) have been the subject of an increasing volume of
      research in the 2016 - 2018 period. Associated with this trend, the use of
      lexicon-based methods remains popular given the availability of psychologically
      validated lexical resources suitable for mental health and substance abuse
      research. Finally, we found that in the period under review "modern" machine
      learning methods (i.e. deep neural-network-based methods), while increasing in
      popularity, remain less widely used than "classical" machine learning methods.

AB  - Objectives: Dengue epidemic is a dynamic and complex phenomenon that has gained
      considerable attention due to its injurious effects. The focus of this study is
      to statically analyze the nature of the dengue epidemic network in terms of
      whether it follows the features of a scale-free network or a random network.
      Methods: A multifarious network of Aedes aegypti is addressed keeping the
      viewpoint of a complex system and modelled as a network. The dengue network has
      been transformed into a one-mode network from a two-mode network by utilizing
      projection methods. Furthermore, three network features have been analyzed, the
      power-law, clustering coefficient, and network visualization. In addition, five
      methods have been applied to calculate the global clustering coefficient.
      Results: It has been observed that dengue epidemic follows a power-law, with the 
      value of its exponent gamma = -2.1. The value of the clustering coefficient is
      high for dengue cases, as weight of links. The minimum method showed the highest 
      value among the methods used to calculate the coefficient. Network visualization 
      showed the main areas. Moreover, the dengue situation did not remain the same
      throughout the observed period. Conclusions: The results showed that the network 
      topology exhibits the features of a scale-free network instead of a random
      network. Focal hubs are highlighted and the critical period is found. Outcomes
      are important for the researchers, health officials, and policy makers who deal
      with arbovirus epidemic diseases. Zika virus and Chikungunya virus can also be
      modelled and analyzed in this manner.

TI  - Evaluating the effects of control interventions and estimating the inapparent
      infections for dengue outbreak in Hangzhou, China.
PG  - e0220391
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0220391 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of dengue fever (DF) cases and the number of dengue
      outbreaks have increased in recent years in Zhejiang Province, China. An
      unexpected dengue outbreak was reported in Hangzhou in 2017 and caused more than 
      one thousand dengue cases. This study was undertaken to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the actual control measures, estimate the proportion of
      inapparent infections during this outbreak and simulate epidemic development
      based on different levels of control measures taking inapparent infections into
      consideration. METHODS: The epidemic data of dengue cases in Hangzhou, Zhejiang
      Province, in 2017 and the number of the people exposed to the outbreaks were
      obtained from the China Information Network System of Disease Prevention and
      Control. The epidemic without intervention measures was used to estimate the
      unknown parameters. A susceptible-exposed-infectious/inapparent-recovered (SEIAR)
      model was used to estimate the effectiveness of the control interventions. The
      inapparent infections were also evaluated at the same time. RESULTS: In total,
      1137 indigenous dengue cases were reported in Hangzhou in 2017. The number of
      indigenous dengue cases was estimated by the SEIAR model. This number was
      predicted to reach 6090 by the end of November 2, 2017, if no control measures
      were implemented. The total number of reported cases was reduced by 81.33% in
      contrast to the estimated incidence without intervention. The number of average
      daily inapparent cases was 10.18 times higher than the number of symptomatic
      cases. The earlier and more rigorously the vector control interventions were
      implemented, the more effective they were. The results showed that implementing
      vector control continuously for more than twenty days was more effective than
      every few days of implementation. Case isolation is not sufficient enough for
      epidemic control and only reduced the incidence by 38.10% in contrast to the
      estimated incidence without intervention, even if case isolation began seven days
      after the onset of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: The practical control
      interventions in the outbreaks that occurred in Hangzhou City were highly
      effective. The proportion of inapparent infections was large, and it played an
      important role in transmitting the disease during this epidemic. Early,
      continuous and high efficacy vector control interventions are necessary to limit 
      the development of a dengue epidemic. Timely diagnosis and case reporting are
      important in the intervention at an early stage of the epidemic.

TI  - Ovicidal lectins from Moringa oleifera and Myracrodruon urundeuva cause
      alterations in chorionic surface and penetrate the embryos of Aedes aegypti eggs.
PG  - 730-736
LID - 10.1002/ps.5572 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lectins from Moringa oleifera seeds (WSMoL), Myracrodruon urundeuva
      bark (MuBL), and heartwood (MuHL) are larvicidal agents against Aedes aegypti; in
      addition, WSMoL is an ovicidal agent against this mosquito. In this work, we
      evaluated the ovicidal activity of MuBL and MuHL by determining the
      concentrations that reduce the hatching rates by 50% in 72 h (EC50 ). The effects
      of WSMoL, MuBL, and MuHL on the ultrastructure of the eggs' surface were assessed
      by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the ability of these lectins 
      to penetrate the eggs was investigated by using conjugates of the lectins with
      fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). RESULTS: MuBL and MuHL were ovicidal agents
      with EC50 of 0.26 and 0.80 mg/mL (260 and 800 ppm), respectively. SEM images of
      eggs treated with WSMoL for 24 h revealed discontinuity of the exochorionic
      network and the absence of the exochorionic cells and their tubercles. After 48
      and 72 h of incubation, strong deformation and degeneration of egg surfaces were 
      observed. In MuBL and MuHL-treated eggs, the presence of lumps on the surface of 
      the eggs, disappearance of the exochorionic network and the decrease and
      deformation of tubercles were observed. Lastly, fluorescence microscopy revealed 
      that the three lectins were able to enter the eggs and reach the digestive tract 
      of the embryos. CONCLUSION: WSMoL, MuBL, and MuHL are ovicidal agents on A.
      aegypti that have differing efficiencies in terms of how they cause alterations
      in the chorionic surface and in terms of their ability to penetrate the eggs. (c)

      images.
PG  - e0007555
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007555 [doi]
AB  - Targeted environmental and ecosystem management remain crucial in control of
      dengue. However, providing detailed environmental information on a large scale to
      effectively target dengue control efforts remains a challenge. An important piece
      of such information is the extent of the presence of potential dengue vector
      breeding sites, which consist primarily of open containers such as ceramic jars, 
      buckets, old tires, and flowerpots. In this paper we present the design and
      implementation of a pipeline to detect outdoor open containers which constitute
      potential dengue vector breeding sites from geotagged images and to create highly
      detailed container density maps at unprecedented scale. We implement the approach
      using Google Street View images which have the advantage of broad coverage and of
      often being two to three years old which allows correlation analyses of container
      counts against historical data from manual surveys. Containers comprising eight
      of the most common breeding sites are detected in the images using convolutional 
      neural network transfer learning. Over a test set of images the object
      recognition algorithm has an accuracy of 0.91 in terms of F-score. Container
      density counts are generated and displayed on a decision support dashboard.
      Analyses of the approach are carried out over three provinces in Thailand. The
      container counts obtained agree well with container counts from available manual 
      surveys. Multi-variate linear regression relating densities of the eight
      container types to larval survey data shows good prediction of larval index
      values with an R-squared of 0.674. To delineate conditions under which the
      container density counts are indicative of larval counts, a number of factors
      affecting correlation with larval survey data are analyzed. We conclude that
      creation of container density maps from geotagged images is a promising approach 
      to providing detailed risk maps at large scale.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Transmission Patterns and Determinants of Dengue Fever: A Case
      Study of Guangzhou, China.
LID - E2486 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph16142486 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever is one of the most common vector-borne diseases in the world and is 
      mainly affected by the interaction of meteorological, human and land-use factors.
      This study aims to identify the impact of meteorological, human and land-use
      factors on dengue fever cases, involving the interplay between multiple factors. 
      The analyses identified the statistically significant determinants affecting the 
      transmission of dengue fever, employing cross-correlation analysis and the
      geo-detector model. This study was conducted in Guangzhou, China, using the data 
      of confirmed cases of dengue fever, daily meteorological records, population
      density distribution and land-use distribution. The findings highlighted that the
      dengue fever hotspots were mainly distributed in the old city center of Guangzhou
      and were significantly shaped by meteorological, land-use and human factors.
      Meteorological factors including minimum temperature, maximum temperature,
      atmospheric pressure and relative humidity were correlated with the transmission 
      of dengue fever. Minimum temperature, maximum temperature and relative humidity
      presented a statistically significant positive correlation with dengue fever
      cases, while atmospheric pressure presented statistically significant negative
      correlation. Minimum temperature, maximum temperature, atmospheric pressure and
      humidity have lag effects on the transmission of dengue fever. The population,
      community age, subway network density, road network density and ponds presented a
      statistically significant positive correlation with the number of dengue fever
      cases, and the interaction among land-use and human factors could enhance dengue 
      fever transmission. The ponds were the most important interaction factors, which 
      might strengthen the influence of other factors on dengue fever transmission. Our
      findings have implications for pre-emptive dengue fever control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ensemble building is a common method to improve the performance
      of the model in case of regression as well as classification. OBJECTIVE: In this 
      paper we propose a weighted average ensemble model to predict the number of
      incidence for infectious diseases like typhoid and compare it with applied models
      for prediction. METHODS: The Monthly data of dengue and typhoid cases from 2014
      to 2017 were taken from integrated diseases surveillance programme, Government of
      India. The data was processed by three regressions such as support vector
      regression, neural network and linear regression. RESULTS: To evaluate the
      prediction error and compare it with different models, different performance
      measures have been used such as MSE, RMSE and MAE and it was found that proposed 
      ensemble method performed better in terms of forecast measures. CONCLUSION: Our
      main aim in this paper is to minimize the prediction error; the resulting
      proposed weighted average ensemble model has shown a significant result in terms 
      of prediction errors.

TI  - Towards harmonisation of entomological surveillance in the Mediterranean area.
PG  - e0007314
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007314 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean Basin is historically a hotspot for trade,
      transport, and migration. As a result, countries surrounding the Mediterranean
      Sea share common public health threats. Among them are vector-borne diseases, and
      in particular, mosquito-borne viral diseases are prime candidates as (re)emerging
      diseases and are likely to spread across the area. Improving preparedness and
      response capacities to these threats at the regional level is therefore a major
      issue. The implementation of entomological surveillance is, in particular, of
      utmost importance. Guidance in designing entomological surveillance systems is
      critical, and these systems may pursue different specific objectives depending on
      the disease. The purpose of the proposed review is to draw up guidelines for
      designing effective and sustainable entomological surveillance systems in order
      to improve preparedness and response. However, we make it clear that there is no 
      universal surveillance system, so the thinking behind harmonisation is to define 
      evidence-based standards in order to promote best practises, identify the most
      appropriate surveillance activities, and optimise the use of resources. Such
      guidance is aimed at policymakers and diverse stakeholders and is intended to be 
      used as a framework for the implementation of entomological surveillance
      programmes. It will also be useful to collaborate and share information with
      health professionals involved in other areas of disease surveillance. Medical
      entomologists and vector control professionals will be able to refer to this
      report to advocate for tailored entomological surveillance strategies. The main
      threats targeted in this review are the vectors of dengue virus, chikungunya
      virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Rift Valley fever virus. The vectors of
      all these arboviruses are mosquitoes. METHODS: Current knowledge on vector
      surveillance in the Mediterranean area is reviewed. The analysis was carried out 
      by a collaboration of the medical entomology experts in the region, all of whom
      belong to the MediLabSecure network, which is currently funded by the European
      Union and represents an international effort encompassing 19 countries in the
      Mediterranean and Black Sea region. FINDINGS: Robust surveillance systems are
      required to address the globalisation of emerging arboviruses. The prevention and
      management of mosquito-borne viral diseases must be addressed in the prism of a
      One Health strategy that includes entomological surveillance as an integral part 
      of the policy. Entomological surveillance systems should be designed according to
      the entomological and epidemiological context and must have well-defined
      objectives in order to effect a tailored and graduated response. We therefore
      rely on different scenarios according to different entomological and
      epidemiological contexts and set out detailed objectives of surveillance. The
      development of multidisciplinary networks involving both academics and public
      authorities will provide resources to address these health challenges by
      promoting good practises in surveillance (identification of surveillance aims,
      design of surveillance systems, data collection, dissemination of surveillance
      results, evaluation of surveillance activities) and through the sharing of
      effective knowledge and information. These networks will also contribute to
      capacity building and stronger collaborations between sectors at both the local
      and regional levels. Finally, concrete guidance is offered on the vector of the
      main arbovirus based on the current situation in the area.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a human arboviral pathogen accounting for 390 million
      infections every year. The available vaccine has limited efficacy, and
      DENV-specific drugs have not been generated. To better understand DENV-host cell 
      interaction, we employed RNA interference-based screening of the human kinome and
      identified fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) to control the DENV
      replication cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of FGFR exerts a reciprocal effect 
      by reducing DENV RNA replication and promoting the production of infectious virus
      particles. Addressing the latter effect, we found that the FGFR signaling pathway
      modulates intracellular distribution of DENV particles in a PI3K-dependent
      manner. Upon FGFR inhibition, virions accumulate in the trans-Golgi network
      compartment, where they undergo enhanced maturation cleavage of the envelope
      protein precursor membrane (prM), rendering virus particles more infectious. This
      study reveals an unexpected reciprocal role of a cellular receptor tyrosine
      kinase regulating DENV RNA replication and the production of infectious virions.

AB  - Typical spatial disease surveillance systems associate a single address to each
      disease case reported, usually the residence address. Social network data offers 
      a unique opportunity to obtain information on the spatial movements of
      individuals as well as their disease status as cases or controls. This provides
      information to identify visit locations with high risk of infection, even in
      regions where no one lives such as parks and entertainment zones. We develop two 
      probability models to characterize the high-risk regions. We use a large Twitter 
      dataset from Brazilian users to search for spatial clusters through analysis of
      the tweets' locations and textual content. We apply our models to both real-world
      and simulated data, demonstrating the advantage of our models as compared to the 
      usual spatial scan statistic for this type of data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe stress can have drastic and systemic effects with dire
      implications on the health and wellbeing of exposed individuals. Particularly,
      the effect of stress on the immune response to infection is of interest to public
      health because of its implications for vaccine efficacy and treatment strategies 
      during stressful scenarios. Severe stress has previously been shown to cause an
      anergic state in the immune system that persists following exposure to a potent
      mitogen. METHODS: Transcriptome and microRNA changes were characterized using
      blood samples collected from U.S. Army Ranger candidates immediately before and
      after training, followed by exposure to representative pathogenic agents:
      Yersinia pestis, dengue virus 2, and Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). We
      employed experimental and computational approaches to characterize altered gene
      expression, processes, pathways, and regulatory networks mediating the host's
      response towards severe stress; to assess the protective immunity status of the
      stressed host towards infection; and to identify pathogen-induced biomarkers
      under severe stress conditions. RESULTS: We observed predicted inhibition of
      pathways significantly associated with lymphopoiesis, wound healing, inflammatory
      response, lymphocyte activation, apoptosis, and predicted activation of oxidative
      stress. Using weighted correlation network analyses, we demonstrated preservation
      of these pathways across infection and stress combinations. Regulatory networks
      comprising a common set of upstream regulators: transcription factors, microRNAs 
      and post-translational regulators (kinases and phosphatases) may be drivers of
      molecular alterations leading to compromised protective immunity. Other sets of
      transcripts were persistently altered in both the pre- and post-stress conditions
      due to the host's response to each pathogenic agent, forming specific molecular
      signatures with the potential to distinguish infection from that of severe
      stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that severe stress alters molecules
      implicated in the development of leukopoietic stem cells, thereby leading to
      depletion of cellular and molecular repertoires of protective immunity.
      Suppressed molecules mediating membrane trafficking of recycling endosomes,
      membrane translocation and localization of the antigen processing mechanisms and 
      cell adhesions indicate suboptimal antigen presentation, impaired formation of
      productive immunological synapses, and inhibited T-cell activations. These
      factors may collectively be responsible for compromised protective immunity
      (infection susceptibility, delayed wound healing, and poor vaccine response)
      observed in people under severe stress.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes aegypti populations in Brazil have been subjected to
      insecticide selection pressures with variable levels and sources since 1967.
      Therefore, the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) coordinated the activities of
      an Ae. aegypti insecticide resistance monitoring network (MoReNAa) from 1999 to
      2012. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to consolidate all information 
      available from between 1985 and 2017 regarding the resistance status and
      mechanisms of Brazilian Ae. aegypti populations against the main insecticide
      compounds used at the national level, including the larvicide temephos (an
      organophosphate) and the adulticide deltamethrin (a pyrethroid). METHODS: Data
      were gathered from two sources: a bibliographic review of studies published from 
      1985 to 2017, and unpublished data produced by our team within the MoReNAa
      between 1998 and 2012. A total of 146 municipalities were included, many of which
      were evaluated several times, totalling 457 evaluations for temephos and 274 for 
      deltamethrin. Insecticide resistance data from the five Brazilian regions were
      examined separately using annual records of both the MoH supply of insecticides
      to each state and the dengue incidence in each evaluated municipality. FINDINGS: 
      Ae. aegypti resistance to temephos and deltamethrin, the main larvicide and
      adulticide, respectively, employed against mosquitoes in Brazil for a long time, 
      was found to be widespread in the country, although with some regional
      variations. Comparisons between metabolic and target-site resistance mechanisms
      showed that one or another of these was the main component of pesticide
      resistance in each studied population. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: (i) A robust dataset on 
      the assessments of the insecticide resistance of Brazilian Ae. aegypti
      populations performed since 1985 was made available through our study. (ii) Our
      findings call into question the efficacy of chemical control as the sole
      methodology of vector control. (iii) It is necessary to ensure that sustainable
      insecticide resistance monitoring is maintained as a key component of integrated 
      vector management. (iv) Consideration of additional parameters, beyond the supply
      of insecticides distributed by the MoH or the diverse local dynamics of dengue
      incidence, is necessary to find consistent correlations with heterogeneous vector
      resistance profiles.

AB  - Dengue-related renal manifestations such as proteinuria, hematuria in the absence
      of thrombocytopenia, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury (AKI) are not
      uncommon. There is relatively sparse data on the renal manifestations of dengue
      viral infection (DVI). Hence, a retrospective study was conducted to investigate 
      the incidence, characteristics, and clinical outcome of DVI with renal
      manifestations. A total of 2416 patients were admitted to our hospital with the
      diagnosis of dengue fever during the study period from 2012 to 2015. Data were
      collected from the electronic medical records and were analyzed retrospectively. 
      The disease severity was classified according to the World Health Organization
      criteria. The renal manifestations were divided into AKI and non-AKI groups using
      AKI Network (AKIN) criteria. Proteinuria was defined as urinary protein >1+ (30
      mg/dL) by dipstick test. A total of 218 patients were found to have proteinuria
      (9.56%). Most of the patients [135 (58.44%) with renal manifestations] were aged 
      between 15 and 30 years. Comorbid conditions including diabetes mellitus,
      hypertension, and ischemic heart disease were seen in 10 (4.31%), 11 (4.76%), and
      six (2.59%) patients, respectively. Nephrotic-range proteinuria was seen in five 
      patients (2.16%). AKI was seen in 82 patients (3.4%); 58 (70.73%) had AKIN-I, 19 
      (23.17%) had AKIN-II, and five patients (6.09%) had AKIN-III. Death occurred in
      11 patients (39.28%) with AKI. The incidence of renal manifestations
      (proteinuria, hematuria, and AKI) is high at 9.59% among patients with dengue,
      and those with AKI had significant morbidity, mortality, longer hospital stay,
      and poor renal outcomes. Our findings suggest that AKI in dengue is likely to
      increase health-care burden that underscores the need for clinician's alertness
      to this highly morbid and potentially fatal complication for optimal prevention
      and management.

AB  - Type I interferon (IFN-I) is critical for antiviral defense, and plasmacytoid
      dendritic cells (pDCs) are a predominant source of IFN-I during virus infection. 
      pDC-mediated antiviral responses are stimulated upon physical contact with
      infected cells, during which immunostimulatory viral RNA is transferred to pDCs, 
      leading to IFN production via the nucleic acid sensor TLR7. Using dengue,
      hepatitis C, and Zika viruses, we demonstrate that the contact site of pDCs with 
      infected cells is a specialized platform we term the interferogenic synapse,
      which enables viral RNA transfer and antiviral responses. This synapse is formed 
      via alphaLbeta2 integrin-ICAM-1 adhesion complexes and the recruitment of the
      actin network and endocytic machinery. TLR7 signaling in pDCs promotes
      interferogenic synapse establishment and provides feed-forward regulation,
      sustaining pDC contacts with infected cells. This interferogenic synapse may
      allow pDCs to scan infected cells and locally secrete IFN-I, thereby confining a 
      potentially deleterious response.

PG  - 146
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2019.00146 [doi]
AB  - Co-expression analysis has been widely used to elucidate the functional
      architecture of genes under different biological processes. Such analysis,
      however, requires substantial knowledge about programming languages and/or
      bioinformatics skills. We present webCEMiTool, a unique online tool that performs
      comprehensive modular analyses in a fully automated manner. The webCEMiTool not
      only identifies co-expression gene modules but also performs several functional
      analyses on them. In addition, webCEMiTool integrates transcriptomic data with
      interactome information (i.e., protein-protein interactions) and identifies
      potential hubs on each network. The tool generates user-friendly html reports
      that allow users to search for specific genes in each module, as well as check if
      a module contains genes overrepresented in specific pathways or altered in a
      specific sample phenotype. We used webCEMiTool to perform a modular analysis of
      single-cell RNA-seq data of human cells infected with either Zika virus or dengue
      virus.

TI  - Dengue Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Among Arizona Health Care Providers,
      2014-2015.
PG  - 434-440
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2018.2370 [doi]
AB  - Background: Detection of local dengue transmission requires an aware and engaged 
      medical community, as health care providers are the front line of public health
      surveillance. To assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice about dengue, an
      online survey was distributed among Arizona health care providers during 2014 and
      2015. Materials and Methods: The survey consisted of a total of 10 knowledge,
      attitude, and practice questions divided as follows: 5 knowledge questions, 2
      attitude questions, and 3 practice questions. The link to the Qualtrics survey
      was distributed through the Arizona Health Alert Network to a total of 4582
      e-mail addresses, of which 335 participants opened the survey, and 196 completed 
      and submitted their responses. Results: Less than half the respondents reported
      choosing the right dengue diagnostic test (40.4%) or understanding the
      epidemiology of dengue in Arizona (40.9%). Slightly more than half the
      respondents reported frequently asking for travel history (59%), and three-fourth
      of them would notify the local health department on suspicion of a dengue patient
      (76.1%). Survey score was associated with providers specialized in infectious
      diseases (1.88, 95% CI: 0.42-3.33, p = 0.01), medical doctors or doctors of
      osteopathic medicine (1.82, 95% CI: 0.98-2.65, p < 0.0001), and respondents who
      reported to have heard about the increase in dengue cases in Sonora (Mexico) in
      fall 2014 (1.51, 95% CI: 0.67-2.34, p = 0.0005), indicating better survey
      performance. Conclusions: These results indicate that education for health care
      providers on dengue should be improved particularly among general practice
      noninfectious disease providers who might be the first point of care for dengue
      patients. Findings suggest that additional training on clinical management,
      asking travel history, and notifying the local health department on suspicion of 
      a dengue patient are needed.

LID - 10.1109/TBME.2019.2897285 [doi]
AB  - Dengue has become one of the most important worldwide arthropod-borne diseases.
      Dengue phenotypes are based on laboratorial and clinical exams, which are known
      to be inaccurate. OBJECTIVE: We present a machine learning approach for the
      prediction of dengue fever severity based solely on human genome data. METHODS:
      One hundred and two Brazilian dengue patients and controls were genotyped for 322
      innate immunity single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our model uses a support 
      vector machine algorithm to find the optimal loci classification subset and then 
      an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to classify patients into dengue fever
      or severe dengue. RESULTS: The ANN trained on 13 key immune SNPs selected under
      dominant or recessive models produced median values of accuracy greater than 86%,
      and sensitivity and specificity over 98% and 51%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The
      proposed classification method, using only genome markers, can be used to
      identify individuals at high risk for developing the severe dengue phenotype even
      in uninfected conditions. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that the genetic
      context is a key element in phenotype definition in dengue. The methodology
      proposed here is extendable to other Mendelian based and genetically influenced
      diseases.

      DF outbreaks are investigated for the presence of NS1 antigen or IgM antibodies
      against dengue. The data were analyzed to describe the distribution of DF by time
      (month and year), place (district and state) and person (age and sex)
      characteristics. RESULTS: Between 2014-2017, VRDLs investigated 211,432 suspected
      DF patients, 28.4% of whom were serologically confirmed. The median age of dengue
      positive patients was 25 years (IQR: 16-36). Dengue positivity was significantly 
      higher among males. The mean monthly dengue positivity ranged from 7.7% to 37%,
      with higher positivity reported during September and October months. VRDLs
      provided diagnosis to 190 suspected outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: The data from the
      VRDL network indicate dengue was the etiology in one-fourth of AFI cases. Dengue 
      was the second commonest etiology of suspected outbreaks diagnosed by VRDLs.

AB  - Dengue, chikungunya and Zika are arboviruses transmitted by mosquitos of the
      genus Aedes and have caused several outbreaks in world over the past ten years.
      Morphological identification of mosquitos is currently restricted due to the
      small number of adequately trained professionals. We implemented a computational 
      model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from
      mosquito images to identify adult mosquitoes from the species Aedes aegypti,
      Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus. To train the CNN to perform
      automatic morphological classification of mosquitoes, we used a dataset that
      included 4,056 mosquito images. Three neural networks, including LeNet, AlexNet
      and GoogleNet, were used. During the validation phase, the accuracy of the
      mosquito classification was 57.5% using LeNet, 74.7% using AlexNet and 83.9%
      using GoogleNet. During the testing phase, the best result (76.2%) was obtained
      using GoogleNet; results of 52.4% and 51.2% were obtained using LeNet and
      AlexNet, respectively. Significantly, accuracies of 100% and 90% were achieved
      for the classification of Aedes and Culex, respectively. A classification
      accuracy of 82% was achieved for Aedes females. Our results provide information
      that is fundamental for the automatic morphological classification of adult
      mosquito species in field. The use of CNN's is an important method for autonomous
      identification and is a valuable and accessible resource for health workers and
      taxonomists for the identification of some insects that can transmit infectious
      agents to humans.

TI  - Alternative strategies for mosquito-borne arbovirus control.
PG  - e0006822
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006822 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mosquito-borne viruses-such as Zika, chikungunya, dengue fever, and
      yellow fever, among others-are of global importance. Although vaccine development
      for prevention of mosquito-borne arbovirus infections has been a focus,
      mitigation strategies continue to rely on vector control. However, vector control
      has failed to prevent recent epidemics and arrest expanding geographic
      distribution of key arboviruses, such as dengue. As a consequence, there has been
      increasing necessity to further optimize current strategies within integrated
      approaches and advance development of alternative, innovative strategies for the 
      control of mosquito-borne arboviruses. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This review,
      intended as a general overview, is one of a series being generated by the
      Worldwide Insecticide resistance Network (WIN). The alternative strategies
      discussed reflect those that are currently under evaluation for public health
      value by the World Health Organization (WHO) and represent strategies of focus by
      globally recognized public health stakeholders as potential insecticide
      resistance (IR)-mitigating strategies. Conditions where these alternative
      strategies could offer greatest public health value in consideration of
      mitigating IR will be dependent on the anticipated mechanism of action. Arguably,
      the most pressing need for endorsement of the strategies described here will be
      the epidemiological evidence of a public health impact. CONCLUSIONS: As the
      burden of mosquito-borne arboviruses, predominately those transmitted by Aedes
      aegypti and A. albopictus, continues to grow at a global scale, new
      vector-control tools and integrated strategies will be required to meet public
      health demands. Decisions regarding implementation of alternative strategies will
      depend on key ecoepidemiological parameters that each is intended to optimally
      impact toward driving down arbovirus transmission.

PG  - 637

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes aegypti is associated with dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya
      and Zika viruses. This vector is widespread in tropical and subtropical areas,
      and can also occur in temperate areas at higher latitudes. The geographical
      distribution of Ae. aegypti continues to spread due to human activities. This is 
      the first study to examine the population genetic structure of this insect in El 
      Salvador, Central America. METHODS: Aedes aegypti larvae were collected from six 
      geographical regions of El Salvador: Sonsonate, San Salvador, Chalatenango,
      Usulutan, San Miguel and Morazan. Larvae were raised into adults, identified and 
      preserved. Two molecular markers, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)
      genotyping and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1)
      sequencing, were used to investigate population genetic structure. RESULTS:
      Structure analysis found two genetically distinct populations; one occurs
      predominantly in the north and west, and a mix of two populations occurs in the
      southeast of the country. Genetic distances ranged from 0.028 (2.8%) to 0.091
      (9%), and an AMOVA analysis found 11% variation between populations.
      Mitochondrial DNA cox1 sequences produced a haplotype network which consisted of 
      3 haplogroups and 10 haplotypes. Haplogroup 1 had low haplotype and nucleotide
      diversity and was found in all six regions. Haplogroups 2 and 3 had higher
      haplotype and nucleotide diversity, and were less abundant; haplogroup 3 was
      found in only 3 of the six regions studied. Bottleneck tests were significant,
      suggesting that populations had undergone a recent bottleneck. A maximum
      likelihood tree, which combined samples from this study with available sequences 
      in GenBank, suggested that two genetically divergent lineages had been
      introduced. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively high genetic diversity was found in Ae.
      aegypti in El Salvador. The mtDNA sequences clustered into two lineages, as found
      in previous studies. Samples in El Salvador may be introduced from regions in
      North and South America where past eradication was not complete. Future study of 
      genotypes in surrounding countries would provide a more complete picture of the
      movement and potential source of introductions of this vector. The distribution
      of the lineages and haplogroups may further our understanding of the epidemiology
      of Ae. aegypti associated vector borne diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diseases caused by Aedes-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika,
      chikungunya, and yellow fever, are emerging and reemerging globally. The causes
      are multifactorial and include global trade, international travel, urbanisation, 
      water storage practices, lack of resources for intervention, and an inadequate
      evidence base for the public health impact of Aedes control tools. National
      authorities need comprehensive evidence-based guidance on how and when to
      implement Aedes control measures tailored to local entomological and
      epidemiological conditions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This review is one of a series 
      being conducted by the Worldwide Insecticide resistance Network (WIN). It
      describes a framework for implementing Integrated Aedes Management (IAM) to
      improve control of diseases caused by Aedes-borne viruses based on available
      evidence. IAM consists of a portfolio of operational actions and priorities for
      the control of Aedes-borne viruses that are tailored to different epidemiological
      and entomological risk scenarios. The framework has 4 activity pillars: (i)
      integrated vector and disease surveillance, (ii) vector control, (iii) community 
      mobilisation, and (iv) intra- and intersectoral collaboration as well as 4
      supporting activities: (i) capacity building, (ii) research, (iii) advocacy, and 
      (iv) policies and laws. CONCLUSIONS: IAM supports implementation of the World
      Health Organisation Global Vector Control Response (WHO GVCR) and provides a
      comprehensive framework for health authorities to devise and deliver sustainable,
      effective, integrated, community-based, locally adapted vector control strategies
      in order to reduce the burden of Aedes-transmitted arboviruses. The success of
      IAM requires strong commitment and leadership from governments to maintain
      proactive disease prevention programs and preparedness for rapid responses to
      outbreaks.

TI  - An open-source k-mer based machine learning tool for fast and accurate subtyping 
      of HIV-1 genomes.
PG  - e0206409
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0206409 [doi]
AB  - For many disease-causing virus species, global diversity is clustered into a
      taxonomy of subtypes with clinical significance. In particular, the
      classification of infections among the subtypes of human immunodeficiency virus
      type 1 (HIV-1) is a routine component of clinical management, and there are now
      many classification algorithms available for this purpose. Although several of
      these algorithms are similar in accuracy and speed, the majority are proprietary 
      and require laboratories to transmit HIV-1 sequence data over the network to
      remote servers. This potentially exposes sensitive patient data to unauthorized
      access, and makes it impossible to determine how classifications are made and to 
      maintain the data provenance of clinical bioinformatic workflows. We propose an
      open-source supervised and alignment-free subtyping method (Kameris) that
      operates on k-mer frequencies in HIV-1 sequences. We performed a detailed study
      of the accuracy and performance of subtype classification in comparison to four
      state-of-the-art programs. Based on our testing data set of manually curated
      real-world HIV-1 sequences (n = 2, 784), Kameris obtained an overall accuracy of 
      97%, which matches or exceeds all other tested software, with a processing rate
      of over 1,500 sequences per second. Furthermore, our fully standalone
      general-purpose software provides key advantages in terms of data security and
      privacy, transparency and reproducibility. Finally, we show that our method is
      readily adaptable to subtype classification of other viruses including dengue,
      influenza A, and hepatitis B and C virus.

AB  - Objective: To confirm the laboratory diagnosis of dengue bordline cases reported 
      in Henan Province and trace its origin from molecular level in 2017. Methods: The
      study samples were blood samples (3-5 ml), which came from 8 suspected cases of
      dengue fever reported in the 2017 direct reporting system of Henan provincial
      infectious disease monitoring network. Meanwhile, case investigation was
      conducted according to National dengue fever surveillance programme. Serum were
      separated from blood samples and tested for Dengue NS1 antigen, IgM & IgG
      antibodies, and dengue RNA. According to dengue diagnosis criteria, confirmed
      cases were identified by testing results. Samples carried dengue RNA performed
      for real-time PCR genotyping and amplification of E gene. Then, the amplicons
      were sequenced and homological and phylogenetic analyses were constructed.
      Results: 8 serum samples of suspected dengue cases were collected in Henan
      Province, 2017. Six of them were diagnosed as dengue confirmed cases. All the
      dengue confirmed cases belonged to outside imported cases, 5 of them were
      positive by dengue RNA testing. Genotyping results showed there were 1 DENV1
      case, 2 DENV2 cases and 2 DENV3 cases. A DENV2 case and a DENV3 case of this
      study were traced its origin successfully. The sequence of Pakistan imported
      DENV2 case belongs to cosmopolitan genotype, which was the most consistent with
      Pakistan's DENV2 KJ010186 in 2013 (identity 99.0%). The sequence of Malaysia
      imported DENV3 case belongs to genotype I, which was the most consistent with
      Singapore's DENV3 KX224276 in 2014(identity 99.0%). Conclusion: The laboratory
      diagnosis and molecular traceability of dengue cases in Henan Province in 2017
      confirmed that all cases were imported and did not cause local epidemics.

PG  - 50
LID - 10.1007/s11908-018-0656-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Dengue is found in tropics and subtropics that are considered 
      to be popular travel destinations. We set out to review the burden of dengue on
      international travelers. RECENT FINDINGS: GeoSentinel, a global network of travel
      medicine providers, has seen an increasing trend of dengue in returning travelers
      over the past decades. In Southeast Asia, annual proportionate morbidity
      increased from 50 dengue cases per 1000 ill-returned travelers in non-epidemic
      years to an average of 159 cases per 1000 travelers during epidemic years. Dengue
      is the leading cause of fever in returning travelers, having overtaken malaria
      for travelers to Southeast Asia. Most dengue seroconversion studies in travelers 
      report an attack rate of around 5% depending on duration of travel and
      destination. Dengue vaccination would be justified for travelers. The first
      licensed dengue vaccine CYD-TDV is only recommended in seropositive individuals. 
      This review considers preventive measures including how best to use the first
      licensed dengue vaccine CYD-TDV.

TI  - Screening for Zika virus RNA in sera of suspected cases: a retrospective
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 155
LID - 10.1186/s12985-018-1070-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) became a global human health concern owing to its
      rapid spread worldwide and its association with congenital and neurological
      disorders. The current epidemiological profile of arboviruses in Brazil is
      characterized by widespread co-circulation of Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus,
      and ZIKV throughout the country. These viruses cause acute diseases frequently
      with overlapping symptoms, which could result in an inaccurate diagnosis based
      solely on clinical and epidemiological grounds. Here we conducted a screening for
      ZIKV RNA in serum samples from patients across Brazil with suspected ZIKV
      infection. METHODS: Using RT-qPCR, we investigated ZIKV RNA in 3001 serum
      samples. Samples were passively acquired through a private laboratory network,
      between December 2015 and August 2016, from 27 Brazilian Federative Units. We
      performed descriptive statistics on demographic variables including sex, age, and
      geographic location. RESULTS: ZIKV was detected in 11.4% (95%CI = 10.3-12.6%) of 
      the sera. ZIKV RNA was detected in sera collected throughout the country, but
      during the analyzed period, RNA was more frequently detected in samples from the 
      Southeast, Midwest, and North regions (3.9 to 5.8 times higher) when compared to 
      the Northeast and South regions. CONCLUSIONS: These data reinforce the importance
      of laboratory diagnosis, surveillance systems, and further epidemiological
      studies to understand the dynamics of outbreaks and diseases associated with ZIKV
      and other arboviruses.

AB  - Dengue Fever has become an increasing public health concern around the world due 
      to its serious health consequences including death, lack of effective vaccine and
      specific treatment. Influence of area specific meteorological and physiographical
      characteristics on the spread of infectious diseases need to be studied to
      understand spatial-temporal aspects of infectious diseases in a particular area. 
      Mathematical relationships between various explanatory variables (causative
      factors) and Dengue Fever incidences have been established to quantify and
      prioritize the influence of various factors. So that, effective health care
      services could be provided in these areas. The study successfully explains the
      occurrences of Dengue Fever in Delhi in term of geo-spatial phenomena/variables. 
      Meteorological data of 13 stations in Delhi at hourly temporal scale for a period
      2006-2015 have been used along with multi-spectral satellite data. Data on
      reported cases of Dengue Fever on daily basis and for a period of ten years from 
      2006 to 2015 have been obtained for Delhi. Python modules have been developed to 
      extract values of geospatial parameters and to perform Poisson regression. To
      assess the accuracy of developed Poisson regression based equations, r-squared
      and error statistics have been calculated. Results indicate strong association of
      Dengue Fever incidences with temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunshine hours,
      built-up and vegetation density and distance from dairy locations, waterbodies
      and drainage network. Further, critical ranges of various parameters favouring
      high number of Dengue Fever incidences have been determined. These findings have 
      significant public health implications for control and prevention of Dengue Fever
      incidences in Delhi city and surrounding region. Occurrences of Dengue Fever
      incidences are found to be highest in the month of September and October. These
      months represent transition period from rainy season to winter season. It is
      recommended that further study should focus on detailed analysis of causative
      factors in this period.

AB  - Coronavirus 3C-like and Flavivirus NS2B-NS3 proteases utilize the chymotrypsin
      fold to harbor their catalytic machineries but also contain additional
      domains/co-factors. Over the past decade, we aimed to decipher how the extra
      domains/co-factors mediate the catalytic machineries of SARS 3C-like, Dengue and 
      Zika NS2B-NS3 proteases by characterizing their folding, structures, dynamics and
      inhibition with NMR, X-ray crystallography and MD simulations, and the results
      revealed: 1) the chymotrypsin fold of the SARS 3C-like protease can independently
      fold, while, by contrast, those of Dengue and Zika proteases lack the intrinsic
      capacity to fold without co-factors. 2) Mutations on the extra domain of SARS
      3C-like protease can transform the active catalytic machinery into the inactive
      collapsed state by structurally-driven allostery. 3) Amazingly, even without
      detectable structural changes, mutations on the extra domain are sufficient to
      either inactivate or enhance the catalytic machinery of SARS 3C-like protease by 
      dynamically-driven allostery. 4) Global networks of correlated motions have been 
      identified: for SARS 3C-like protease, N214A inactivates the catalytic machinery 
      by decoupling the network, while STI/A and STIF/A enhance by altering the
      patterns of the network. The global networks of Dengue and Zika proteases are
      coordinated by their NS2B-cofactors. 5) Natural products were identified to
      allosterically inhibit Zika and Dengue proteases through binding a pocket on the 
      back of the active site. Therefore, by introducing extra domains/cofactors,
      nature develops diverse strategies to regulate the catalytic machinery embedded
      on the chymotrypsin fold through folding, structurally- and dynamically-driven
      allostery, all of which might be exploited to develop antiviral drugs.

TI  - Illness among US resident student travellers after return to the USA: a
      GeoSentinel analysis, 2007-17.
LID - 10.1093/jtm/tay074 [doi]
AB  - Background: The number of US students studying abroad more than tripled during
      the past 20 years. As study abroad programmes' destinations diversify, students
      increasingly travel to resource-limited countries, placing them at risk for
      infectious diseases. Data describing infections acquired by US students while
      travelling internationally are limited. We describe illnesses among students who 
      returned from international travel and suggest how to prevent illness among these
      travellers. Methods: GeoSentinel is a global surveillance network of travel and
      tropical medicine providers that monitors travel-related morbidity. This study
      included the records of US resident student international travellers, 17-24 years
      old, who returned to the USA, had a confirmed travel-related illness at one of 15
      US GeoSentinel sites during 2007-17 and had a documented exposure region. Records
      were analysed to describe demographic and travel characteristics and diagnoses.
      Results: The study included 432 students. The median age was 21 years; 69% were
      female. More than 70% had a pre-travel consultation with a healthcare provider.
      The most common exposure region was sub-Saharan Africa (112; 26%). Students were 
      most commonly exposed in India (44; 11%), Ecuador (28; 7%), Ghana (25; 6%) and
      China (24; 6%). The median duration of travel abroad was 40 days (range: 1-469)
      and presented to a GeoSentinel site a median of 8 days (range: 0-181) after
      travel; 98% were outpatients. Of 581 confirmed diagnoses, the most common
      diagnosis category was gastrointestinal (45%). Acute diarrhoea was the most
      common gastrointestinal diagnosis (113 of 261; 43%). Thirty-one (7%) students had
      vector-borne diseases [14 (41%) malaria and 11 (32%) dengue]. Three had
      vaccine-preventable diseases (two typhoid; one hepatitis A); two had acute human 
      immunodeficiency virus infection. Conclusions: Students experienced
      travel-related infections, despite the majority having a pre-travel consultation.
      US students should receive pre-travel advice, vaccinations and chemoprophylaxis
      to prevent gastrointestinal, vector-borne, sexually transmitted and
      vaccine-preventable infections.

AB  - The growth of the world population has increased the demand for water. On the
      other hand, climate change shows us that the water sources that were previously
      safe are not anymore. There are inequalities between urban and rural areas, thus 
      96% of the urban world population uses drinking water sources compared to 84% of 
      the rural population, while 82% of the urban population versus 51% of the rural
      population use sanitation facilities. In Peru, 80.4% of homes are supplied with
      water through a public network. In the urban area, this service covers 83.2%;
      while in the rural area 71.3% of homes have a toilet service connected to the
      public network. All the above conditions the presence of water-related infectious
      diseases, such as diarrhea, malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis A,
      and E, whose classification is shown in this article. In the world, diarrhea is
      the third cause of death among children under five years of age and more than
      340,000 children under the age of five die from diarrheal diseases due to poor
      sanitation. One of the goals of the SDGs is related to universal access drinking 
      water, sanitation and hygiene, which cannot be achieved without due attention to 
      the inequalities in access observed between different groups, avoiding the
      consequences of these deficiencies both in our country and in the world.

TI  - Estimating air temperature using MODIS surface temperature images for assessing
      Aedes aegypti thermal niche in Bangkok, Thailand.
PG  - 537
LID - 10.1007/s10661-018-6875-0 [doi]
AB  - Dengue, the most widespread urban vector-borne disease, is transmitted to human
      by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Its distribution in urban areas is heterogeneous
      over time and space. In time, it is linked to seasonal variations such as warm
      and cold seasons, as well as rainy and dry seasons. In space, it is linked to
      social and environmental conditions, which alternate between rich and deprived
      neighborhoods, vegetated and densely built areas. These variations in terms of
      land cover can affect surface and air temperature. As a result of its influence
      on the mosquito's life cycle, temperature plays a crucial part in dengue
      epidemics potential. Thus, deciphering the thermal variations effects within
      cities could lead to the identification of precise thermal comfort zones,
      favorable to the survival of mosquito populations during inter-epidemic periods. 
      The maps that could be produced as a result would enable health authorities to
      target specific areas. Most cities are equipped with meteorological stations.
      However, the network is generally not dense enough to precisely identify thermal 
      comfort zones. Remote sensing can be used as a tool to solve this issue. The
      methodological objective of this paper is to assess the potential of the TVX
      (Temperature-Vegetation indeX) approach applied to MODIS thermal images for the
      purpose of estimating daily minimum and maximum air temperatures in the city of
      Bangkok, Thailand. The TVX approach has been seldom used over urban areas due to 
      the heterogeneous nature of cities in terms of land cover. However, our study
      shows that in vegetated cities such as Bangkok, the TVX method provides valuable 
      results which can be used to assess thermal niche of A. aegypti.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have been published in the western literature on the 
      incidence, clinical course and outcome of patients with ARDS. However, there is
      limited data about ARDS in the tropics and moreover, the etiology and outcomes of
      ARDS in tropical countries are different from those of western nations. In
      tropical countries like India, resources are limited and costs of therapy play a 
      major role in deciding treatment options. This prospective observational study
      was designed to analyze the clinical profile, outcomes and predictors of
      mortality of patients with ARDS in an urban tropical setting. METHODS: 75
      patients >/=13 years, admitted in the medical intensive care unit of a teaching
      hospital in Kerala, India between March 2013 and February 2014, satisfying Berlin
      definition for ARDS were enrolled in the study. Lung protective ventilation
      strategy as laid by ARDS Network protocol was followed for every patient on
      mechanical ventilation. Due to scarcity of ventilators in our institution,
      invasive ventilation could not be provided for all ARDS patients. The criteria
      used for patient selection for non-invasive ventilation were hemodynamic
      stability, well compliant to the use of NIV mask and PaO2/FiO2 ratio >180 at the 
      time of admission. RESULTS: Out of the 75 patients, 51% were females and the mean
      age of the study population was 39.8 +/- 3.3 years. Common aetiologies were
      leptospirosis (18.7%), bronchopneumonia (17.3%), scrub typhus and dengue (12%
      each). Lung injury score and sequential organ failure assessment score scores had
      statistically significant association with the severity of ARDS. Forty patients
      (53.3%) received invasive mechanical ventilation and 35 patients were managed
      with non-invasive ventilation at the time of admission. The mortality in our
      study was 45%. Altered sensorium (p-0.002), central cyanosis (p-0.024), elevated 
      creatinine (p-0.036), acidosis (p < 0.001), hypotension (p < 0.001), multiorgan
      dysfunction (p-0.017), PEEP >12 cm H2O (p-0.036), days on ventilator <7
      (p-0.014), PaO2/FiO2 Ratio <100 (p < 0.001), LIS>2.5 (p < 0.001) and SOFA
      score>11 (p < 0.001) were individual predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION:
      Tropical infections form a major etiological component of ARDS in a developing
      country like India. More studies are required for determining criteria for using 
      NIV in mild ARDS patients which would be helpful in resource limited countries.
      Timely administration of effective antimicrobial therapy in patients in the rural
      tropics may help to reduce mortality and financial burden due to ARDS.

TI  - Salivary Detection of Dengue Virus NS1 Protein with a Label-Free Immunosensor for
      Early Dengue Diagnosis.
LID - E2641 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s18082641 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a highly pathogenic, arthropod-borne virus transmitted
      between people by Aedes mosquitoes. Despite efforts to prevent global spread, the
      potential for DENV epidemics is increasing world-wide. Annually, 3.6 billion
      people are at risk of infection. With no licensed vaccine, early diagnosis of
      dengue infection is critical for clinical management and patient survival.
      Detection of DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a clinically accepted
      biomarker for the early detection of DENV infection. Unfortunately, virtually all
      of the laboratory and commercial DENV NS1 diagnostic methods require a blood draw
      for sample analysis, limiting point-of-care diagnostics and decreases patient
      willingness. Alternatively, NS1 in human saliva has been identified for the
      potential early diagnosis of DENV infection. The collection of saliva is simple, 
      non-invasive, painless, and inexpensive, even by minimally trained personnel. In 
      this study, we present a label-free chemiresistive immunosensor for the detection
      of the DENV NS1 protein utilizing a network of single-walled carbon nanotubes
      functionalized with anti-dengue NS1 monoclonal antibodies. NS1 was successfully
      detected in adulterated artificial human saliva over the range of clinically
      relevant concentrations with high sensitivity and selectivity. It has potential
      application in clinical diagnosis and the ease of collection allows for
      self-testing, even within the home.

TI  - Ten-years trend of dengue research in Indonesia and South-east Asian countries: a
      bibliometric analysis.
PG  - 1504398
LID - 10.1080/16549716.2018.1504398 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease with high incidence in
      over 128 countries. WHO estimates 500,000 people with severe dengue are
      hospitalized annually and 2.5% of those affected die. Indonesia is a hyperendemic
      country for dengue with an increasing number of cases in the last decade.
      Unfortunately, the trends of Indonesian dengue research are relatively unknown.
      OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to depict bibliographic trends and knowledge
      structure of dengue publications in Indonesia relative to that of South-east Asia
      (SEA) from 2007 to 2016. METHODS: Bibliographic data were collected from PubMed
      filtered by Indonesia country affiliation. The annual growth rate of publication 
      was measured and compared with neighborhood countries in the SEA region. Network 
      analysis was used to visualize emerging research issues. RESULTS: About 1,625
      dengue-related documents originated from SEA region, of which Indonesia
      contributed 5.90%. The publication growth rate in Indonesia, however, is the
      highest in ASEAN region (28.87%). Total citations for documents published from
      Indonesia was 980, with an average of 14 citations per publication and h-index of
      16. Within the first five years, the main research topics were related to insect 
      vector and diagnostic method. While insect vector remained dominant in the last
      five years, other topics such as disease outbreak, dengue virus, and dengue
      vaccine started emerging. CONCLUSION: In the last 10 years, dengue publications' 
      growth from Indonesia in international journals improved significantly, despite
      less number of publications compared to other SEA countries. Efforts should be
      made to improve the quantity and quality of publications from Indonesia. The
      research topics related to dengue in Indonesia are in line with studies in SEA.
      Stakeholders and policy makers are encouraged to develop a roadmap for dengue
      research in the future.

PG  - 2310-2321

AB  - In recent years, West Nile virus (WNV) has posed a great threat to global human
      health due to its explosive spread. Studying the protein-protein interactions
      (PPIs) between WNV and human is beneficial for understanding the pathogenesis of 
      WNV and the immune response mechanism of human against WNV infection at the
      molecular level. In this study, we identified the human target proteins which
      interact with WNV based on protein structure similarity, and then the interacting
      pairs were filtered by the subcellular co-localization information. As a result, 
      a network of 3346 interactions was constructed, involving 6 WNV proteins and 1970
      human target proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first predicted interactome 
      for WNV-human. By analyzing the topological properties and evolutionary rates of 
      the human target proteins, it was demonstrated that these proteins tend to be the
      hub and bottleneck proteins in the human PPI network and are more conserved than 
      the non-target ones. Triplet analysis showed that the target proteins are
      adjacent to each other in the human PPI network, suggesting that these proteins
      may have similar biological functions. Further, the functional enrichment
      analysis indicated that the target proteins are mainly involved in virus process,
      transcription regulation, cell adhesion, and so on. In addition, the common and
      specific targets were identified and compared based on the networks between
      WNV-human and Dengue virus II (DENV2)-human. Finally, by combining topological
      features and existing drug target information, we identified 30 potential
      anti-WNV human targets, among which 11 ones were reported to be associated with
      WNV infection. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - Many time-series models for disease counts utilise information from environmental
      variables. We focus on weekly dengue fever (DF) incidence rates in Singapore and 
      demonstrate the strong negative correlation between an appropriately time-lagged 
      total weekly rainfall and DF incidence. A Bayesian neural network time-series
      model for predicting DF incidence which utilizes rainfall data is introduced. A
      comparison is made between this neural network model and a time-series model
      which does not use any covariate information. An easily implementable method for 
      choosing between the models which optimizes future prediction accuracy is
      suggested as well. We note that our proposed comparison method is applicable to
      any competing time-series models. This algorithm is demonstrated through examples
      of comparisons between pairs of different time-series models.

AB  - Aedes albopictus is a very important vector for pathogens of many infectious
      diseases including dengue fever. In this study, we explored the genetic
      polymorphism of Aedes albopictus strains in different geographical regions using 
      DNA barcoding of mitochondrial COI (MT-COI) gene. We collected MT-COI sequence of
      106 Aedes albopictus mosquitos from 6 provinces in China including Fujian,
      Guangdong, Hainan, Yunnan, and Taiwan. The length of the sequences is 709bp with 
      the content of A+T (67.7%) greater than that of G+C (32.3%). We identified
      mutations in 90 (13.68%) loci, of which 57 (63.33%) are transitions, 28 (31.11%) 
      are transversions, and 5 (5.56%) are hypervariable loci. In addition, we obtained
      42 haplotypes, 4 (9.52%) of which are shared among different populations. The
      haplotype diversity of Aedes albopictus is 0.882 and nucleotide diversity is
      0.01017. Moreover, the pedigree network diagram shows that most haplotypes are
      under parallel evolution, suggesting a local expansion of Aedes albopictus in
      history. Finally, the Neighbor-Joining tree of MT-COI haplotypes reveals a
      certain correlation between haplotype clusters and geographical distribution, and
      there are differences among Aedes albopictus in different geographical regions.
      In conclusion, DNA barcoding of MT-COI gene is an effective method to study the
      genetic structure of Aedes albopictus.

TI  - Accuracy of dengue clinical diagnosis with and without NS1 antigen rapid test:
      Comparison between human and Bayesian network model decision.
PG  - e0006573
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006573 [doi]
AB  - Differentiating dengue patients from other acute febrile illness patients is a
      great challenge among physicians. Several dengue diagnosis methods are
      recommended by WHO. The application of specific laboratory tests is still limited
      due to high cost, lack of equipment, and uncertain validity. Therefore, clinical 
      diagnosis remains a common practice especially in resource limited settings.
      Bayesian networks have been shown to be a useful tool for diagnostic decision
      support. This study aimed to construct Bayesian network models using basic
      demographic, clinical, and laboratory profiles of acute febrile illness patients 
      to diagnose dengue. Data of 397 acute undifferentiated febrile illness patients
      who visited the fever clinic of the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases,
      Thailand, were used for model construction and validation. The two best final
      models were selected: one with and one without NS1 rapid test result. The
      diagnostic accuracy of the models was compared with that of physicians on the
      same set of patients. The Bayesian network models provided good diagnostic
      accuracy of dengue infection, with ROC AUC of 0.80 and 0.75 for models with and
      without NS1 rapid test result, respectively. The models had approximately 80%
      specificity and 70% sensitivity, similar to the diagnostic accuracy of the
      hospital's fellows in infectious disease. Including information on NS1 rapid test
      improved the specificity, but reduced the sensitivity, both in model and
      physician diagnoses. The Bayesian network model developed in this study could be 
      useful to assist physicians in diagnosing dengue, particularly in regions where
      experienced physicians and laboratory confirmation tests are limited.

AB  - Viral infection causes many physiological alterations in the host cell, and many 
      of these alterations can affect the host mitochondrial network, including
      mitophagy induction. A substantial amount of literature has been generated that
      advances our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and several
      viruses. Some viruses trigger mitophagy directly, and indirectly and control the 
      mitophagic process via different strategies. This enables viruses to promote
      persistent infection and attenuate the innate immune responses. In this review,
      we discuss the events of virus-regulated mitophagy and the functional relevance
      of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of viral infection and disease. Abbreviation:

TI  - Dengue Infection Spectrum in Guangzhou: A Cross-Sectional Seroepidemiology Study 
      among Community Residents between 2013 and 2015.
LID - E1227 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph15061227 [doi]
AB  - The majority of dengue virus infections are asymptomatic, which could potentially
      facilitate the transmission of dengue fever and increase the percentage of sever 
      dengue fever manifestations. This cross-sectional study explored the
      sero-prevalence of dengue virus infection in Guangzhou to clarify the infection
      spectrum. In total, 2085 serum samples were collected from residents of 34
      communities. All samples were selected from a 200,000-sample database holding
      serum collected from community residents living in Liwan and Yuexiu districts of 
      Guangzhou between September 2013 and August 2015, and 17 to 28 individuals of
      each age group were chosen per month. Dengue immunoglobulin G (IgG) and
      immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay. Symptomatic infected individuals were identified via follow-up
      questionnaires. Among 2085 serum samples, anti-dengue IgG and IgM positive rates 
      were 11.80% and 3.98%, respectively. The IgG antibody positive rate increased
      with age and was higher in poorly educated people than in highly educated people 
      and in married individuals than in single individuals. Approximately 96.71% of
      dengue virus infections and an estimated 13.68% of the whole population were
      asymptomatic. Such high asymptomatic-infection rates have an impact on the local 
      spread of dengue fever. Stricter surveillance, such as a network of rapid
      diagnostic laboratories, screening of residents in the epidemic season, and other
      integrated control measures are necessary.

TI  - VEGF Upregulation in Viral Infections and Its Possible Therapeutic Implications.
LID - E1642 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms19061642 [doi]
AB  - Several viruses are recognized as the direct or indirect causative agents of
      human tumors and other severe human diseases. Vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (VEGF) is identified as a principal proangiogenic factor that enhances the
      production of new blood vessels from existing vascular network. Therefore,
      oncogenic viruses such as Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr
      virus (EBV) and non-oncogenic viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) and
      dengue virus, which lack their own angiogenic factors, rely on the recruitment of
      cellular genes for angiogenesis in tumor progression or disease pathogenesis.
      This review summarizes how human viruses exploit the cellular signaling machinery
      to upregulate the expression of VEGF and benefit from its physiological functions
      for their own pathogenesis. Understanding the interplay between viruses and VEGF 
      upregulation will pave the way to design targeted and effective therapeutic
      approaches for viral oncogenesis and severe diseases.

TI  - Acute Kidney Injury of Infectious Etiology in Monsoon Season: A Prospective Study
      Using Acute Kidney Injury Network Criteria.
PG  - 143-152
LID - 10.4103/ijn.IJN_355_16 [doi]
AB  - The epidemiological pattern of acute kidney injury (AKI) in tropical countries
      during monsoon reflects infectious disease as the most important cause. AKI is a 
      confounding factor and may be overlooked by primary health-care providers and
      underreported in health statistics. The present study prospectively helps
      estimate the burden of disease and analyze etiology, clinical profile, and
      outcome in a tertiary care hospital of a metropolitan city in a tropical country.
      The study period included monsoon season of 2012 and 2013, a total of 8 months.
      AKI staging was done as per the AKI Network (AKIN) criteria. Patients were
      treated for primary disease. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was given as
      required. Patients were followed up during hospitalization till recovery/death.
      Out of a total of 9930 admissions during this period, 1740 (17.52%) were for
      infections and 230 (2.31%) had AKI secondary to infectious diseases during
      monsoon. The incidence of AKI (230/1740) in infectious diseases during monsoon
      was 13.21%. The study population (n = 230) comprised 79.5% of males and the mean 
      age was 40.95 +/- 16.55 years. Severe AKI: AKIN Stage III was seen in 48.26% of
      patients and AKIN Stage I in 41.74%. The most common etiology of AKI was malaria 
      (28.3%) followed by acute gastroenteritis (23%), dengue (16.5%), leptospirosis
      (13%), undifferentiated fever (10.4%), more than one etiology (5.4%), and enteric
      fever (3.5%). RRT was required in 44.78% of patients. Requirement for RRT was
      maximum in patients with more than one etiology followed by leptospirosis,
      malaria, dengue, and least in typhoid. The overall mortality was 12.17%. In
      multivariate analysis, vasopressor support and assisted ventilation were risk
      factors for mortality.

AB  - Dengue is a widespread viral disease with 3.6 billion people at risk worldwide.
      Humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) 513, currently undergoing clinical trials in 
      Singapore, targets an epitope on the envelope protein domain III exposed at the
      surface of the viral particle. This antibody potently neutralizes all four dengue
      virus serotypes in a humanized mouse model that recapitulates human dengue
      infection, without signs of antibody-mediated enhancement of the disease. The
      crystal structure of single-chain variable fragment (scFv) 513 bound to the
      envelope protein domain III from dengue virus serotype 4 was used as a template
      to explore the molecular origins of the broader cross-reactivity and increased in
      vivo potency of mAb 513, compared to the parent murine mAb 4E11, using molecular 
      dynamics simulations and network analyses. These two methods are a powerful
      complement to existing structural and binding data and detail specific
      interactions that underpin the differential binding of the two antibodies. We
      found that a Glu at position H55 (Glu(H55)) from the second Complementarity
      Determining Region of the Heavy chain (CDR-H2) which corresponds to Ala in 4E11, 
      is a major contributor to the enhancement in the interactions of mAb 513 compared
      to 4E11. Importantly, we also validate the importance of Glu(H55) using
      site-directed mutagenesis followed by isothermal titration calorimetry
      measurements.

TI  - The AWED trial (Applying Wolbachia to Eliminate Dengue) to assess the efficacy of
      Wolbachia-infected mosquito deployments to reduce dengue incidence in Yogyakarta,
      Indonesia: study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 302
LID - 10.1186/s13063-018-2670-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue and other arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes,
      including Zika and chikungunya, present an increasing public health challenge in 
      tropical regions. Current vector control strategies have failed to curb disease
      transmission, but continue to be employed despite the absence of robust evidence 
      for their effectiveness or optimal implementation. The World Mosquito Program has
      developed a novel approach to arbovirus control using Ae. aegypti stably
      transfected with Wolbachia bacterium, with a significantly reduced ability to
      transmit dengue, Zika and chikungunya in laboratory experiments. Modelling
      predicts this will translate to local elimination of dengue in most
      epidemiological settings. This study protocol describes the first trial to
      measure the efficacy of Wolbachia in reducing dengue virus transmission in the
      field. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a parallel, two-arm, non-blinded cluster
      randomised controlled trial conducted in a single site in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. 
      The aim is to determine whether large-scale deployment of Wolbachia-infected Ae. 
      aegypti mosquitoes leads to a measurable reduction in dengue incidence in treated
      versus untreated areas. The primary endpoint is symptomatic, virologically
      confirmed dengue virus infection of any severity. The 26 km(2) study area was
      subdivided into 24 contiguous clusters, allocated randomly 1:1 to receive
      Wolbachia deployments or no intervention. We use a novel epidemiological study
      design, the cluster-randomised test-negative design trial, in which dengue cases 
      and arbovirus-negative controls are sampled concurrently from among febrile
      patients presenting to a network of primary care clinics, with case or control
      status classified retrospectively based on the results of laboratory diagnostic
      testing. Efficacy is estimated from the odds ratio of Wolbachia exposure
      distribution (probability of living in a Wolbachia-treated area) among
      virologically confirmed dengue cases compared to test-negative controls. A
      secondary per-protocol analysis allows for individual Wolbachia exposure levels
      to be assessed to account for movements outside the cluster and the heterogeneity
      in local Wolbachia prevalence among treated clusters. DISCUSSION: The findings
      from this study will provide the first experimental evidence for the efficacy of 
      Wolbachia in reducing dengue incidence. Together with observational evidence that
      is accumulating from pragmatic deployments of Wolbachia in other field sites,
      this will provide valuable data to estimate the effectiveness of this novel
      approach to arbovirus control, inform future cost-effectiveness estimates, and
      guide plans for large-scale deployments in other endemic settings. TRIAL

AB  - Viruses from the Flavivirus family are the causative agents of dengue fever,
      Zika, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis or Yellow fever and
      constitute major or emerging public health problems. A better understanding of
      the flavivirus replication cycle is likely to offer new opportunities for the
      design of antiviral therapies to treat severe conditions provoked by these
      viruses, but it should also help reveal fundamental biological mechanisms of the 
      host cell. During virus replication, RNA synthesis is mediated by a dynamic and
      membrane-bound multi-protein assembly, named the replication complex (RC). The RC
      is composed of both viral and host-cell proteins that assemble within vesicles
      composed of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, near the nucleus. At the heart of
      the flavivirus RC lies NS4B, a viral integral membrane protein that plays a role 
      in virulence and in down-regulating the innate immune response. NS4B binds to the
      NS2B-NS3 protease-helicase, which itself interacts with the NS5
      methyl-transferase polymerase. We present an overview of recent structural and
      functional data that augment our understanding of how viral RNA is replicated by 
      dengue virus. We focus on structural data that illuminate the various roles
      played by proteins NS2B-NS3, NS4B and NS5. By participating in viral RNA cap
      methylation, the NS5 methyltransferase enables the virus to escape the host cell 
      innate immune response. We present the molecular basis for this activity. We
      summarize what we know about the network of interactions established by NS2B-NS3,
      NS4B and NS5 (their "interactome"). This leads to a working model that is
      captured in the form of a rather naive "cartoon", which we hope will be refined
      towards an atomic model in the near future.

AB  - There is always a substantial effort to develop a point of care detection for a
      severe and acute disease like dengue. In this work, we have described the
      detection of serotype-specific dengue virus using multicolor triangular silver
      nanoparticles (TAg) which could be a potential diagnosis method to distinguish
      between serotype. Functionalized TAg was prepared with polyA10 DNA through
      pH-mediated process. Further, it was characterized with Transmission Electron
      Microscopy (TEM), Ultra Visible-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and gel
      electrophoresis and its stability towards NaCl concentration. The colorimetric
      detection was carried out based on the interaction of TAg-DNA probe with specific
      complimentary strand which was designed to form a network assembly between DNA
      probes and sample RNA. The hybridization process was enhanced in presence of NaCl
      (0.4M) which makes the hybridization process more stable over probe compared to
      un-hybridization. Therefore a simple and effective colorimetric method was
      developed to detect the different dengue serotype RNA with high sensitivity and
      specificity.

TI  - Data quality and timeliness of outbreak reporting system among countries in
      Greater Mekong subregion: Challenges for international data sharing.

AB  - Cross-border disease transmission is a key challenge for prevention and control
      of outbreaks. Variation in surveillance structure and national guidelines used in
      different countries can affect their data quality and the timeliness of outbreak 
      reports. This study aimed to evaluate timeliness and data quality of national
      outbreak reporting for four countries in the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance
      network (MBDS). Data on disease outbreaks occurring from 2010 to 2015 were
      obtained from the national disease surveillance reports of Cambodia, Lao PDR,
      Myanmar, and Vietnam. Data included total cases, geographical information, and
      dates at different timeline milestones in the outbreak detection process. Nine
      diseases or syndromes with public health importance were selected for the
      analysis including: dengue, food poisoning & diarrhea, severe diarrhea,
      diphtheria, measles, H5N1 influenza, H1N1 influenza, rabies, and pertussis.
      Overall, 2,087 outbreaks were reported from the four countries. The number of
      outbreaks and number of cases per outbreak varied across countries and diseases, 
      depending in part on the outbreak definition used in each country. Dates on index
      onset, report, and response were >95% complete in all countries, while laboratory
      confirmation dates were 10%-100% incomplete in most countries. Inconsistent and
      out of range date data were observed in 1%-5% of records. The overall timeliness 
      of outbreak report, response, and public communication was within 1-15 days,
      depending on countries and diseases. Diarrhea and severe diarrhea outbreaks
      showed the most rapid time to report and response, whereas diseases such as
      rabies, pertussis and diphtheria required a longer time to report and respond.
      The hierarchical structure of the reporting system, data collection method, and
      country's resources could affect the data quality and timeliness of the national 
      outbreak reporting system. Differences in data quality and timeliness of outbreak
      reporting system among member countries should be considered when planning data
      sharing strategies within a regional network.

      Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 68
LID - 10.1038/s41426-018-0069-2 [doi]
AB  - Understanding Zika virus infection dynamics is essential, as its recent emergence
      revealed possible devastating neuropathologies in humans, thus causing a major
      threat to public health worldwide. Recent research allowed breakthrough in our
      understanding of the virus and host pathogenesis; however, little is known on its
      impact on its main vector, Aedes aegypti. Here we show how Zika virus targets
      Aedes aegypti's neurons and induces changes in its behavior. Results are compared
      to dengue virus, another flavivirus, which triggers a different pattern of
      behavioral changes. We used microelectrode array technology to record electrical 
      spiking activity of mosquito primary neurons post infections and discovered that 
      only Zika virus causes an increase in spiking activity of the neuronal network.
      Confocal microscopy also revealed an increase in synapse connections for Zika
      virus-infected neuronal networks. Interestingly, the results also showed that
      mosquito responds to infection by overexpressing glutamate regulatory genes while
      maintaining virus levels. This neuro-excitation, possibly via glutamate, could
      contribute to the observed behavioral changes in Zika virus-infected Aedes
      aegypti females. This study reveals the importance of virus-vector interaction in
      arbovirus neurotropism, in humans and vector. However, it appears that the
      consequences differ in the two hosts, with neuropathology in human host, while
      behavioral changes in the mosquito vector that may be advantageous to the virus.

TI  - Detection of the Invasive Mosquito Species Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Diptera:
      Culicidae) in Portugal.
LID - E820 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph15040820 [doi]
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is an invasive mosquito originating
      from the Asia-Pacific region. This species is of major concern to public and
      veterinary health because of its vector role in the transmission of several
      pathogens, such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses. In Portugal, a National
      Vector Surveillance Network (REde de VIgil&acirc;ncia de VEctores&mdash;REVIVE)
      is responsible for the surveillance of autochthonous, but also invasive, mosquito
      species at points of entry, such as airports, ports, storage areas, and specific 
      border regions with Spain. At these locations, networks of mosquito traps are set
      and maintained under surveillance throughout the year. In September 2017, Ae.
      albopictus was detected for the first time in a tyre company located in the North
      of Portugal. Molecular typing was performed, and a preliminary phylogenetic
      analysis indicated a high similarity with sequences of Ae. albopictus collected
      in Europe. A prompt surveillance response was locally implemented to determine
      its dispersal and abundance, and adult mosquitoes were screened for the presence 
      of arboviral RNA. A total of 103 specimens, 52 immatures and 51 adults, were
      collected. No pathogenic viruses were detected. Despite the obtained results
      suggest low abundance of the population locally introduced, the risk of dispersal
      and potential establishment of Ae. albopictus in Portugal has raised concern for 
      autochthonous mosquito-borne disease outbreaks.

TI  - Allostery in the dengue virus NS3 helicase: Insights into the NTPase cycle from
      molecular simulations.
PG  - e1006103
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006103 [doi]
AB  - The C-terminus domain of non-structural 3 (NS3) protein of the Flaviviridae
      viruses (e.g. HCV, dengue, West Nile, Zika) is a nucleotide triphosphatase
      (NTPase) -dependent superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase that unwinds double-stranded RNA
      while translocating along the nucleic polymer. Due to these functions, NS3 is an 
      important target for antiviral development yet the biophysics of this enzyme are 
      poorly understood. Microsecond-long molecular dynamic simulations of the dengue
      NS3 helicase domain are reported from which allosteric effects of RNA and NTPase 
      substrates are observed. The presence of a bound single-stranded RNA
      catalytically enhances the phosphate hydrolysis reaction by affecting the
      dynamics and positioning of waters within the hydrolysis active site. Coupled
      with results from the simulations, electronic structure calculations of the
      reaction are used to quantify this enhancement to be a 150-fold increase, in
      qualitative agreement with the experimental enhancement factor of 10-100.
      Additionally, protein-RNA interactions exhibit NTPase substrate-induced
      allostery, where the presence of a nucleotide (e.g. ATP or ADP) structurally
      perturbs residues in direct contact with the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA. 
      Residue-residue network analyses highlight pathways of short ranged interactions 
      that connect the two active sites. These analyses identify motif V as a highly
      connected region of protein structure through which energy released from either
      active site is hypothesized to move, thereby inducing the observed allosteric
      effects. These results lay the foundation for the design of novel allosteric
      inhibitors of NS3.

      strategy using short message service data transmission in two southern regions of
      Madagascar, 2014-15.
PG  - 265

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was 
      introduced in Madagascar in 2007. Information was collected by Healthcare
      structures (HS) on paper forms and transferred to the central level by post or
      email. Completeness of data reporting was around 20% in 2009-10. From 2011, in
      two southern regions data were transmitted through short messages service using
      one telephone provider. We evaluated the system in 2014-15 to determine its
      performance before changing or expanding it. METHODS: We randomly selected 80 HS 
      and interviewed their representatives face-to-face (42) or by telephone (38). We 
      evaluated knowledge of surveillance activities and selected case definitions,
      number of SMS with erroneous or missing information among the last ten
      transferred SMS, proportion of weekly reports received in the last 4 weeks and of
      the last four health alerts notified within 48 h, as well as mobile phone network
      coverage. RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of 80 interviewed HS representatives didn't
      know their terms of reference, 83% were familiar with the malaria case definition
      and 32% with that of dengue. Ninety percent (37/41) of visited HS had five or
      more errors and 47% had missing data in the last ten SMS they transferred. The
      average time needed for weekly IDSR data compilation was 24 min in the Southern
      and 47 in the South-eastern region. Of 320 expected SMS 232 (73%) were received, 
      136 (43%) of them in time. Out of 38 alerts detected, four were notified on time.
      Nine percent (7/80) of HS had no telephone network with the current provider.
      CONCLUSIONS: SMS transfer has improved IDSR data completeness, but timeliness and
      data quality remain a problem. Healthcare staff needs training on guidelines and 
      case definitions. From 2016, data are collected and managed electronically to
      reduce errors and improve the system's performance.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the important factors leading to the spread of dengue
      fever. Recently, some studies found that the road network as an urbanization
      factor affects the distribution and spread of dengue epidemic, but the study of
      relationship between the distribution of dengue epidemic and road network is
      limited, especially in highly urbanized areas. This study explores the temporal
      and spatial spread characteristics of dengue fever in the distribution of road
      network by observing a dengue epidemic in the southern Chinese cities. Geographic
      information technology is used to extract the spatial location of cases and
      explore the temporal and spatial changes of dengue epidemic and its spatial
      relationship with road network. The results showed that there was a significant
      "severe" period in the temporal change of dengue epidemic situation, and the
      cases were mainly concentrated in the vicinity of narrow roads, the spread of the
      epidemic mainly along the high-density road network area. These results show that
      high-density road network is an important factor to the direction and scale of
      dengue epidemic. This information may be helpful to the development of related
      epidemic prevention and control strategies.

TI  - Dynamics of Zika virus outbreaks: an overview of mathematical modeling
      approaches.
PG  - e4526
LID - 10.7717/peerj.4526 [doi]
AB  - Background: The Zika virus was first discovered in 1947. It was neglected until a
      major outbreak occurred on Yap Island, Micronesia, in 2007. Teratogenic effects
      resulting in microcephaly in newborn infants is the greatest public health
      threat. In 2016, the Zika virus epidemic was declared as a Public Health
      Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Consequently, mathematical models
      were constructed to explicitly elucidate related transmission dynamics. Survey
      Methodology: In this review article, two steps of journal article searching were 
      performed. First, we attempted to identify mathematical models previously applied
      to the study of vector-borne diseases using the search terms "dynamics,"
      "mathematical model," "modeling," and "vector-borne" together with the names of
      vector-borne diseases including chikungunya, dengue, malaria, West Nile, and
      Zika. Then the identified types of model were further investigated. Second, we
      narrowed down our survey to focus on only Zika virus research. The terms we
      searched for were "compartmental," "spatial," "metapopulation," "network,"
      "individual-based," "agent-based" AND "Zika." All relevant studies were included 
      regardless of the year of publication. We have collected research articles that
      were published before August 2017 based on our search criteria. In this
      publication survey, we explored the Google Scholar and PubMed databases. Results:
      We found five basic model architectures previously applied to vector-borne virus 
      studies, particularly in Zika virus simulations. These include compartmental,
      spatial, metapopulation, network, and individual-based models. We found that Zika
      models carried out for early epidemics were mostly fit into compartmental
      structures and were less complicated compared to the more recent ones. Simple
      models are still commonly used for the timely assessment of epidemics.
      Nevertheless, due to the availability of large-scale real-world data and
      computational power, recently there has been growing interest in more complex
      modeling frameworks. Discussion: Mathematical models are employed to explore and 
      predict how an infectious disease spreads in the real world, evaluate the disease
      importation risk, and assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies. As the
      trends in modeling of infectious diseases have been shifting towards data-driven 
      approaches, simple and complex models should be exploited differently. Simple
      models can be produced in a timely fashion to provide an estimation of the
      possible impacts. In contrast, complex models integrating real-world data require
      more time to develop but are far more realistic. The preparation of complicated
      modeling frameworks prior to the outbreaks is recommended, including the case of 
      future Zika epidemic preparation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The analysis of modular gene co-expression networks is a
      well-established method commonly used for discovering the systems-level
      functionality of genes. In addition, these studies provide a basis for the
      discovery of clinically relevant molecular pathways underlying different diseases
      and conditions. RESULTS: In this paper, we present a fast and easy-to-use
      Bioconductor package named CEMiTool that unifies the discovery and the analysis
      of co-expression modules. Using the same real datasets, we demonstrate that
      CEMiTool outperforms existing tools, and provides unique results in a
      user-friendly html report with high quality graphs. Among its features, our tool 
      evaluates whether modules contain genes that are over-represented by specific
      pathways or that are altered in a specific sample group, as well as it integrates
      transcriptomic data with interactome information, identifying the potential hubs 
      on each network. We successfully applied CEMiTool to over 1000 transcriptome
      datasets, and to a new RNA-seq dataset of patients infected with Leishmania,
      revealing novel insights of the disease's physiopathology. CONCLUSION: The
      CEMiTool R package provides users with an easy-to-use method to automatically
      implement gene co-expression network analyses, obtain key information about the
      discovered gene modules using additional downstream analyses and retrieve
      publication-ready results via a high-quality interactive report.

AB  - Infection with dengue virus (DENV) can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical
      presentations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to death. It is estimated that
      the disease manifests only in 90 million cases out of the total 390 million
      yearly infections. Even though research has not yet elucidated which are the
      precise pathophysiological mechanisms that trigger severe forms of dengue, the
      infection elicits a critical immune response significant for dengue pathogenesis 
      development. Understanding how the immune response to DENV is established and how
      it can resolve the infection or turn into an immunopathology is of great
      importance in DENV research. Currently, studies have extensively debated 2
      hypotheses involving immune response: antibody-dependent enhancement and cytokine
      storm. However, despite its undeniable importance in severe forms of the disease,
      these 2 hypotheses are based on a primed immune status resulting from previous
      heterologous infection, abstaining them from explaining the severe forms of
      dengue in naive immune subjects, for example. Thus, it seems that a more
      intricate arrangement of causes and conditions must be achieved to severe dengue 
      to occur. Among them, the cytokine network signature elicited, in association
      with viral aspects deserves special attention regarding the establishment of
      infection and evolution to pathogenesis. In this work, we intend to shed light on
      how those elements contribute to severe dengue development.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of dengue viruses in three provinces of Lao PDR,
      2006-2010.
PG  - e0006203

AB  - Few data on dengue epidemiology are available for Lao PDR. Here, we provide
      information on the complexity of dengue epidemiology in the country,
      demonstrating dynamic circulation that varies over space and time, according to
      serotype. We recruited 1,912 consenting patients presenting with WHO dengue
      criteria at Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane (central Laos), between 2006 and 2010.
      Between 2008 and 2010, 1,413 patients with undifferentiated fever were also
      recruited at Luang Namtha (LNT) Provincial Hospital (northern Laos) and 555 at
      Salavan (SV) Provincial Hospital (southern Laos). We report significant
      variations in Dengue virus (DENV) circulation between the three sites. Peaks of
      DENV infection were observed in the rainy seasons, although 11% of confirmed
      cases in the provinces and 4.6% in the capital were detected during the dry and
      cool seasons (between December and February). Four DENV serotypes were detected
      among the 867 RT-PCR positive patients: 76.9% DENV-1, 9.6% DENV-2, 7.7% DENV-4
      and 5.3% DENV-3. DENV-1 was the predominant serotype throughout the study except 
      in LNT in 2008 and 2009 when it was DENV-2. Before July 2009, DENV-2 was not
      detected in SV and only rarely detected in Vientiane. DENV-3 and DENV-4 were
      commonly detected in Vientiane, before 2008 for DENV-4 and after 2009 for DENV-3.
      The phylogenetic analyses of DENV envelope sequences suggest concurrent multiple 
      introductions of new strains as well as active DENV circulation throughout Laos
      and with neighboring countries. It is therefore of great importance to develop
      and strengthen a year-round nation-wide surveillance network in order to collect 
      data that would allow anticipation of public health issues caused by the
      occurrence of large dengue outbreaks.

TI  - Patterns of Urban Housing Shape Dengue Distribution in Singapore at Neighborhood 
      and Country Scales.
PG  - 54-67
LID - 10.1002/2017GH000080 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is the most important human arboviral disease in Singapore. We classified 
      residential areas into low-rise and high-rise housing and investigated the
      influence of urban drainage on the distribution of dengue incidence and outdoor
      breeding at neighborhood and country scales. In Geylang area (August 2014 to
      August 2015), dengue incidence was higher in a subarea of low-rise housing
      compared to high-rise one, averaging 26.7 (standard error, SE = 4.83) versus 2.43
      (SE = 0.67) per 1,000 people. Outdoor breeding drains of Aedes aegypti have
      clustered in the low-rise housing subarea. The pupal density per population was
      higher in the low-rise blocks versus high-rise ones, 246 (SE = 69.08) and 35.4
      (SE = 25.49) per 1,000 people, respectively. The density of urban drainage
      network in the low-rise blocks is double that in the high-rise ones, averaging
      0.05 (SE = 0.0032) versus 0.025 (SE = 0.00245) per meter. Further, a holistic
      analysis at a country-scale has confirmed the role of urban hydrology in shaping 
      dengue distribution in Singapore. Dengue incidence (2013-2015) is proportional to
      the fractions of the area (or population) of low-rise housing. The drainage
      density in low-rise housing is 4 times that corresponding estimate in high-rise
      areas, 2.59 and 0.68 per meter, respectively. Public housing in agglomerations of
      high-rise buildings could have a positive impact on dengue if this urban planning
      comes at the expense of low-rise housing. City planners in endemic regions should
      consider the density of drainage networks for both the prevention of flooding and
      the breeding of mosquitoes.

      associated with induction of both a long-lived protective immune response and
      immune-suppression. So far, the potency of treatment of DENV via antiviral drugs 
      is still under investigation. Recently, increasing evidences suggest the
      potential role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating DENV. The present study
      focused on the function of miRNAs in innate insusceptible reactions and
      organization of various types of immune cells and inflammatory responses for
      DENV. Three drugs were tested including antiviral herbal medicine ReDuNing (RDN),
      Loratadine (LRD) and Acetaminophen. RESULTS: By the microarray expression of
      miRNAs in 165 Patients. Results showed that 89 active miRNAs interacted with 499 
      potential target genes, during antiviral treatment throughout the critical stage 
      of DENV. Interestingly, reduction of the illness threats using RDN combined with 
      LRD treatment showed better results than Acetaminophen alone. The inhibitions of 
      DENV was confirmed by decrease concentrations of cytokines and interleukin
      parameters; like TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-17;
      after treatment and some coagulants factors increased. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      showed a preliminary support to suggest that the herbal medicine RDN combined
      with LRD can reduce both susceptibility and the severity of DENV.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infections cause the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral
      disease worldwide, for which no therapies are available. DENV encodes seven
      non-structural (NS) proteins that co-assemble and recruit poorly characterized
      host factors to form the DENV replication complex essential for viral infection. 
      Here, we provide a global proteomic analysis of the human host factors that
      interact with the DENV NS1 protein. Combined with a functional RNAi screen, this 
      study reveals a comprehensive network of host cellular processes involved in DENV
      infection and identifies DENV host restriction and dependency factors. We
      highlight an important role of RACK1 and the chaperonin TRiC (CCT) and
      oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complexes during DENV replication. We further
      show that the OST complex mediates NS1 and NS4B glycosylation, and
      pharmacological inhibition of its N-glycosylation function strongly impairs DENV 
      infection. In conclusion, our study provides a global interactome of the DENV NS1
      and identifies host factors targetable for antiviral therapies.

AB  - Dengue transmission is a complex spatiotemporal process with hidden interactions 
      between hosts, vectors, and viruses as well as environment. This study aims to
      identify the transmission patterns and the driving mechanism that contributed to 
      the dengue epidemics occurred in Guangdong Province of China in 2014. Based on
      the city-specific epidemiological, meteorological, demographic and geographic
      data, we first performed wavelet analysis and then integrated the key dynamics
      (i.e., mosquito population dynamics, human movement, virus transmission, and
      parameter estimation) into a transmission model. Using these methods, we found a 
      clear temporal sequence and correlation of dengue transmission between cities,
      and such relationship is associated with socioeconomic factors. We further
      obtained the specific component of dengue incidence data in each city, and
      presented the underlying infectivity networks for characterizing how dengue
      transmits from one location to another. The results showed that the communication
      of in-out infections with Guangzhou and Foshan could be responsible for the
      large-scale diffusion of dengue epidemics in Guangdong in 2014. Our findings can 
      offer new insights into how to improve the predictability and risk assessment of 
      dengue transmission.

TI  - Broad-spectrum antiviral agents: secreted phospholipase A2 targets viral envelope
      lipid bilayers derived from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
PG  - 15931
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-16130-w [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV) and Japanese encephalitis virus
      (JEV) belong to the family Flaviviridae. Their viral particles have the envelope 
      composed of viral proteins and a lipid bilayer acquired from budding through the 
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The phospholipid content of the ER membrane differs
      from that of the plasma membrane (PM). The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) superfamily
      consists of a large number of members that specifically catalyse the hydrolysis
      of phospholipids at a particular position. Here we show that the CM-II isoform of
      secreted PLA2 obtained from Naja mossambica mossambica snake venom (CM-II-sPLA2) 
      possesses potent virucidal (neutralising) activity against HCV, DENV and JEV,
      with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 0.036, 0.31 and 1.34 ng/ml,
      respectively. In contrast, the IC50 values of CM-II-sPLA2 against viruses that
      bud through the PM (Sindbis virus, influenza virus and Sendai virus) or
      trans-Golgi network (TGN) (herpes simplex virus) were >10,000 ng/ml. Moreover,
      the 50% cytotoxic (CC50) and haemolytic (HC50) concentrations of CM-II-sPLA2 were
      >10,000 ng/ml, implying that CM-II-sPLA2 did not significantly damage the PM.
      These results suggest that CM-II-sPLA2 and its derivatives are good candidates
      for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that target viral envelope 
      lipid bilayers derived from the ER membrane.

TI  - A network model for control of dengue epidemic using sterile insect technique.
PG  - 441-460
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2018020 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, a network model has been proposed to control dengue disease
      transmission considering host-vector dynamics in n patches. The control of
      mosquitoes is performed by SIT. In SIT, the male insects are sterilized in the
      laboratory and released into the environment to control the number of offsprings.
      The basic reproduction number has been computed. The existence and stability of
      various states have been discussed. The bifurcation diagram has been plotted to
      show the existence and stability regions of disease-free and endemic states for
      an isolated patch. The critical level of sterile male mosquitoes has been
      obtained for the control of disease. The basic reproduction number for n patch
      network model has been computed. It is evident from numerical simulations that
      SIT control in one patch may control the disease in the network having two/three 
      patches with suitable coupling among them.

TI  - The introduction of dengue follows transportation infrastructure changes in the
      state of Acre, Brazil: A network-based analysis.
PG  - e0006070
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006070 [doi]
AB  - Human mobility, presence and passive transportation of Aedes aegypti mosquito,
      and environmental characteristics are a group of factors which contribute to the 
      success of dengue spread and establishment. To understand this process, we assess
      data from dengue national and municipal basins regarding population and
      demographics, transportation network, human mobility, and Ae. aegypti monitoring 
      for the Brazilian state of Acre since the first recorded dengue case in the year 
      2000 to the year 2015. During this period, several changes in Acre's transport
      infrastructure and urbanization have been started. To reconstruct the process of 
      dengue introduction in Acre, we propose an analytic framework based on concepts
      used in malaria literature, namely vulnerability and receptivity, to inform risk 
      assessments in dengue-free regions as well as network theory concepts for disease
      invasion and propagation. We calculate the probability of dengue importation to
      Acre from other Brazilian states, the evolution of dengue spread between Acrean
      municipalities and dengue establishment in the state. Our findings suggest that
      the landscape changes associated with human mobility have created favorable
      conditions for the establishment of dengue virus transmission in Acre. The
      revitalization of its major roads, as well as the increased accessibility by air 
      to and within the state, have increased dengue vulnerability. Unplanned
      urbanization and population growth, as observed in Acre during the period of
      study, contribute to ideal conditions for Ae. aegypti mosquito establishment,
      increase the difficulty in mosquito control and consequently its local
      receptivity.

TI  - Rapid, directed transport of DC-SIGN clusters in the plasma membrane.
PG  - eaao1616
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.aao1616 [doi]
AB  - C-type lectins, including dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion
      molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), are all-purpose pathogen receptors
      that exist in nanoclusters in plasma membranes of dendritic cells. A small
      fraction of these clusters, obvious from the videos, can undergo rapid, directed 
      transport in the plane of the plasma membrane at average speeds of more than 1
      mum/s in both dendritic cells and MX DC-SIGN murine fibroblasts ectopically
      expressing DC-SIGN. Surprisingly, instantaneous speeds can be considerably
      greater. In MX DC-SIGN cells, many cluster trajectories are colinear with
      microtubules that reside close to the ventral membrane, and the
      microtubule-depolymerizing drug, nocodazole, markedly reduced the areal density
      of directed movement trajectories, suggesting a microtubule motor-driven
      transport mechanism; by contrast, latrunculin A, which affects the actin network,
      did not depress this movement. Rapid, retrograde movement of DC-SIGN may be an
      efficient mechanism for bringing bound pathogen on the leading edge and
      projections of dendritic cells to the perinuclear region for internalization and 
      processing. Dengue virus bound to DC-SIGN on dendritic projections was rapidly
      transported toward the cell center. The existence of this movement within the
      plasma membrane points to an unexpected lateral transport mechanism in mammalian 
      cells and challenges our current concepts of cortex-membrane interactions.

AB  - Since 2000, scientists and students from the greater Rocky Mountain region, along
      with invited speakers, both national and international, have gathered at the
      Mountain Campus of Colorado State University to discuss their area of study,
      present recent findings, establish or strengthen collaborations, and mentor the
      next generation of virologists and prionologists through formal presentations and
      informal discussions concerning science, grantsmanship and network development.
      This year, approximately 100 people attended the 17th annual Rocky Mountain
      Virology Association meeting, that began with a keynote presentation, and
      featured 29 oral and 35 poster presentations covering RNA and DNA viruses,
      prions, virus-host interactions and guides to successful mentorship. Since the
      keynote address focused on the structure and function of Zika and related
      flaviviruses, a special session was held to discuss RNA control. The secluded
      meeting at the foot of the Colorado Rocky Mountains gave ample time for in-depth 
      discussions amid the peak of fall colors in the aspen groves while the random
      bear provided excitement. On behalf of the Rocky Mountain Virology Association,
      this report summarizes the >50 reports.

AB  - Dengue infection is a public health problem with a complex distribution. The
      physical means of propagation and the dynamics of diffusion of the disease
      between municipalities need to be analysed to direct efficient public policies to
      prevent dengue infection. The present study presents correlations of occurrences 
      of reported cases of dengue infection among municipalities, self-organized
      criticality (SOC), and transportation between areas, identifying the
      municipalities that play an important role in the diffusion of dengue across the 
      state of Bahia, Brazil. The significant correlation found between the correlation
      network and the SOC demonstrates that the pattern of intramunicipal diffusion of 
      dengue is coupled to the pattern of synchronisation between the municipalities.
      Transportation emerges as influential in the dynamics of diffusion of epidemics
      by acting on the aforementioned variables.

AB  - The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) of the World Health Organization (WHO)
      continues to be a hotspot for emerging and reemerging infectious diseases and the
      need to prevent, detect, and respond to any infectious diseases that pose a
      threat to global health security remains a priority. Many risk factors contribute
      in the emergence and rapid spread of epidemic diseases in the Region including
      acute and protracted humanitarian emergencies, resulting in fragile health
      systems, increased population mobility, rapid urbanization, climate change, weak 
      surveillance and limited laboratory diagnostic capacity, and increased
      human-animal interaction. In EMR, several infectious disease outbreaks were
      detected, investigated, and rapidly contained over the past 5 years including:
      yellow fever in Sudan, Middle East respiratory syndrome in Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, 
      Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen, cholera in Iraq, avian influenza A
      (H5N1) infection in Egypt, and dengue fever in Yemen, Sudan, and Pakistan. Dengue
      fever remains an important public health concern, with at least eight countries
      in the region being endemic for the disease. The emergence of MERS-CoV in the
      region in 2012 and its continued transmission currently poses one of the greatest
      threats. In response to the growing frequency, duration, and scale of disease
      outbreaks, WHO has worked closely with member states in the areas of improving
      public health preparedness, surveillance systems, outbreak response, and
      addressing critical knowledge gaps. A Regional network for experts and technical 
      institutions has been established to facilitate support for international
      outbreak response. Major challenges are faced as a result of protracted
      humanitarian crises in the region. Funding gaps, lack of integrated approaches,
      weak surveillance systems, and absence of comprehensive response plans are other 
      areas of concern. Accelerated efforts are needed by Regional countries, with the 
      continuous support of WHO, to build and maintain a resilient public health system
      for detection and response to all acute public health events.

TI  - First record of the invasive mosquito species Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus
      (Diptera: Culicidae) on the southernmost Mediterranean islands of Italy and
      Europe.
PG  - 543
LID - 10.1186/s13071-017-2488-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes albopictus, a known worldwide vector of several mosquito-borne 
      disease pathogens including dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses, was introduced 
      into Europe in the late 1970s through global trade. First recorded in northern
      Italy in 1990, this mosquito species has rapidly spread throughout the country,
      where it was responsible for an outbreak of chikungunya in 2007 that affected
      more than 200 people. As part of the VectorNet project, which is aimed at
      improving preparedness and responsiveness for animal and human vector-borne
      diseases in Europe, a mosquito targeted study was carried out on the three
      southernmost Italian islands. The objective was to verify the current European
      southern distribution limits of Ae. albopictus and the potential occurrence of
      other invasive mosquito species, in the light of the introduction of high risk
      for vector-borne disease pathogens into Europe via migration flows. RESULTS: In
      the summer 2015, six surveys for container-breeding mosquitoes were carried out
      by setting up a network of oviposition traps and BG Sentinel traps in selected
      areas on the islands of Pantelleria, Lampedusa and Linosa. Aedes albopictus was
      found on all three islands under investigation. The consequences on public health
      with regard to the presence of this mosquito vector and the migrant people
      entering the country from Africa and the Middle East are also discussed here.
      CONCLUSIONS: The detection of the Asian tiger mosquito on these islands, which
      represent the last European strip of land facing Africa, has important
      implications for public health policy and should prompt the national authorities 
      to implement tailored surveillance activities and reinforce plans for
      preparedness strategies in such contexts.

TI  - New insights into flavivirus biology: the influence of pH over interactions
      between prM and E proteins.
PG  - 1009-1019
LID - 10.1007/s10822-017-0076-8 [doi]
AB  - Diseases caused by flaviviruses, such as dengue and zika, are globally recognized
      as major threats. During infection, a critical point in their replicative cycle
      is the maturation step, which occurs throughout the cellular exocytic pathway.
      This step is a pH-dependent process that involves the modification of the viral
      envelope by converting prM (pre-membrane) into M (membrane) proteins with the
      release of a "pr peptide". After this reaction, the pr peptides remain bound to
      the viral envelope while the virions cross the acidic trans-Golgi network, and
      are released only at neutral pH after secretion of the virus particles. Despite
      this current knowledge, the molecular basis of the flavivirus maturation step is 
      largely unknown. Here, based on the crystal structure of the dengue pr-E complex 
      ("pr peptide" bound to virus envelope protein) and using molecular dynamics
      simulations, we found that the pH shift from acidic to neutral yields
      considerable structural changes in the system. Dynamic cross correlation maps and
      root mean square deviation analyses revealed that the pr-E junction is clearly
      unstable under neutral pH. Secondary structure analysis also revealed that the
      fusion loop region, present in the E protein, is sensitive to pH and tends to
      unstructure at a neutral environment. Moreover, we found that five residues
      present in the E protein, Gly(102), His(244), Thr(70), Thr(68) and Asn(67) are
      critical to confer stability to the pr-E complex while inside the Golgi
      apparatus. This work brings details about the dynamical behavior of the pr-E
      system, helps to better understand the flavivirus biology and may also be of use 
      in the development of novel antiviral strategies.

AB  - Respiratory and arthropod-borne viral infections are a global threat due to the
      lack of effective antivirals and vaccines. A potential strategy is to target host
      proteins required for viruses but non-essential for the host. To identify such
      proteins, we performed a genome-wide knockout screen in human haploid cells and
      identified the calcium pump SPCA1. SPCA1 is required by viruses from the
      Paramyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, and Togaviridae families, including measles,
      dengue, West Nile, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. Calcium transport activity is
      required for SPCA1 to promote virus spread. SPCA1 regulates proteases within the 
      trans-Golgi network that require calcium for their activity and are critical for 
      virus glycoprotein maturation. Consistent with these findings, viral
      glycoproteins fail to mature in SPCA1-deficient cells preventing viral spread,
      which is evident even in cells with partial loss of SPCA1. Thus, SPCA1 is an
      attractive antiviral host target for a broad spectrum of established and emerging
      viral infections.

AB  - The function of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in liver injury resulted by dengue 
      virus (DENV) infection have not yet been explored. The differential expression
      profiles of lncRNAs (as well as mRNAs) in the L-02 liver cells infected by DENV1,
      DENV2, or uninfected were compared and analyzed after a high throughput RNA seq. 
      The significantly up-regulated and down-regulated lncRNAs (or mRNAs) resulted by 
      DENV infection were identified with a cutoff value at log2 (ratio) >/= 1.5 and
      log2 (ratio) </= -1.5 (ratio = the reads of the lncRNAs or mRNAs from the
      infection groups divided by the reads from the control group). Several
      differentially expressed lncRNAs were verified with reverse transcription
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Target gene analysis,
      pre-miRNA prediction, and the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network construction were
      performed to predict the function of the differentially expressed lncRNAs. The
      differentially expressed lncRNAs were associated with biosynthesis, DNA/RNA
      related processes, inhibition of estrogen signaling pathway, sterol biosynthetic 
      process, protein dimerization activity, vesicular fraction in DENV1 infection
      group; and with protein secretion, methyltransferase process, host cell
      cytoskeleton reorganization and the small GTPase Ras superfamily, inhibition of
      cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis in DENV2 infection. LncRNAs might be
      novel diagnostic markers and targets for further researches on dengue infection
      and liver injury resulted by dengue virus.

TI  - The Genetic Diversity, Haplotype Analysis, and Phylogenetic Relationship of Aedes
      albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) Based on the Cytochrome Oxidase 1 Marker: A
      Malaysian Scenario.
PG  - 1573-1581
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjx126 [doi]
AB  - The global expansion of Ae. albopictus from its native range in Southeast Asia
      has been implicated in the recent emergence of dengue endemicity in Malaysia.
      Genetic variability studies of Ae. albopictus are currently lacking in the
      Malaysian setting, yet are crucial to enhancing the existing vector control
      strategies. The study was conducted to establish the genetic variability of
      maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA encoding for cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 
      (CO1) gene in Ae. albopictus. Twelve localities were selected in the Subang Jaya 
      district based on temporal indices utilizing 120 mosquito samples. Genetic
      polymorphism and phylogenetic analysis were conducted to unveil the genetic
      variability and geographic origins of Ae. albopictus. The haplotype network was
      mapped to determine the genealogical relationship of sequences among groups of
      population in the Asian region. Comparison of Malaysian CO1 sequences with
      sequences derived from five Asian countries revealed genetically distinct Ae.
      albopictus populations. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all sequences from
      other Asian countries descended from the same genetic lineage as the Malaysian
      sequences. Noteworthy, our study highlights the discovery of 20 novel haplotypes 
      within the Malaysian population which to date had not been reported. These
      findings could help determine the genetic variation of this invasive species,
      which in turn could possibly improve the current dengue vector surveillance
      strategies, locally and regionally.

TI  - CD-loop Extension in Zika Virus Envelope Protein Key for Stability and
      Pathogenesis.
PG  - 1196-1204
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jix473 [doi]
AB  - With severe disease manifestations including microcephaly, congenital
      malformation, and Guillain-Barre syndrome, Zika virus (ZIKV) remains a persistent
      global public health threat. Despite antigenic similarities with dengue viruses, 
      structural studies have suggested the extended CD-loop and hydrogen-bonding
      interaction network within the ZIKV envelope protein contribute to stability
      differences between the viral families. This enhanced stability may lead to the
      augmented infection, disease manifestation, and persistence in body fluids seen
      following ZIKV infection. To examine the role of these motifs in infection, we
      generated a series of ZIKV recombinant viruses that disrupted the
      hydrogen-bonding network (350A, 351A, and 350A/351A) or the CD-loop extension
      (Delta346). Our results demonstrate a key role for the ZIKV extended CD-loop in
      cell-type-dependent replication, virion stability, and in vivo pathogenesis.
      Importantly, the Delta346 mutant maintains similar antigenicity to wild-type
      virus, opening the possibility for its use as a live-attenuated vaccine platform 
      for ZIKV and other clinically relevant flaviviruses.

PG  - 703-712
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jix327 [doi]
AB  - Background: The difficulty in distinguishing infection by Zika virus (ZIKV) from 
      other flaviviruses is a global health concern, particularly given the high risk
      of neurologic complications (including Guillain-Barre syndrome [GBS]) with ZIKV
      infection. Methods: We developed quantitative frameworks to compare and explore
      infectome, diseasome, and comorbidity of ZIKV infections. We analyzed gene
      expression microarray and RNA-Seq data from ZIKV, West Nile fever (WNF),
      chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis virus, GBS, and control 
      datasets. Using neighborhood-based benchmarking and multilayer network topology, 
      we constructed relationship networks based on the Online Mendelian Inheritance in
      Man database and our identified significant genes. Results: ZIKV infections
      showed dysregulation in expression of 929 genes. Forty-seven genes were highly
      expressed in both ZIKV and dengue infections. However, ZIKV shared <15
      significant transcripts with other flavivirus infections. Notably, dysregulation 
      of MAFB and SELENBP1 was common to ZIKV, dengue, and GBS infection; ATF5,
      TNFAIP3, and BAMB1 were common to ZIKV, dengue, and WNF; and NAMPT and PMAlP1
      were common to ZIKV, GBS, and WNF. Phylogenetic, ontologic, and pathway analyses 
      showed that ZIKV infection most resembles dengue fever. Conclusions: We have
      developed methodologies to investigate disease mechanisms and predictions for
      infectome, diseasome, and comorbidities quantitatively, and identified particular
      similarities between ZIKV and dengue infections.

TI  - Clinical application of modified bag-of-features coupled with hybrid neural-based
      classifier in dengue fever classification using gene expression data.
PG  - 709-720
LID - 10.1007/s11517-017-1722-y [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever detection and classification have a vital role due to the recent
      outbreaks of different kinds of dengue fever. Recently, the advancement in the
      microarray technology can be employed for such classification process. Several
      studies have established that the gene selection phase takes a significant role
      in the classifier performance. Subsequently, the current study focused on
      detecting two different variations, namely, dengue fever (DF) and dengue
      hemorrhagic fever (DHF). A modified bag-of-features method has been proposed to
      select the most promising genes in the classification process. Afterward, a
      modified cuckoo search optimization algorithm has been engaged to support the
      artificial neural (ANN-MCS) to classify the unknown subjects into three different
      classes namely, DF, DHF, and another class containing convalescent and normal
      cases. The proposed method has been compared with other three well-known
      classifiers, namely, multilayer perceptron feed-forward network (MLP-FFN),
      artificial neural network (ANN) trained with cuckoo search (ANN-CS), and ANN
      trained with PSO (ANN-PSO). Experiments have been carried out with different
      number of clusters for the initial bag-of-features-based feature selection phase.
      After obtaining the reduced dataset, the hybrid ANN-MCS model has been employed
      for the classification process. The results have been compared in terms of the
      confusion matrix-based performance measuring metrics. The experimental results
      indicated a highly statistically significant improvement with the proposed
      classifier over the traditional ANN-CS model.

TI  - Relative risk estimation of dengue disease at small spatial scale.
PG  - 31
LID - 10.1186/s12942-017-0104-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a high incidence arboviral disease in tropical countries
      around the world. Colombia is an endemic country due to the favourable
      environmental conditions for vector survival and spread. Dengue surveillance in
      Colombia is based in passive notification of cases, supporting monitoring,
      prediction, risk factor identification and intervention measures. Even though the
      surveillance network works adequately, disease mapping techniques currently
      developed and employed for many health problems are not widely applied. We select
      the Colombian city of Bucaramanga to apply Bayesian areal disease mapping models,
      testing the challenges and difficulties of the approach. METHODS: We estimated
      the relative risk of dengue disease by census section (a geographical unit
      composed approximately by 1-20 city blocks) for the period January 2008 to
      December 2015. We included the covariates normalized difference vegetation index 
      (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST), obtained by satellite images. We
      fitted Bayesian areal models at the complete period and annual aggregation time
      scales for 2008-2015, with fixed and space-varying coefficients for the
      covariates, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we used
      Cohen's Kappa agreement measures to compare the risk from year to year, and from 
      every year to the complete period aggregation. RESULTS: We found the NDVI
      providing more information than LST for estimating relative risk of dengue,
      although their effects were small. NDVI was directly associated to high relative 
      risk of dengue. Risk maps of dengue were produced from the estimates obtained by 
      the modeling process. The year to year risk agreement by census section was
      sligth to fair. CONCLUSION: The study provides an example of implementation of
      relative risk estimation using Bayesian models for disease mapping at small
      spatial scale with covariates. We relate satellite data to dengue disease, using 
      an areal data approach, which is not commonly found in the literature. The main
      difficulty of the study was to find quality data for generating expected values
      as input for the models. We remark the importance of creating population registry
      at small spatial scale, which is not only relevant for the risk estimation of
      dengue but also important to the surveillance of all notifiable diseases.

TI  - Increasing airline travel may facilitate co-circulation of multiple dengue virus 
      serotypes in Asia.
PG  - e0005694
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005694 [doi]
AB  - The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades worldwide,
      especially in Southeast Asia and the Americas with substantial transmission in
      2014-2015. Yet the mechanisms underlying the spatio-temporal circulation of
      dengue virus (DENV) serotypes at large geographical scales remain elusive. Here
      we investigate the co-circulation in Asia of DENV serotypes 1-3 from 1956 to
      2015, using a statistical framework that jointly estimates migration history and 
      quantifies potential predictors of viral spatial diffusion, including
      socio-economic, air transportation and maritime mobility data. We find that the
      spread of DENV-1, -2 and -3 lineages in Asia is significantly associated with air
      traffic. Our analyses suggest the network centrality of air traffic hubs such as 
      Thailand and India contribute to seeding dengue epidemics, whilst China,
      Cambodia, Indonesia, and Singapore may establish viral diffusion links with
      multiple countries in Asia. Phylogeographic reconstructions help to explain how
      growing air transportation networks could influence the dynamics of DENV
      circulation.

TI  - An "on-matrix" digestion procedure for AP-MS experiments dissects the interplay

      virus-human plasma interactome.

AB  - The interactions between the four Dengue virus (DENV) serotypes and plasma
      proteins are crucial in the initial steps of viral infection to humans. Affinity 
      purification combined with quantitative mass spectrometry analysis, has become
      one of the most powerful tools for the investigation on novel protein-protein
      interactions. Using this approach, we report here that a significant number of
      bait-interacting proteins do not dissociate under standard elution conditions,
      i.e. acid pH and chaotropic agents, and that this problem can be circumvented by 
      using the "on-matrix" digestion procedure described here. This procedure enabled 
      the identification of 16 human plasma proteins interacting with domain III from
      the envelope protein of DENV serotypes 1, 3 and 4 that would have not been
      detected otherwise and increased the known DIIIE interactors in human plasma to
      59 proteins. Selected Reaction Monitoring analysis evidenced DENV interactome in 
      human plasma is rather conserved although significant differences on the
      reactivity of viral serotypes with specific proteins do exist. A comparison
      between the serotype-dependent profile of reactivity and the conservation pattern
      of amino acid residues suggests an evolutionary selection of highly conserved
      interactions with the host and other interactions mediated for surface regions of
      higher variability. SIGNIFICANCE: False negative results on the identification of
      interacting proteins in pull-down experiments compromise the subsequent
      interpretation of results and the formulation of a working hypothesis for the
      derived future work. In this study we demonstrate the presence of
      bait-interacting proteins reluctant to dissociate under elution conditions of
      acid pH and presence of chaotropics. We propose the direct proteolytic digestion 
      of proteins while still bound to the affinity matrix ("on-matrix" digestion) and 
      evaluate the impact of this methodology in the comparative study of the
      interactome of the four serotypes of Dengue virus mediated by the domain III of
      the viral envelope glycoprotein. Fifty nine proteins were identified as putative 
      interaction partners of Dengue virus (IPs) either due to direct binding or by
      co-isolation with interacting proteins. Collectively the IPs identified from the 
      pull-down with the recombinant domain III proteins representing the four viral
      serotypes, 29% were identified only after "on-matrix" digestion which demonstrate
      the usefulness of this method of recovering bait-bound proteins. Results
      highlight a particular importance of "on-matrix" digestion procedure for
      comparative studies where a stronger interaction with one of the interest baits
      could prevent a bound protein to elute under standard conditions thus leading to 
      misinterpretation as absent in the interactome of this particular bait. The
      analysis of the Interaction Network indicates that Dengue virus interactome
      mediated by the domain III of the envelope protein is rather conserved in the
      viral complex suggesting a key role of these interactions for viral infection
      thus making candidates to explore for potential biomarkers of clinical outcome in
      DENV-caused disease. Interestingly, some particular IPs exhibit significant
      differences in the strength of the interaction with the viral serotypes
      representing interactions that involve more variable regions in the surface of
      the domain III. Since such variable regions are the consequence of the
      interaction with antibodies generated by human immune response; this result
      relates the interaction with proteins from human plasma with the interplay of the
      virus and the human immune system.

AB  - Vector-borne diseases transmitted by insect vectors such as mosquitoes occur in
      over 100 countries and affect almost half of the world's population. Dengue is
      currently the most prevalent arboviral disease but chikungunya, Zika and yellow
      fever show increasing prevalence and severity. Vector control, mainly by the use 
      of insecticides, play a key role in disease prevention but the use of the same
      chemicals for more than 40 years, together with the dissemination of mosquitoes
      by trade and environmental changes, resulted in the global spread of insecticide 
      resistance. In this context, innovative tools and strategies for vector control, 
      including the management of resistance, are urgently needed. This report
      summarizes the main outputs of the first international workshop on Insecticide
      resistance in vectors of arboviruses held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 5-8 December
      2016. The primary aims of this workshop were to identify strategies for the
      development and implementation of standardized insecticide resistance management,
      also to allow comparisons across nations and across time, and to define research 
      priorities for control of vectors of arboviruses. The workshop brought together
      163 participants from 28 nationalities and was accessible, live, through the web 
      (> 70,000 web-accesses over 3 days).

AB  - Aedes albopictus is one of the most invasive species, which can carry Dengue
      virus, Yellow fever virus and more than twenty arboviruses. Based on
      mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and samples collected from 17
      populations, we investigated the molecular character and genetic diversity of Ae.
      albopictus from China. Altogether, 25 haplotypes were detected, including 10
      shared haplotypes and 15 private haplotypes. H1 was the dominant haplotype, which
      is widely distributed in 13 populations. Tajima'D value of most populations was
      significantly negative, demonstrating that populations experienced rapid range
      expansion recently. Most haplotypes clustered together both in phylogenetic and
      median-joining network analysis without clear phylogeographic patterns. However, 
      neutrality tests revealed shallow divergences among Hainan and Guangxi with other
      populations (0.15599 </= FST </= 0.75858), which probably due to interrupted gene
      flow, caused by geographical isolations. In conclusion, Ae. albopictus
      populations showed low genetic diversity in China.

TI  - Simultaneous detection of chikungunya virus, dengue virus and human pathogenic
      Leptospira genomes using a multiplex TaqMan(R) assay.
PG  - 105
LID - 10.1186/s12866-017-1019-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2005-2006 a major epidemics of Chikungunya disease occurred in
      South-West Indian Ocean islands. In Reunion Island, the magnitude of Chikungunya 
      infection related symptoms was high and with over 38% of serological prevalence
      in the population. This epidemics illustrated the potential threat of emerging
      arboviral diseases for inhabitants of Reunion Island and elsewhere since vectors 
      are worldwide distributed. A sentinel surveillance network was set-up to detect
      emerging pathogens associated with fever over 38 degrees C and in the absence of 
      known etiologic causes. Leptospirosis is caused by a pathogenic spirochete of the
      Leptospira genus and is an endemic and recurrent seasonal disease of great
      concern in Reunion Island. To accurately diagnose potentially infected patients
      and to advise Health authorities on the presence of emerging pathogens, a rapid
      diagnostic test was needed that could differentiate between these 3 pathogens.
      METHODS: A one-step multiplex real-time PCR assay was developed that can
      simultaneously detect RNA of Chikungunya and Dengue viruses and leptospiral DNA
      with good performance for a routine diagnostic use. RESULTS: Simplex protocols
      already published were used with key modifications to implement a triplex assay
      which was set-up with a small reaction volume to improve cost efficiency.
      CONCLUSIONS: This approach has enabled greater diagnostic capacity in our
      laboratory. We established a multiplex approach validated and valuable for cost
      savings, and with the concurrent detection of 3 pathogens of public health
      concern.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the current global trend of reduction in the morbidity and
      mortality of neglected diseases, dengue's incidence has increased and occurrence 
      areas have expanded. Dengue also persists as a scientific and technological
      challenge since there is no effective treatment, vaccine, vector control or
      public health intervention. Combining bibliometrics and social network analysis
      methods can support the mapping of dengue research and development (R&D)
      activities worldwide. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to map the scientific 
      scenario related to dengue research worldwide. METHODS: We use scientific
      publication data from Web of Science Core Collection - articles indexed in
      Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) - and combine bibliometrics and
      social network analysis techniques to identify the most relevant journals,
      scientific references, research areas, countries and research organisations in
      the dengue scientific landscape. FINDINGS: Our results show a significant
      increase of dengue publications over time; tropical medicine and virology as the 
      most frequent research areas and biochemistry and molecular biology as the most
      central area in the network; USA and Brazil as the most productive countries; and
      Mahidol University and Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz as the main research organisations
      and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention as the most central
      organisation in the collaboration network. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our findings can be 
      used to strengthen a global knowledge platform guiding policy, planning and
      funding decisions as well as to providing directions to researchers and
      institutions. So that, by offering to the scientific community, policy makers and
      public health practitioners a mapping of the dengue scientific landscape, this
      paper has aimed to contribute to upcoming debates, decision-making and planning
      on dengue R&D and public health strategies worldwide.

AB  - Metabolomics is an analytical profiling technique for measuring and comparing
      large numbers of metabolites present in biological samples. Combining
      high-throughput analytical chemistry and multivariate data analysis, metabolomics
      offers a window on metabolic mechanisms. Because they intimately utilize and
      often rewire host metabolism, viruses are an excellent choice to study by
      metabolomics techniques. Studies of the effects of viruses on metabolism during
      replication in vitro and infection in animal models or human subjects have
      provided novel insights into these networks and provided new targets for therapy 
      and biomarker development. Identifying the common metabolic pathways utilized by 
      viruses has the potential to reveal those that can be targeted by broad-spectrum 
      antiviral and vaccine approaches.

AB  - In many countries afflicted with dengue fever, traditional medicines are widely
      used as panaceas for illness, and here we describe the systematic evaluation of a
      widely known natural product, luteolin, originating from the "heat clearing"
      class of herbs. We show that luteolin inhibits the replication of all four
      serotypes of dengue virus, but the selectivity of the inhibition was weak. In
      addition, ADE-mediated dengue virus infection of human cell lines and primary
      PBMCs was inhibited. In a time-of-drug-addition study, luteolin was found to
      reduce infectious virus particle formation, but not viral RNA synthesis, in Huh-7
      cells. During the virus life cycle, the host protease furin cleaves the pr moiety
      from prM protein of immature virus particles in the trans-Golgi network to
      produce mature virions. Analysis of virus particles from luteolin-treated cells
      revealed that prM was not cleaved efficiently. Biochemical interrogation of human
      furin showed that luteolin inhibited the enzyme activity in an uncompetitive
      manner, with Ki value of 58.6 muM, suggesting that treatment may restrict the
      virion maturation process. Luteolin also exhibited in vivo antiviral activity in 
      mice infected with DENV, causing reduced viremia. Given the mode of action of
      luteolin and its widespread source, it is possible that it can be tested in
      combination with other dengue virus inhibitors.

TI  - Surveillance of Arthropod-Borne Viruses and Their Vectors in the Mediterranean
      and Black Sea Regions Within the MediLabSecure Network.
PG  - 27-39
LID - 10.1007/s40475-017-0101-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Arboviruses, viruses transmitted by arthropods such as
      mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies, and fleas are a significant threat to public health
      because of their epidemic and zoonotic potential. The geographical distribution
      of mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile (WN), Rift Valley fever (RVF),
      Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika has expanded over the last decades. Countries of
      the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions are not spared. Outbreaks of WN are
      repeatedly reported in the Mediterranean basin. Human cases of RVF were reported 
      at the southern borders of the Maghreb region. For this reason, establishing the 
      basis for the research to understand the potential for the future emergence of
      these and other arboviruses and their expansion into new geographic areas became 
      a public health priority. In this context, the European network "MediLabSecure"
      gathering laboratories in 19 non-EU countries from the Mediterranean and Black
      Sea regions seeks to improve the surveillance (of animals, humans, and vectors)
      by reinforcing capacity building and harmonizing national surveillance systems to
      address this important human and veterinary health issue. The aim of this review 
      is to give an exhaustive overview of arboviruses and their vectors in the region.
      RECENT FINDINGS: The data presented underline the importance of surveillance in
      the implementation of more adapted control strategies to combat vector-borne
      diseases. Partner laboratories within the MediLabSecure network present a wide
      range of infrastructures and have benefited from different training programs.
      SUMMARY: Although reporting of arboviral presence is not carried out in a
      systematic manner, the expansion of the area where arboviruses are present cannot
      be disputed. This reinforces the need for increasing surveillance capacity
      building in this region to prevent future emergences.

TI  - Screening of Wolbachia Endosymbiont Infection in Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes Using
      Attenuated Total Reflection Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy.
PG  - 5285-5293
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04827 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever is the most common mosquito transmitted viral infection afflicting
      humans, estimated to generate around 390 million infections each year in over 100
      countries. The introduction of the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia into Aedes
      aegypti mosquitoes has the potential to greatly reduce the public health burden
      of the disease. This approach requires extensive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      testing of the Wolbachia-infection status of mosquitoes in areas where
      Wolbachia-A. aegypti are released. Here, we report the first example of small
      organism mid-infrared spectroscopy where we have applied attenuated total
      reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FT-IR) spectroscopy and multivariate
      modeling methods to determine sex, age, and the presence of Wolbachia (wMel
      strain) in laboratory mosquitoes and sex and age in field mosquitoes. The
      prediction errors using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)
      discrimination models for laboratory studies on independent test sets ranged from
      0 to 3% for age and sex grading and 3% to 5% for Wolbachia infection diagnosis
      using dry mosquito abdomens while field study results using an artificial neural 
      network yielded a 10% error. The application of FT-IR analysis is inexpensive,
      easy to use, and portable and shows significant potential to replace the reliance
      on more expensive and laborious PCR assays.

AB  - The Global Virus Network (GVN) was established in 2011 in order to strengthen
      research and responses to current viral causes of human disease and to prepare
      against new viral pandemic threats. There are now 38 GVN Centers of Excellence
      and 6 Affiliate laboratories in 24 countries. GVN scientists meet annually to
      learn about each other's current research, address collaborative priorities and
      plan future programs. The 2016 meeting was held from October 23-25 in Hokkaido,
      Japan, in partnership with the Japanese Society for Virology, the National
      Institute of Infectious Diseases of Japan and the Research Center for Zoonosis
      Control of Hokkaido University. This report highlights the accomplishments of GVN
      researchers in many priority areas of medical virology, including the current
      Zika epidemic, infections by human papillomavirus, influenza, Ebola, Lassa,
      dengue, HIV, hepatitis C, and chikungunya viruses, and the development of
      improved diagnostics and new vaccines.

TI  - Surveillance report of Zika virus among Canadian travellers returning from the
      Americas.
PG  - E334-E340
LID - 10.1503/cmaj.161241 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Widespread transmission of Zika virus in the Americas has occurred
      since late 2015. We examined demographic and travel-related characteristics of
      returned Canadian travellers with Zika infection acquired in the Americas to
      illuminate risk factors for acquisition and the clinical spectrum. METHODS: We
      analyzed demographic and travel-related data for returned Canadian travellers who
      presented to a CanTravNet site between October 2015 and September 2016 for care
      of Zika virus acquired in the Americas. Data were collected with use of the
      GeoSentinel Surveillance Network data platform. RESULTS: During the study period,
      1118 travellers presented to a CanTravNet site after returning from the Americas,
      41 (3.7%) of whom had Zika infection. Zika infection from the Americas was
      diagnosed at CanTravNet sites as often as dengue (n = 41) over the study period. 
      In the first half of the study period, Zika virus burden was borne by people
      visiting friends and relatives in South America. In the latter half, coincident
      with the increased spread of Zika throughout the Caribbean and Central America,
      Zika virus occurred more often in tourists in the Caribbean. Forty (98%) of the
      travellers with Zika infection acquired it through probable mosquito exposure,
      and 1 had confirmed sexual acquisition. Congenital transmission occurred in 2 of 
      3 pregnancies. Two (5%) of those with Zika had symptoms resembling those of
      Guillain-Barre syndrome, 1 of whom also had Zika viral meningitis.
      INTERPRETATION: Even in this small cohort, we observed the full clinical spectrum
      of acute Zika virus, including adverse fetal and neurologic outcomes. Our
      observations suggest that complications from Zika infection are underestimated by
      data arising exclusively from populations where Zika is endemic. Travellers
      should adhere to mosquito-avoidance measures and barrier protection during sexual
      activity.

AB  - The risk of local transmission of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses from
      viremic travelers arriving from affected areas is a real possibility in southern 
      Europe, due to the large presence of the vector Aedes albopictus. The first
      chikungunya outbreak in Europe occurred in the Emilia-Romagna region, Italy, in
      2007, prompting the regional public health department to implement an Ae.
      albopictus monitoring and control plan. This paper presents the procedure
      developed for the quality control of the data collected by the regional ovitrap
      monitoring network. The quality control procedure consists of four successive
      steps; the first step is data acquisition and the second is an automatic data
      processing step, while skilled technicians according to specific procedures
      perform the third and fourth steps by checking the exact position of the ovitraps
      and by conducting human landing collections, respectively. The paper also
      presents the results of this quality control procedure applied to the data
      collected through the large-scale Ae. albopictus monitoring operation performed
      in Emilia-Romagna in 2015.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To propose a vector-host mathematical model for adjusting the force of
      infection with dengue in a variable population with logistic growth and a
      mosquito life cycle with periodic oviposition rate, considering immunity to a
      serotype. METHODS : The proposed mathematical model is represented by eight
      differential equations that calculate the force of infection through the
      scale-free network method. RESULTS: A simulation of the mathematical model solved
      by an algorithm implemented in MATLAB based on data obtained from the literature 
      was obtained. The growth of the force of dengue infection over time can be
      observed in the simulation, and it varies as some parameters change. CONCLUSIONS:
      The force of infection increases over time, that is, the rate of new cases
      increases, which proves the need for prevention among inhabitants of high-risk
      areas through the use of metallic fabrics, mosquito nets, repellents, appropriate
      clothing, among other measures. Chemical control against the vector, such as
      larvicides and adulticides, as well as the elimination of breeding places to
      interrupt their life cycle are strongly advised.

TI  - The role of the unfolded protein response in dengue virus pathogenesis.
LID - 10.1111/cmi.12734 [doi]
AB  - Symptomatic dengue virus (DENV) infections range from mild fever to severe
      haemorrhagic disease and death. Host-viral interactions play a significant role
      in deciding the fate of the infection. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a
      prosurvival cellular reaction induced in response to DENV-mediated endoplasmic
      reticulum stress. The UPR has complex interactions with the cellular autophagy
      machinery, apoptosis, and innate immunity. DENV has evolved to manipulate the UPR
      to facilitate its replication and to evade host immunity. Our knowledge of this
      intertwined network of events is continuously developing. A better understanding 
      of the UPR mediated antiviral and proviral effects will shed light on dengue
      disease pathogenesis and may help development of anti-DENV therapeutics. This
      review summarizes the role of the UPR in viral replication, autophagy, and
      DENV-induced inflammation to describe how a host response contributes to DENV
      pathogenesis.

TI  - Holding back the tiger: Successful control program protects Australia from Aedes 
      albopictus expansion.
PG  - e0005286
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an important vector of
      dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses and is a highly invasive and aggressive
      biter. Established populations of this species were first recognised in Australia
      in 2005 when they were discovered on islands in the Torres Strait, between
      mainland Australia and Papua New Guinea. A control program was implemented with
      the original goal of eliminating Ae. albopictus from the Torres Strait. We
      describe the evolution of management strategies that provide a template for Ae.
      albopictus control that can be adopted elsewhere. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL
      FINDINGS: The control strategy implemented between 2005 and 2008 targeted larval 
      habitats using source reduction, insect-growth regulator and pyrethroid
      insecticide to control larvae and adults in the containers. However, the
      infrequency of insecticide reapplication, the continual accumulation and
      replacement of containers, and imminent re-introduction of mosquitoes through
      people's movement from elsewhere compromised the program. Consequently, in 2009
      the objective of the program changed from elimination to quarantine, with the
      goal of preventing Ae albopictus from infesting Thursday and Horn islands, which 
      are the transport hubs connecting the Torres Strait to mainland Australia.
      However, larval control strategies did not prevent the species establishing on
      these islands in 2010. Thereafter, an additional strategy adopted by the
      quarantine program in early 2011 was harborage spraying, whereby the vegetated,
      well shaded resting sites of adult Ae. albopictus were treated with a residual
      pyrethroid insecticide. Inclusion of this additional measure led to a 97% decline
      in Ae. albopictus numbers within two years. In addition, the frequency of
      container treatment was increased to five weeks between treatments, compared to
      an average of 8 weeks that occurred in the earlier iterations of the program. By 
      2015 and 2016, Ae. albopictus populations on the two islands were undetectable in
      70-90% of surveys conducted. Importantly, a comprehensive surveillance network in
      selected strategic areas has not identified established populations of this
      species on the Australian mainland. CONCLUSIONS / SIGNIFICANCE: The program has
      successfully reduced Ae. albopictus populations on Thursday Island and Horn
      Island to levels where it is undetectable in up to 90% of surveys, and has
      largely removed the risk of mainland establishment via that route. The vector
      management strategies adopted in the later years of the program have been
      demonstrably successful and provide a practical management framework for dengue, 
      chikungunya or Zika virus outbreaks vectored by Ae. albopictus. As of June 2016, 
      Ae. albopictus had not established on the Australian mainland and this program
      has likely contributed significantly to this outcome.

TI  - ZIKA Virus and Neuroscience: the Need for a Translational Collaboration.
PG  - 1551-1555
LID - 10.1007/s12035-017-0429-2 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a major challenge for scientists and health
      agencies. ZIKV's involvement with human fetal microcephaly and Guillain-Barre
      syndrome and its transmission through Aedes africanus and Aedes aegypti mosquitos
      highlighted the epidemiological and neurological risks associated to ZIKV
      infection. In 2013, ZIKV arrives in Brazil but the first outbreak in the country 
      was reported in 2015. Here, we used the Web of Science as a search tool for
      comparing the evolution of world and Brazilian scientific research on dengue
      virus (DENV)-also present in mosquito-, ZIKV and microcephaly. The association
      between ZIKV and microcephaly was only evidenced in 2015. Interestingly, Brazil
      and the USA are the responsible for most of these reports. Furthermore, the level
      of double-counted articles indicates a high degree of international collaborative
      effort in studying ZIKV and microcephaly. The ZIKV research clearly requires
      multidisciplinary expertise including epidemiologic, clinical, virological, and
      neurochemical backgrounds. This letter intends to emphasize the need of
      multidisciplinary studies and put forward some as yet unanswered questions in
      attempting to contribute to the understanding of this multifaceted health
      problem. In line with this, we recently constituted a collaborative and
      multidisciplinary taskforce encompassing eight Brazilian scientific institutions 
      of excellence, The ZIKV translational research taskforce. This taskforce
      comprises a vast international network of collaborators and welcomes additional
      collaborators. We intend to advance fast in terms of mechanisms, which can
      potentially contribute to treat or halt ZIKV spreading around the world.

AB  - Dengue virus is an arthropod-borne virus transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitos
      and is major cause of disease in tropical and subtropical regions. Colloquially
      known as Dengue Fever, infection can cause hemorrhagic disorders and death in
      humans and non-human primates. We report a novel electronic biosensor based on a 
      single-walled carbon nanotube network chemiresistive transducer that is
      functionalized with heparin for low-cost, label-free, ultra-sensitive, and rapid 
      detection of whole dengue virus (DENV). Heparin, an analog of the heparan sulfate
      proteoglycans that are receptors for dengue virus during infection of Vero cells 
      and hepatocytes, was used for the first time in a biosensor as a biorecognition
      element instead of traditional antibody. Detection of DENV in viral culture
      supernatant has similar sensitivity as the corresponding viral titer in phosphate
      buffer despite the presence of growth media and Vero cell lysate. The biosensor
      demonstrated sensitivity within the clinically relevant range for humans and
      infected Aedes aegypti. It has potential application in clinical diagnosis and
      can improve point-of-care diagnostics of dengue infection.

TI  - A MicroRNA Screen Identifies the Wnt Signaling Pathway as a Regulator of the
      Interferon Response during Flavivirus Infection.
LID - e02388-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02388-16 [doi]
AB  - The impact of mosquito-borne flavivirus infections worldwide is significant, and 
      many critical aspects of these viruses' biology, including virus-host
      interactions, host cell requirements for replication, and how virus-host
      interactions impact pathology, remain to be fully understood. The recent
      reemergence and spread of flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), West Nile 
      virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), highlight the importance of performing basic 
      research on this important group of pathogens. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small,
      noncoding RNAs that modulate gene expression posttranscriptionally and have been 
      demonstrated to regulate a broad range of cellular processes. Our research is
      focused on identifying pro- and antiflaviviral miRNAs as a means of
      characterizing cellular pathways that support or limit viral replication. We have
      screened a library of known human miRNA mimics for their effect on the
      replication of three flaviviruses, DENV, WNV, and Japanese encephalitis virus
      (JEV), using a high-content immunofluorescence screen. Several families of miRNAs
      were identified as inhibiting multiple flaviviruses, including the miRNA miR-34, 
      miR-15, and miR-517 families. Members of the miR-34 family, which have been
      extensively characterized for their ability to repress Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling, demonstrated strong antiflaviviral effects, and this inhibitory
      activity extended to other viruses, including ZIKV, alphaviruses, and
      herpesviruses. Previous research suggested a possible link between the Wnt and
      type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathways. Therefore, we investigated the role
      of type I IFN induction in the antiviral effects of the miR-34 family and
      confirmed that these miRNAs potentiate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)
      phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus, the induction of IFN-responsive
      genes, and the release of type I IFN from transfected cells. We further
      demonstrate that the intersection between the Wnt and IFN signaling pathways
      occurs at the point of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta)-TANK-binding
      kinase 1 (TBK1) binding, inducing TBK1 to phosphorylate IRF3 and initiate
      downstream IFN signaling. In this way, we have identified a novel cellular
      signaling network with a critical role in regulating the replication of multiple 
      virus families. These findings highlight the opportunities for using miRNAs as
      tools to discover and characterize unique cellular factors involved in supporting
      or limiting virus replication, opening up new avenues for antiviral
      research.IMPORTANCE MicroRNAs are a class of small regulatory RNAs that modulate 
      cellular processes through the posttranscriptional repression of multiple
      transcripts. We hypothesized that individual miRNAs may be capable of inhibiting 
      viral replication through their effects on host proteins or pathways. To test
      this, we performed a high-content screen for miRNAs that inhibit the replication 
      of three medically relevant members of the flavivirus family: West Nile virus,
      Japanese encephalitis virus, and dengue virus 2. The results of this screen
      identify multiple miRNAs that inhibit one or more of these viruses. Extensive
      follow-up on members of the miR-34 family of miRNAs, which are active against all
      three viruses as well as the closely related Zika virus, demonstrated that miR-34
      functions through increasing the infected cell's ability to respond to infection 
      through the interferon-based innate immune pathway. Our results not only add to
      the knowledge of how viruses interact with cellular pathways but also provide a
      basis for more extensive data mining by providing a comprehensive list of miRNAs 
      capable of inhibiting flavivirus replication. Finally, the miRNAs themselves or
      cellular pathways identified as modulating virus infection may prove to be novel 
      candidates for the development of therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Key steps in the life cycle of a virus, such as the fusion event as the virus
      infects a host cell and its maturation process, relate to an intricate interplay 
      between the structure and the dynamics of its constituent proteins, especially
      those that define its capsid, much akin to an envelope that protects its genomic 
      material. We present a comprehensive, comparative analysis of such interplay for 
      the capsids of two viruses from the flaviviridae family, Dengue (DENV) and Zika
      (ZIKV). We use for that purpose our own software suite, DD-NMA, which is based on
      normal mode analysis. We describe the elements of DD-NMA that are relevant to the
      analysis of large systems, such as virus capsids. In particular, we introduce our
      implementation of simplified elastic networks and justify their parametrization. 
      Using DD-NMA, we illustrate the importance of packing interactions within the
      virus capsids on the dynamics of the E proteins of DENV and ZIKV. We identify
      differences between the computed atomic fluctuations of the E proteins in DENV
      and ZIKV and relate those differences to changes observed in their high
      resolution structures. We conclude with a discussion on additional analyses that 
      are needed to fully characterize the dynamics of the two viruses.

TI  - Contextual Hub Analysis Tool (CHAT): A Cytoscape app for identifying contextually
      relevant hubs in biological networks.
PG  - 1745
AB  - Highly connected nodes (hubs) in biological networks are topologically important 
      to the structure of the network and have also been shown to be preferentially
      associated with a range of phenotypes of interest. The relative importance of a
      hub node, however, can change depending on the biological context. Here, we
      report a Cytoscape app, the Contextual Hub Analysis Tool (CHAT), which enables
      users to easily construct and visualize a network of interactions from a gene or 
      protein list of interest, integrate contextual information, such as gene
      expression or mass spectrometry data, and identify hub nodes that are more highly
      connected to contextual nodes (e.g. genes or proteins that are differentially
      expressed) than expected by chance. In a case study, we use CHAT to construct a
      network of genes that are differentially expressed in Dengue fever, a viral
      infection. CHAT was used to identify and compare contextual and degree-based hubs
      in this network. The top 20 degree-based hubs were enriched in pathways related
      to the cell cycle and cancer, which is likely due to the fact that proteins
      involved in these processes tend to be highly connected in general. In
      comparison, the top 20 contextual hubs were enriched in pathways commonly
      observed in a viral infection including pathways related to the immune response
      to viral infection. This analysis shows that such contextual hubs are
      considerably more biologically relevant than degree-based hubs and that analyses 
      which rely on the identification of hubs solely based on their connectivity may
      be biased towards nodes that are highly connected in general rather than in the
      specific context of interest. AVAILABILITY: CHAT is available for Cytoscape 3.0+ 
      and can be installed via the Cytoscape App Store (
      http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/chat).

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Evolution of Dengue Incidence in Brazil, 2001-2012.
PG  - e0165945
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0165945 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Brazil, the incidence of dengue greatly increased in the last two 
      decades and there are several factors impeding the control of the disease. The
      present study focused on describing the space-time evolution of dengue in Brazil 
      from 2001 to 2012 and analyzing the relationship of the reported cases with
      socio-demographic and environmental factors. METHODS: The analytic units used in 
      the preparation of thematic maps were municipalities. Statistical tests and
      multilevel regression models were used to evaluate the association between dengue
      incidence and the following factors: climate, diagnostic period, demographic
      density, percentage of people living in rural areas, Gross Domestic Product, Gini
      index, percentage of garbage collection and the rate of households with a sewage 
      network. RESULTS: The largest accumulation of dengue cases in Brazil was
      concentrated on the Atlantic coast and in the interior part of Sao Paulo State.
      The risk of dengue in subtropical and tropical climates was 1.20-11 times lower
      than that observed in semi-arid climates. In 2009-2010 and 2011-2012, the risks
      were ten and six times higher than in 2003-2004, respectively. CONCLUSION: Dengue
      is a common infection in the Brazilian population, with the largest accumulation 
      of dengue cases concentrated on the Atlantic coast and in the interior area of
      Sao Paulo State. The high dengue rates observed in the Brazilian coastal region
      suggest that the cases imported from neighboring countries contribute to the
      spread of the disease in the country. Our results suggest that several
      socio-demographic and environmental factors resulted in the increase of dengue in
      the country over time. This is likely applicable to the occurrence of other
      arboviruses like Zika and chikungunya. To reverse the situation, Brazil must
      implement effective public policies that offer basic services such as garbage
      collection and sanitation networks as well as reduce vector populations.

TI  - Dengue research networks: building evidence for policy and planning in Brazil.
PG  - 80
AB  - BACKGROUND: The analysis of scientific networks has been applied in health
      research to map and measure relationships between researchers and institutions,
      describing collaboration structures, individual roles, and research outputs, and 
      helping the identification of knowledge gaps and cooperation opportunities.
      Driven by dengue continued expansion in Brazil, we explore the contribution,
      dynamics and consolidation of dengue scientific networks that could ultimately
      inform the prioritisation of research, financial investments and health policy.
      METHOD: Social network analysis (SNA) was used to produce a 20-year (1995-2014)
      retrospective longitudinal evaluation of dengue research networks within Brazil
      and with its partners abroad, with special interest in describing institutional
      collaboration and their research outputs. RESULTS: The analysis of institutional 
      co-authorship showed a significant expansion of collaboration over the years,
      increased international involvement, and ensured a shift from public health
      research toward vector control and basic biomedical research, probably as a
      reflection of the expansion of transmission, high burden and increasing research 
      funds from the Brazilian government. The analysis identified leading national
      organisations that maintained the research network connectivity, facilitated
      knowledge exchange and reduced network vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: SNA proved to 
      be a valuable tool that, along with other indicators, can strengthen a knowledge 
      platform to inform future policy, planning and funding decisions. The paper
      provides relevant information to policy and planning for dengue research as it
      reveals: (1) the effectiveness of the research network in knowledge generation,
      sharing and diffusion; (2) the near-absence of collaboration with the private
      sector; and (3) the key central organisations that can support strategic
      decisions on investments, development and implementation of innovations. In
      addition, the increase in research activities and collaboration has not yet
      significantly affected dengue transmission, suggesting a limited translation of
      research efforts into public health solutions.

TI  - From ZikV genome to vaccine: in silico approach for the epitope-based peptide
      vaccine against Zika virus envelope glycoprotein.
PG  - 386-399
LID - 10.1111/imm.12656 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZikV) has emerged as a potential threat to human health worldwide. A 
      member of the Flaviviridae, ZikV is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. It is
      related to other pathogenic vector-borne flaviviruses including dengue, West Nile
      and Japanese encephalitis viruses, but produces a comparatively mild disease in
      humans. As a result of its epidemic outbreak and the lack of potential
      medication, there is a need for improved vaccine/drugs. Computational techniques 
      will provide further information about this virus. Comparative analysis of ZikV
      genomes should lead to the identification of the core characteristics that define
      a virus family, as well as its unique properties, while phylogenetic analysis
      will show the evolutionary relationships and provide clues about the protein's
      ancestry. Envelope glycoprotein of ZikV was obtained from a protein database and 
      the most immunogenic epitope for T cells and B cells involved in cell-mediated
      immunity, whereas B cells are primarily responsible for humoral immunity. We
      mainly focused on MHC class I potential peptides. YRIMLSVHG, VLIFLSTAV and
      MMLELDPPF, GLDFSDLYY are the most potent peptides predicted as epitopes for
      CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, respectively, whereas MMLELDPPF and GLDFSDLYY had the 
      highest pMHC-I immunogenicity score and these are further tested for interaction 
      against the HLA molecules, using in silico docking techniques to verify the
      binding cleft epitope. However, this is an introductory approach to design an
      epitope-based peptide vaccine against ZikV; we hope that this model will be
      helpful in designing and predicting novel vaccine candidates.

TI  - Dengue Virus Seroconversion in Travelers to Dengue-Endemic Areas.
PG  - 1130-1136
AB  - We conducted a prospective study to measure dengue virus (DENV) antibody
      seroconversion in travelers to dengue-endemic areas. Travelers seen in the Boston
      Area Travel Medicine Network planning to visit dengue-endemic countries for >/= 2
      weeks were enrolled from 2009 to 2010. Pre- and post-travel blood samples and
      questionnaires were collected. Post-travel sera were tested for anti-DENV IgG by 
      indirect IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and anti-DENV IgM by
      capture IgM ELISA. Participants with positive post-travel anti-DENV IgG or IgM
      were tested for pre-travel anti-DENV IgG and IgM; they were excluded from the
      seroconversion calculation if either pre-travel anti-DENV IgG or IgM were
      positive. Paired sera and questionnaires were collected for 62% (589/955) of
      enrolled travelers. Most participants were 19-64 years of age, female, and white.
      The most common purposes of travel were tourism and visiting friends and
      relatives; most trips were to Asia or Africa. Median length of travel was 21
      days. DENV antibody seroconversion by either anti-DENV IgM or IgG ELISA was
      2.9-6.8%; lower range percent excluded potential false-positive anti-DENV IgG due
      to receipt of yellow fever or Japanese encephalitis vaccines at enrollment; upper
      range percent excluded proven false-positive anti-DENV IgM. Eighteen percent of
      those with seroconversion reported dengue-like symptoms. Seroconversion was
      documented for travel to Africa as well as countries and regions known to be
      highly dengue endemic (India, Brazil, southeast Asia). Given widespread risk of
      dengue, travel medicine counseling should include information on risk of dengue
      in endemic areas and advice on preventing insect bites and seeking prompt medical
      attention for febrile illness.

TI  - Risk of transmission of viral haemorrhagic fevers and the insecticide
      susceptibilitystatus of aedes aegypti (linnaeus) in some sites in Accra, Ghana.
PG  - 136-141
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is one of the emerging diseases that can mostly only be
      controlled by vector control since there is no vaccine for the disease. Although,
      Dengue has not been reported in Ghana, movement of people from neighbouring
      countries where the disease has been reported can facilitate transmission of the 
      disease. OBJECTIVE: This study was carried on the University of Ghana campus to
      determine the risk of transmission of viral haemorrhagic fevers and the
      insecticide susceptibility status of Ae. aegypti in some sites in Accra, Ghana.
      DESIGN: Larval surveys were carried to inspect containers within households and
      estimate larval indices and adult Aedes mosquitoes were collected using human
      landing collection technique. WHO tube assays was used to assess the insecticide 
      susceptibility status of Aedes mosquitoes. RESULTS: Ae. aegypti were the most
      prevalent species, 75.5% and followed by Ae. vittatus, 23.9 %. Ae. albopictus and
      Ae. granti were in smaller numbers. Household index (HI), Breteau index (BI), and
      container index were calculated as 8.2%, 11.2% and 10.3% respectively with
      man-vector contact rate of 0.67 bites/man-hour estimated for the area. The
      mortalities recorded for Ae. aegypti from WHO tube assays was 88%, 94%, 80% and
      99% for DDT (4%), deltamethrin (0.05%), lambdacyhalothrin (0.05%) and permethrin 
      (0.75%) respectively. CONCLUSION: The survey results indicated that the density
      of Aedes mosquitoes was considered to be sufficient to promote an outbreak of
      viral haemorrhagic fevers on Legon Campus. Aedes mosquitoes were found to be
      resistant to DDT, deltamethrin and lamdacyhalothrin, but susceptible to
      permethrin. FUNDING: This study was supported in part by Japan Initiative for
      Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases (J-Grid).

TI  - Predicting arboviral disease emergence using Bayesian networks: a case study of
      dengue virus in Western Australia.
PG  - 54-66
AB  - A Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) for assessing the potential risk of dengue virus 
      emergence and distribution in Western Australia (WA) is presented and used to
      identify possible hotspots of dengue outbreaks in summer and winter. The model
      assesses the probabilities of two kinds of events which must take place before an
      outbreak can occur: (1) introduction of the virus and mosquito vectors to places 
      where human population densities are high; and (2) vector population growth rates
      as influenced by climatic factors. The results showed that if either Aedes
      aegypti or Ae. albopictus were to become established in WA, three centres in the 
      northern part of the State (Kununurra, Fitzroy Crossing, Broome) would be at
      particular risk of experiencing an outbreak. The model can also be readily
      extended to predict the risk of introduction of other viruses carried by Aedes
      mosquitoes, such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika viruses.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a human pathogen and its etiology has been widely
      established. There are many interactions between DENV and human proteins that
      have been reported in literature. However, no publicly accessible resource for
      efficiently retrieving the information is yet available. In this study, we mined 
      all publicly available dengue-human interactions that have been reported in the
      literature into a database called DenHunt. We retrieved 682 direct interactions
      of human proteins with dengue viral components, 382 indirect interactions and
      4120 differentially expressed human genes in dengue infected cell lines and
      patients. We have illustrated the importance of DenHunt by mapping the
      dengue-human interactions on to the host interactome and observed that the virus 
      targets multiple host functional complexes of important cellular processes such
      as metabolism, immune system and signaling pathways suggesting a potential role
      of these interactions in viral pathogenesis. We also observed that 7 percent of
      the dengue virus interacting human proteins are also associated with other
      infectious and non-infectious diseases. Finally, the understanding that comes
      from such analyses could be used to design better strategies to counteract the
      diseases caused by dengue virus. The whole dataset has been catalogued in a
      searchable database, called DenHunt
      (http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/DenHunt/).

TI  - Genetic variation of the mitochondrial genes, CO1 and ND5, in Aedes aegypti from 
      various regions of peninsular Malaysia.
PG  - 543-560
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of dengue viruses in many parts of the world.
      In peninsular Malaysia, epidemics of dengue occur more at certain sites
      particularly in the west central region compared to the eastern region. In this
      study, we determined the genetic diversity of Ae. aegypti collected from 19
      localities in 5 regions of peninsular Malaysia based on two mitochondrial DNA
      genes; CO1 and ND5. The total number of haplotypes obtained for CO1 and ND5 gene 
      were 14 (C1-C14) and five (N1-N5), respectively. Haplotype genealogical network
      constructed using concatenated CO1-ND5 gene sequences revealed 18 haplotypes
      (H1-H18) that were separated into two distinct lineages. Phylogenetic analysis
      showed that the first lineage (C11 and C3) was more closely related to those from
      Brazil and France. Unique low frequencies haplotypes detected in the current
      sampling was closely related to those previously found in India, Pakistan and
      Vietnam samples, suggesting recent invasion of these haplotypes through human
      movement or transportation. This is the first study in Malaysia which serves as
      an initial preliminary phase for a much larger study throughout the country. The 
      understanding of the population diversity of Ae. aegypti and its impact on dengue
      transmission will be essential for planning of effective control programmes to
      reduce the burden of dengue.

TI  - A simple grid implementation with Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network
      Computing using BLAST as a model.
PG  - e2248
LID - 10.7717/peerj.2248 [doi]
AB  - Development of high-throughput technologies, such as Next-generation sequencing, 
      allows thousands of experiments to be performed simultaneously while reducing
      resource requirement. Consequently, a massive amount of experiment data is now
      rapidly generated. Nevertheless, the data are not readily usable or meaningful
      until they are further analysed and interpreted. Due to the size of the data, a
      high performance computer (HPC) is required for the analysis and interpretation. 
      However, the HPC is expensive and difficult to access. Other means were developed
      to allow researchers to acquire the power of HPC without a need to purchase and
      maintain one such as cloud computing services and grid computing system. In this 
      study, we implemented grid computing in a computer training center environment
      using Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) as a job
      distributor and data manager combining all desktop computers to virtualize the
      HPC. Fifty desktop computers were used for setting up a grid system during the
      off-hours. In order to test the performance of the grid system, we adapted the
      Basic Local Alignment Search Tools (BLAST) to the BOINC system. Sequencing
      results from Illumina platform were aligned to the human genome database by BLAST
      on the grid system. The result and processing time were compared to those from a 
      single desktop computer and HPC. The estimated durations of BLAST analysis for 4 
      million sequence reads on a desktop PC, HPC and the grid system were 568, 24 and 
      5 days, respectively. Thus, the grid implementation of BLAST by BOINC is an
      efficient alternative to the HPC for sequence alignment. The grid implementation 
      by BOINC also helped tap unused computing resources during the off-hours and
      could be easily modified for other available bioinformatics software.

TI  - Illness in Canadian travellers and migrants from Brazil: CanTravNet surveillance 
      data, 2013-2016.
PG  - 153-157
AB  - Background: In light of the 2016 summer Olympic games it is anticipated that
      Canadian practitioners will require information about common illnesses that may
      affect travellers returning from Brazil. Objective: To identify the demographic
      and travel correlates of illness among recent Canadian travellers and migrants
      from Brazil attending a network of travel health clinics across Canada. Methods: 
      Data was analyzed on returned Canadian travellers and migrants presenting to a
      CanTravNet site for care of an illness between June 2013 and June 2016. Results: 
      During the study period, 7,707 ill travellers and migrants presented to a
      CanTravNet site and 89 (0.01%) acquired their illness in Brazil. Tourists were
      most well represented (n=45, 50.6%), followed by those travelling to "visit
      friends and relatives" (n=14, 15.7%). The median age was 37 years (range <1-78
      years), 49 travellers were men (55.1%) and 40 were women (44.9%). Of the 40
      women, 26 (65%) were of childbearing age. Nine percent (n=8) of travellers were
      diagnosed with arboviruses including dengue (n=6), chikungunya (n=1) and Zika
      virus (n=1), while another 14.6% (n=13) presented for care of non-specific viral 
      syndrome (n=7), non-specific febrile illness (n=1), peripheral neuropathy (n=1)
      and non-specific rash (n=4), which are four syndromes that may be indicative of
      Zika virus infection. Ill returned travellers to Brazil were more likely to
      present for care of arboviral or Zika-like illness than other ill returned
      travellers to South America (23.6 per 100 travellers versus 10.5 per 100
      travellers, respectively [p=0.0024]). Interpretation: An epidemiologic approach
      to illness among returned Canadian travellers to Brazil can inform Canadian
      practitioners encountering both prospective and returned travellers to the
      Olympic games. Analysis showed that vector-borne illnesses such as dengue are
      common and even in this small group of travellers, both chikungunya and Zika
      virus were represented. It is extremely important to educate travellers about
      mosquito-avoidance measures in advance of travel to Brazil.

AB  - Dengue fever is a major public health issue affecting billions of people in over 
      100 countries across the globe. This challenge is growing as the invasive
      mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, expand their distributions 
      and increase their population sizes. Hence there is an increasing need to devise 
      effective control methods that can contain dengue outbreaks. Here we construct an
      epidemiological model for virus transmission between vectors and hosts on a
      network of host populations distributed among city and town patches, and
      investigate disease control through vaccination and vector control using variants
      of the sterile insect technique (SIT). Analysis of the basic reproductive number 
      and simulations indicate that host movement across this small network influences 
      the severity of epidemics. Both vaccination and vector control strategies are
      investigated as methods of disease containment and our results indicate that
      these controls can be made more effective with mixed strategy solutions. We
      predict that reduced lethality through poor SIT methods or imperfectly
      efficacious vaccines will impact efforts to control disease spread. In
      particular, weakly efficacious vaccination strategies against multiple virus
      serotype diversity may be counter productive to disease control efforts. Even so,
      failings of one method may be mitigated by supplementing it with an alternative
      control strategy. Generally, our network approach encourages decision making to
      consider connected populations, to emphasise that successful control methods must
      effectively suppress dengue epidemics at this landscape scale.

TI  - Dengue Virus NS1 Disrupts the Endothelial Glycocalyx, Leading to
      Hyperpermeability.

AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent arboviral disease in humans and a major public
      health problem worldwide. Systemic plasma leakage, leading to hypovolemic shock
      and potentially fatal complications, is a critical determinant of dengue
      severity. Recently, we and others described a novel pathogenic effect of secreted
      dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) in triggering
      hyperpermeability of human endothelial cells in vitro and systemic vascular
      leakage in vivo. NS1 was shown to activate toll-like receptor 4 signaling in
      primary human myeloid cells, leading to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines
      and vascular leakage. However, distinct endothelial cell-intrinsic mechanisms of 
      NS1-induced hyperpermeability remained to be defined. The endothelial glycocalyx 
      layer (EGL) is a network of membrane-bound proteoglycans and glycoproteins lining
      the vascular endothelium that plays a key role in regulating endothelial barrier 
      function. Here, we demonstrate that DENV NS1 disrupts the EGL on human pulmonary 
      microvascular endothelial cells, inducing degradation of sialic acid and shedding
      of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This effect is mediated by NS1-induced
      expression of sialidases and heparanase, respectively. NS1 also activates
      cathepsin L, a lysosomal cysteine proteinase, in endothelial cells, which
      activates heparanase via enzymatic cleavage. Specific inhibitors of sialidases,
      heparanase, and cathepsin L prevent DENV NS1-induced EGL disruption and
      endothelial hyperpermeability. All of these effects are specific to NS1 from
      DENV1-4 and are not induced by NS1 from West Nile virus, a related flavivirus.
      Together, our data suggest an important role for EGL disruption in DENV
      NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction during severe dengue disease.

TI  - Calling in sick: impacts of fever on intra-urban human mobility.
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2016.0390 [doi]
LID - 20160390 [pii]
AB  - Pathogens inflict a wide variety of disease manifestations on their hosts, yet
      the impacts of disease on the behaviour of infected hosts are rarely studied
      empirically and are seldom accounted for in mathematical models of transmission
      dynamics. We explored the potential impacts of one of the most common disease
      manifestations, fever, on a key determinant of pathogen transmission, host
      mobility, in residents of the Amazonian city of Iquitos, Peru. We did so by
      comparing two groups of febrile individuals (dengue-positive and dengue-negative)
      with an afebrile control group. A retrospective, semi-structured interview
      allowed us to quantify multiple aspects of mobility during the two-week period
      preceding each interview. We fitted nested models of each aspect of mobility to
      data from interviews and compared models using likelihood ratio tests to
      determine whether there were statistically distinguishable differences in
      mobility attributable to fever or its aetiology. Compared with afebrile
      individuals, febrile study participants spent more time at home, visited fewer
      locations, and, in some cases, visited locations closer to home and spent less
      time at certain types of locations. These multifaceted impacts are consistent
      with the possibility that disease-mediated changes in host mobility generate
      dynamic and complex changes in host contact network structure.

AB  - Changes in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlie the evolution of
      morphological novelty and developmental system drift. The fruitfly Drosophila
      melanogaster and the dengue and Zika vector mosquito Aedes aegypti have
      substantially similar nervous system morphology. Nevertheless, they show
      significant divergence in a set of genes co-expressed in the midline of the
      Drosophila central nervous system, including the master regulator single minded
      and downstream genes including short gastrulation, Star, and NetrinA. In contrast
      to Drosophila, we find that midline expression of these genes is either absent or
      severely diminished in A. aegypti. Instead, they are co-expressed in the lateral 
      nervous system. This suggests that in A. aegypti this "midline GRN" has been
      redeployed to a new location while lost from its previous site of activity. In
      order to characterize the relevant GRNs, we employed the SCRMshaw method we
      previously developed to identify transcriptional cis-regulatory modules in both
      species. Analysis of these regulatory sequences in transgenic Drosophila suggests
      that the altered gene expression observed in A. aegypti is the result of
      trans-dependent redeployment of the GRN, potentially stemming from cis-mediated
      changes in the expression of sim and other as-yet unidentified regulators. Our
      results illustrate a novel "repeal, replace, and redeploy" mode of evolution in
      which a conserved GRN acquires a different function at a new site while its
      original function is co-opted by a different GRN. This represents a striking
      example of developmental system drift in which the dramatic shift in gene
      expression does not result in gross morphological changes, but in more subtle
      differences in development and function of the late embryonic nervous system.

AB  - Chikungunya is an emerging arbovirus that is characterized into four lineages.
      One of these, the Asian genotype, has spread rapidly in the Americas after its
      introduction in the Saint Martin island in October 2013. Unexpectedly, a new
      lineage, the East-Central-South African genotype, was introduced from Angola in
      the end of May 2014 in Feira de Santana (FSA), the second largest city in Bahia
      state, Brazil, where over 5,500 cases have now been reported. Number weekly cases
      of clinically confirmed CHIKV in FSA were analysed alongside with urban district 
      of residence of CHIKV cases reported between June 2014 and October collected from
      the municipality's surveillance network. The number of cases per week from June
      2014 until September 2015 reveals two distinct transmission waves. The first wave
      ignited in June and transmission ceased by December 2014. However, a second
      transmission wave started in January and peaked in May 2015, 8 months after the
      first wave peak, and this time in phase with Dengue virus and Zika virus
      transmission, which ceased when minimum temperature dropped to approximately 15
      degrees C. We find that shorter travelling times from the district where the
      outbreak first emerged to other urban districts of FSA were strongly associated
      with incidence in each district in 2014 (R(2)).

TI  - Estimating risks of importation and local transmission of Zika virus infection.
PG  - e1904
LID - 10.7717/peerj.1904 [doi]
AB  - Background. An international spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has attracted 
      global attention. ZIKV is conveyed by a mosquito vector, Aedes species, which
      also acts as the vector species of dengue and chikungunya viruses. Methods.
      Arrival time of ZIKV importation (i.e., the time at which the first imported case
      was diagnosed) in each imported country was collected from publicly available
      data sources. Employing a survival analysis model in which the hazard is an
      inverse function of the effective distance as informed by the airline
      transportation network data, and using dengue and chikungunya virus transmission 
      data, risks of importation and local transmission were estimated. Results. A
      total of 78 countries with imported case(s) have been identified, with the
      arrival time ranging from 1 to 44 weeks since the first ZIKV was identified in
      Brazil, 2015. Whereas the risk of importation was well explained by the airline
      transportation network data, the risk of local transmission appeared to be best
      captured by additionally accounting for the presence of dengue and chikungunya
      viruses. Discussion. The risk of importation may be high given continued global
      travel of mildly infected travelers but, considering that the public health
      concerns over ZIKV infection stems from microcephaly, it is more important to
      focus on the risk of local and widespread transmission that could involve
      pregnant women. The predicted risk of local transmission was frequently seen in
      tropical and subtropical countries with dengue or chikungunya epidemic
      experience.

TI  - Evidence of new species for malaria vector Anopheles nuneztovari sensu lato in
      the Brazilian Amazon region.
PG  - 205
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1217-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles nuneztovari sensu lato comprises cryptic species in
      northern South America, and the Brazilian populations encompass distinct genetic 
      lineages within the Brazilian Amazon region. This study investigated, based on
      two molecular markers, whether these lineages might actually deserve species
      status. METHODS: Specimens were collected in five localities of the Brazilian
      Amazon, including Manaus, Careiro Castanho and Autazes, in the State of Amazonas;
      Tucurui, in the State of Para; and Abacate da Pedreira, in the State of Amapa,
      and analysed for the COI gene (Barcode region) and 12 microsatellite loci.
      Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the maximum likelihood (ML) approach. 
      Intra and inter samples genetic diversity were estimated using population
      genetics analyses, and the genetic groups were identified by means of the ML,
      Bayesian and factorial correspondence analyses and the Bayesian analysis of
      population structure. RESULTS: The Barcode region dataset (N = 103) generated 27 
      haplotypes. The haplotype network suggested three lineages. The ML tree retrieved
      five monophyletic groups. Group I clustered all specimens from Manaus and Careiro
      Castanho, the majority of Autazes and a few from Abacate da Pedreira. Group II
      clustered most of the specimens from Abacate da Pedreira and a few from Autazes
      and Tucurui. Group III clustered only specimens from Tucurui (lineage III),
      strongly supported (97 %). Groups IV and V clustered specimens of A. nuneztovari 
      s.s. and A. dunhami, strongly (98 %) and weakly (70 %) supported, respectively.
      In the second phylogenetic analysis, the sequences from GenBank, identified as A.
      goeldii, clustered to groups I and II, but not to group III. Genetic distances
      (Kimura-2 parameters) among the groups ranged from 1.60 % (between I and II) to
      2.32 % (between I and III). Microsatellite data revealed very high
      intra-population genetic variability. Genetic distances showed the highest and
      significant values (P = 0.005) between Tucurui and all the other samples, and
      between Abacate da Pedreira and all the other samples. Genetic distances,
      Bayesian (Structure and BAPS) analyses and FCA suggested three distinct
      biological groups, supporting the barcode region results. CONCLUSIONS: The two
      markers revealed three genetic lineages for A. nuneztovari s.l. in the Brazilian 
      Amazon region. Lineages I and II may represent genetically distinct groups or
      species within A. goeldii. Lineage III may represent a new species, distinct from
      the A. goeldii group, and may be the most ancestral in the Brazilian Amazon. They
      may have differences in Plasmodium susceptibility and should therefore be
      investigated further.

AB  - Since its discovery in 1947 in Uganda and control and eradication efforts have
      aimed at its vectors (Aedes mosquitoes) in Latin America in the 1950s, an
      absolute neglect of Zika programs and interventions has been documented in Aedes 
      endemic and epidemic-prone countries. The current unprecedented Zika viral
      epidemics and rapid spread in the Western hemisphere pose a substantial global
      threat, with associated anxiety and consequences. The lack of safe and effective 
      drugs and vaccines against Zika or dengue epidemics further buttresses the
      realization from the West Africa Ebola outbreak that most emerging disease-prone 
      countries are still poorly prepared for an emergency response. This paper
      examines knowledge gaps in both emerging and neglected arthropod-borne flavivirus
      infectious diseases associated with poverty and their implications for fostering 
      local, national and regional emerging disease preparedness, effective and robust 
      surveillance-response systems, sustained control and eventual elimination.
      Strengthening the regional and Global Health Flavivirus Surveillance-Response
      Network (GHFV-SRN) with other models of socio-economic, climatic, environmental
      and ecological mitigation and adaptation strategies will be necessary to improve 
      evidence-based national and global maternal-child health agenda and action plans.

TI  - Risk Associated with the Release of Wolbachia-Infected Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes
      into the Environment in an Effort to Control Dengue.
PG  - 43
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2016.00043 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In an effort to eliminate dengue, a successful technology was
      developed with the stable introduction of the obligate intracellular bacteria
      Wolbachia pipientis into the mosquito Aedes aegypti to reduce its ability to
      transmit dengue fever due to life shortening and inhibition of viral replication 
      effects. An analysis of risk was required before considering release of the
      modified mosquito into the environment. METHODS: Expert knowledge and a risk
      assessment framework were used to identify risk associated with the release of
      the modified mosquito. Individual and group expert elicitation was performed to
      identify potential hazards. A Bayesian network (BN) was developed to capture the 
      relationship between hazards and the likelihood of events occurring. Risk was
      calculated from the expert likelihood estimates populating the BN and the
      consequence estimates elicited from experts. RESULTS: The risk model for "Don't
      Achieve Release" provided an estimated 46% likelihood that the release would not 
      occur by a nominated time but generated an overall risk rating of very low. The
      ability to obtain compliance had the greatest influence on the likelihood of
      release occurring. The risk model for "Cause More Harm" provided a 12.5%
      likelihood that more harm would result from the release, but the overall risk was
      considered negligible. The efficacy of mosquito management had the most
      influence, with the perception that the threat of dengue fever had been
      eliminated, resulting in less household mosquito control, and was scored as the
      highest ranked individual hazard (albeit low risk). CONCLUSIONS: The risk
      analysis was designed to incorporate the interacting complexity of hazards that
      may affect the release of the technology into the environment. The risk analysis 
      was a small, but important, implementation phase in the success of this
      innovative research introducing a new technology to combat dengue transmission in
      the environment.

AB  - The Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN) assembled
      high-profile leaders from global health organisations and vaccine manufactures
      for its 16th Annual General Meeting to work towards a common goal: providing
      quality vaccines for all people. Vaccines contribute to a healthy community and
      robust health system; the Ebola outbreak has raised awareness of the threat and
      damage one single infectious disease can make, and it is clear that the world was
      not prepared. However, more research to better understand emerging infectious
      agents might lead to suitable vaccines which help prevent future outbreaks. DCVMN
      members presented their progress in developing novel vaccines against Dengue,
      HPV, Chikungunya, Cholera, cell-based influenza and other vaccines, demonstrating
      the commitment towards eliminating and eradicating preventable diseases worldwide
      through global collaboration and technology transfer. The successful introduction
      of novel Sabin-IPV and Oral Cholera vaccine in China and Korea respectively in
      2015 was highlighted. In order to achieve global immunisation, local authorities 
      and community leaders play an important role in the decision-making in vaccine
      introduction and uptake, based on the ability of vaccines to protect vaccinated
      people and protect non-vaccinated in the community through herd immunity.
      Reducing the risk of vaccine shortages can also be achieved by increasing
      regulatory convergence at regional and international levels. Combatting
      preventable diseases remains challenging, and collective efforts for improving
      multi-centre clinical trials, creating regional vaccine security strategies,
      fostering developing vaccine markets and procurement, and building trust in
      vaccines were discussed.

LID - 10.1128/JVI.00103-16 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Virus entry into cells is a multistep process that often requires the
      subversion of subcellular machineries. A more complete understanding of these
      steps is necessary to develop new antiviral strategies. While studying the
      potential role of the actin network and one of its master regulators, the small
      GTPase Cdc42, during Junin virus (JUNV) entry, we serendipitously uncovered the
      small molecule ZCL278, reported to inhibit Cdc42 function as an entry inhibitor
      for JUNV and for vesicular stomatitis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, 
      and dengue virus but not for the nonenveloped poliovirus. Although ZCL278 did not
      interfere with JUNV attachment to the cell surface or virus particle
      internalization into host cells, it prevented the release of JUNV
      ribonucleoprotein cores into the cytosol and decreased pH-mediated viral fusion
      with host membranes. We also identified SVG-A astroglial cell-derived cells to be
      highly permissive for JUNV infection and generated new cell lines expressing
      fluorescently tagged Rab5c or Rab7a or lacking Cdc42 using clustered regularly
      interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-caspase 9 (Cas9) gene-editing
      strategies. Aided by these tools, we uncovered that perturbations in the actin
      cytoskeleton or Cdc42 activity minimally affect JUNV entry, suggesting that the
      inhibitory effect of ZCL278 is not mediated by ZCL278 interfering with the
      activity of Cdc42. Instead, ZCL278 appears to redistribute viral particles from
      endosomal to lysosomal compartments. ZCL278 also inhibited JUNV replication in a 
      mouse model, and no toxicity was detected. Together, our data suggest the
      unexpected antiviral activity of ZCL278 and highlight its potential for use in
      the development of valuable new tools to study the intracellular trafficking of
      pathogens. IMPORTANCE: The Junin virus is responsible for outbreaks of Argentine 
      hemorrhagic fever in South America, where 5 million people are at risk. Limited
      options are currently available to treat infections by Junin virus or other
      viruses of the Arenaviridae, making the identification of additional tools,
      including small-molecule inhibitors, of great importance. How Junin virus enters 
      cells is not yet fully understood. Here we describe new cell culture models in
      which the cells are susceptible to Junin virus infection and to which we applied 
      CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering strategies to help characterize early steps during
      virus entry. We also uncovered ZCL278 to be a new antiviral small molecule that
      potently inhibits the cellular entry of the Junin virus and other enveloped
      viruses. Moreover, we show that ZCL278 also functions in vivo, thereby preventing
      Junin virus replication in a mouse model, opening the possibility for the
      discovery of ZCL278 derivatives of therapeutic potential.

TI  - The Spread of Dengue in an Endemic Urban Milieu--The Case of Delhi, India.
PG  - e0146539
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0146539 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a major international public health concern, one of the
      most important arthropod-borne diseases. More than 3.5 billion people are at risk
      of dengue infection and there are an estimated 390 million dengue infections
      annually. This prolific increase has been connected to societal changes such as
      population growth and increasing urbanization generating intense agglomeration
      leading to proliferation of synanthropic mosquito species. Quantifying the
      spatio-temporal epidemiology of dengue in large cities within the context of a
      Geographic Information System is a first step in the identification of
      socio-economic risk factors. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This Project has
      been approved by the ethical committee of Institut Pasteur. Data has been
      anonymized and de-identified prior to geolocalisation and analysis. A GIS was
      developed for Delhi, enabling typological characterization of the urban
      environment. Dengue cases identified in the Delhi surveillance system from 2008
      to 2010 were collated, localised and embedded within this GIS. The
      spatio-temporal distribution of dengue cases and extent of clustering were
      analyzed. Increasing distance from the forest in Delhi reduced the risk of
      occurrence of a dengue case. Proximity to a hospital did not increase risk of a
      notified dengue case. Overall, there was high heterogeneity in incidence rate
      within areas with the same socio-economical profiles and substantial inter-annual
      variability. Dengue affected the poorest areas with high density of humans, but
      rich areas were also found to be infected, potentially because of their central
      location with respect to the daily mobility network of Delhi. Dengue cases were
      highly clustered in space and there was a strong relationship between the time of
      introduction of the virus and subsequent cluster size. At a larger scale, earlier
      introduction predicted the total number of cases. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: DENV 
      epidemiology within Delhi has a forest fire signature. The stochastic nature of
      this invasion process likely smothers any detectable socio-economic risk factors.
      However, the significant finding that the size of the dengue case cluster depends
      on the timing of its emergence emphasizes the need for early case detection and
      implementation of effective mosquito control. A better understanding of the role 
      of population mobility in contributing to dengue risk could also help focus
      control on areas at particular risk of dengue virus importation.

TI  - Artificial Neural Network Analysis of Pharmacokinetic and Toxicity Properties of 
      Lead Molecules for Dengue Fever, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
PG  - 52-61
AB  - Poor pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles are major reasons for the low rate of 
      advancing lead drug candidates into efficacy studies. The In-silico prediction of
      primary pharmacokinetic and toxicity properties in the drug discovery and
      development process can be used as guidance in the design of candidates.
      In-silico parameters can also be used to choose suitable compounds for in-vivo
      testing thereby reducing the number of animals used in experiments. At the
      Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, a data set has been curated from
      in-house measurements in the disease areas of Dengue, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
      Volume of distribution, half-life, total in-vivo clearance, in-vitro human plasma
      protein binding and in-vivo oral bioavailability have been measured for molecules
      in the lead optimization stage in each of these three disease areas. Data for the
      inhibition of the hERG channel using the radio ligand binding dofetilide assay
      was determined for a set of 300 molecules in these therapeutic areas. Based on
      this data, Artificial Neural Networks were used to construct In-silico models for
      each of the properties listed above that can be used to prioritize candidates for
      lead optimization and to assist in selecting promising molecules for in-vivo
      pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - Defining acute kidney injury in dengue viral infection by conventional and novel 
      classification systems (AKIN and RIFLE): a comparative analysis.
PG  - 78-86
LID - 10.1136/postgradmedj-2015-133582 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several criteria have been used to stratify acute kidney injury (AKI)
      in dengue infection and have resulted in variations in its incidence as well as
      clinic-laboratory characteristics. The current study was aimed to compare three
      commonly used criteria of AKI among patients with dengue. METHODS: 667 patients
      with dengue were defined and staged according to the conventional definition
      (CD), the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) and the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss 
      of function, End stage renal disease (RIFLE) criteria. Appropriate statistical
      methods were used to compare these three criteria. RESULTS: The incidence of AKI 
      during dengue infection was 14.2% by AKIN criteria, 12.6% by RIFLE criteria and
      4.2% by CD. AKIN and RIFLE criteria were comparable while AKIN-I identified 11
      more patients with AKI than RIFLE-R (76.8% vs. 73.8%, p=0.023). CD was found to
      be less sensitive than AKIN and RIFLE due to stratification of only severe AKI
      cases with serum creatinine >/=176.8 micromol/L. Overall mortality was 1.2% and
      severe stages of AKI were associated with increased mortality (p<0.001). AKIN
      criteria identified seven risk factors, RIFLE identified six and CD identified
      three risk factors. Old age, severe dengue and the use of nephrotoxic drugs were 
      found to be independent predictors identified by all criteria while hypertension 
      was only identified by AKIN. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AKI in dengue
      infection, the risk factors for its development and clinico-laboratory
      characteristics vary significantly according to the diagnostic criteria used. In 
      our analysis, AKIN and RIFLE were comparable to each other and superior to CD
      with regard to early diagnosis and sensitivity.

TI  - Development of viable TAP-tagged dengue virus for investigation of host-virus
      interactions in viral replication.
PG  - 646-658
LID - 10.1099/jgv.0.000371 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for
      life-threatening dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS).
      The viral replication machinery containing the core non-structural protein 5
      (NS5) is implicated in severe dengue symptoms but molecular details remain
      obscure. To date, studies seeking to catalogue and characterize interaction
      networks between viral NS5 and host proteins have been limited to the yeast
      two-hybrid system, computational prediction and co-immunoprecipitation (IP) of
      ectopically expressed NS5. However, these traditional approaches do not reproduce
      a natural course of infection in which a number of DENV NS proteins colocalize
      and tightly associate during the replication process. Here, we demonstrate the
      development of a recombinant DENV that harbours a TAP tag in NS5 to study
      host-virus interactions in vivo. We show that our engineered DENV was infective
      in several human cell lines and that the tags were stable over multiple viral
      passages, suggesting negligible structural and functional disturbance of NS5. We 
      further provide proof-of-concept for the use of rationally tagged virus by
      revealing a high confidence NS5 interaction network in human hepatic cells. Our
      analysis uncovered previously unrecognized hnRNP complexes and several
      low-abundance fatty acid metabolism genes, which have been implicated in the
      viral life cycle. This study sets a new standard for investigation of
      host-flavivirus interactions.

TI  - Aedes aegypti has spatially structured and seasonally stable populations in
      Yogyakarta, Indonesia.
PG  - 610
LID - 10.1186/s13071-015-1230-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever, the most prevalent global arboviral disease, represents
      an important public health problem in Indonesia. Control of dengue relies on the 
      control of its main vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti, yet nothing is known
      about the population history and genetic structure of this insect in Indonesia.
      Our aim was to assess the spatio-temporal population genetic structure of Ae.
      aegypti in Yogyakarta, a densely populated region on Java with common dengue
      outbreaks. METHODS: We used multiple marker systems (microsatellites, nuclear and
      mitochondrial genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms generated via
      Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing) to analyze 979 Ae. aegypti
      individuals collected from the Yogyakarta city and the surrounding hamlets during
      the wet season in 2011 and the following dry season in 2012. We employed
      individual- and group-based approaches for inferring genetic structure. RESULTS: 
      We found that Ae. aegypti in Yogyakarta has spatially structured and seasonally
      stable populations. The spatial structuring was significant for the nuclear and
      mitochondrial markers, while the temporal structuring was non-significant.
      Nuclear markers identified three main genetic clusters, showing that hamlets have
      greater genetic isolation from each other and from the inner city sites. However,
      one hamlet experienced unrestricted mosquito interbreeding with the inner city,
      forming a single genetic cluster. Genetic distance was poorly correlated with the
      spatial distance among mosquito samples, suggesting stronger influence of
      human-assisted gene flow than active mosquito movement on spatial genetic
      structure. A star-shaped mitochondrial haplotype network and a significant R(2)
      test statistic (R(2) = 0.0187, P = 0.001) support the hypothesis that Ae. aegypti
      in Yogyakarta originated from a small or homogeneous source and has undergone a
      relatively recent demographic expansion. CONCLUSION: We report the first insights
      into the spatio-temporal genetic structure and the underlying processes in the
      dengue fever mosquito from Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Our results provide valuable
      information on the effectiveness of local control measures as well as guidelines 
      for the implementation of novel biocontrol strategies such as release of
      Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.

TI  - A prospective case-control study to investigate retinal microvascular changes in 
      acute dengue infection.
PG  - 17183
LID - 10.1038/srep17183 [doi]
AB  - Dengue infection can affect the microcirculation by direct viral infection or
      activation of inflammation. We aimed to determine whether measured retinal
      vascular parameters were associated with acute dengue infection. Patients with
      acute dengue were recruited from Communicable Diseases Center, Singapore and
      age-gender-ethnicity matched healthy controls were selected from a
      population-based study. Retinal photographs were taken on recruitment and
      convalescence. A spectrum of quantitative retinal microvascular parameters
      (retinal vascular caliber, fractal dimension, tortuosity and branching angle) was
      measured using a semi-automated computer-based program. (Singapore I Vessel
      Assessment, version 3.0). We included 62 dengue patients and 127 controls. Dengue
      cases were more likely to have wider retinal arteriolar and venular calibers
      (158.3 mum vs 144.3 mum, p < 0.001; 227.7 mum vs 212.8 mum, p < 0.001;
      respectively), higher arteriolar and venular fractal dimensions (1.271 vs 1.249, 
      p = 0.002; 1.268 vs. 1.230, p < 0.001, respectively), higher arteriolar and
      venular tortuosity (0.730 vs 0.546 [x10(4)], p < 0.001; 0.849 vs 0.658 [x10(4)], 
      p < 0.001; respectively), compared to controls. Resolution of acute dengue
      coincided with decrease in retinal vascular calibers and venular fractal
      dimension. Dengue patients have altered microvascular network in the retina;
      these changes may reflect pathophysiological processes in the immune system.

AB  - Viral protein homeostasis depends entirely on the machinery of the infected cell.
      Accordingly, viruses can illuminate the interplay between cellular proteostasis
      components and their distinct substrates. Here, we define how the Hsp70 chaperone
      network mediates the dengue virus life cycle. Cytosolic Hsp70 isoforms are
      required at distinct steps of the viral cycle, including entry, RNA replication, 
      and virion biogenesis. Hsp70 function at each step is specified by nine distinct 
      DNAJ cofactors. Of these, DnaJB11 relocalizes to virus-induced replication
      complexes to promote RNA synthesis, while DnaJB6 associates with capsid protein
      and facilitates virion biogenesis. Importantly, an allosteric Hsp70 inhibitor,
      JG40, potently blocks infection of different dengue serotypes in human primary
      blood cells without eliciting viral resistance or exerting toxicity to the host
      cells. JG40 also blocks replication of other medically-important flaviviruses
      including yellow fever, West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Thus,
      targeting host Hsp70 subnetworks provides a path for broad-spectrum antivirals.

TI  - New and Common Haplotypes Shape Genetic Diversity in Asian Tiger Mosquito
      Populations from Costa Rica and Panama.
PG  - 761-8
LID - 10.1093/jee/tou028 [doi]
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae), is a
      vector of several human pathogens. Ae. albopictus is also an invasive species
      that, over recent years, has expanded its range out of its native Asia. Ae.
      albopictus was suspected to be present in Central America since the 1990s, and
      its presence was confirmed by most Central American nations by 2010. Recently,
      this species has been regularly found, yet in low numbers, in limited areas of
      Panama and Costa Rica (CR). Here, we report that short sequences ( approximately 
      558 bp) of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and NADH
      dehydrogenase subunit 5 genes of Ae. albopictus, had no haplotype diversity.
      Instead, there was a common haplotype for each gene in both CR and Panama. In
      contrast, a long COI sequence ( approximately 1,390 bp) revealed that haplotype
      diversity (+/-SD) was relatively high in CR (0.72+/-0.04) when compared with
      Panama (0.33+/-0.13), below the global estimate for reported samples
      (0.89+/-0.01). The long COI sequence allowed us to identify seven (five new)
      haplotypes in CR and two (one new) in Panama. A haplotype network for the long
      COI gene sequence showed that samples from CR and Panama belong to a single large
      group. The long COI gene sequences suggest that haplotypes in Panama and CR,
      although similar to each other, had a significant geographic differentiation
      (Kst=1.33; P<0.001). Thus, most of our results suggest a recent range expansion
      in CR and Panama.

TI  - Dengue Vaccines: A Perspective from the Point of View of Intellectual Property.
PG  - 9454-74
LID - 10.3390/ijerph120809454 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a serious infectious disease and a growing public health problem in
      many tropical and sub-tropical countries. To control this neglected tropical
      disease (NTD), vaccines are likely to be the most cost-effective solution. This
      study analyzed dengue vaccines from both a historical and longitudinal
      perspective by using patent data, evaluating the geographic and time coverage of 
      innovations, the primary patent holders, the network of cooperation and
      partnership for vaccine research and development (R &amp;amp; D), the flow of
      knowledge and the technological domain involved. This study can be seen as an
      example of the use of patent information to inform policy discussions, strategic 
      research planning, and technology transfer. The results show that 93% of patents 
      were granted since 2000, the majority belonging to the United States and Europe, 
      although the share of patents from developing countries has increased. Unlike
      another NTDs, there is great participation of private companies in R &amp;amp; D 
      of dengue vaccines and partnerships and collaboration between public and private 
      companies. Finally, in this study, the main holders showed high knowledge
      absorption and generated capabilities. Therefore, this issue suggests that to
      overcome the difficulty of translational R &amp;amp; D it is necessary to
      stimulate the generation of knowledge and relevant scientific research, to enable
      the productive sector to have the capacity to absorb knowledge, to turn it into
      innovation, and to articulate partnerships and collaboration.

TI  - Unravelling the patterns of host immune responses in Plasmodium vivax malaria and
      dengue co-infection.
PG  - 315
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0835-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concurrent malaria and dengue infection is frequently diagnosed in
      endemic countries, but its immunopathology remains largely unknown. In the
      present study, a large panel of cytokines/chemokines and clinical laboratory
      markers were measured in patients with Plasmodium vivax and dengue co-infection
      as well as in individuals with malaria or dengue mono-infections in order to
      identify biosignatures of each clinical condition. METHODS: Individuals from the 
      Brazilian Amazon were recruited between 2009 and 2013 and classified in three
      groups: vivax malaria (n = 52), dengue (n = 30) and vivax malaria and dengue
      co-infection (n = 30). P. vivax malaria was diagnosed by thick blood smear and
      confirmed by PCR; dengue cases were detected by IgM ELISA or NS1 protein. The
      plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines were determined by multiplex assay.
      RESULTS: Individuals with malaria and dengue co-infection displayed lower levels 
      of platelets and haemoglobin than those with malaria or dengue mono-infections (p
      = 0.0047 and p = 0.0001, respectively). The group of individuals co-infected
      exhibited the highest median concentrations of IFN-gamma, IL-6, CCL4 than the
      mono-infected groups. Network analyses of plasma cytokines/chemokines revealed
      that malaria and dengue co-infection exhibits a distinct immune profile with
      critical roles for TNF, IL-6 and IFN-gamma. Further, parasitaemia levels
      displayed positive significant interactions with IL-6, CCL4 and IL-10 in the
      group of patients co-infected with malaria and dengue. No differences were
      observed in distribution of dengue virus serotypes and Plasmodium parasitaemia
      levels between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings described here identify
      unique patterns of circulating immunological markers in cases of malaria and
      dengue co-infection and provide insights on the immunopathology of this co-morbid
      condition.

TI  - NMR and MD Studies Reveal That the Isolated Dengue NS3 Protease Is an
      Intrinsically Disordered Chymotrypsin Fold Which Absolutely Requests NS2B for
      Correct Folding and Functional Dynamics.
PG  - e0134823
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0134823 [doi]
AB  - Dengue genome encodes a two component protease complex (NS2B-NS3pro) essential
      for the viral maturation/infectivity, thus representing a key drug target.
      Previously, due to its "complete insolubility", the isolated NS3pro could not be 
      experimentally studied and it remains elusive what structure it adopts without
      NS2B and why NS2B is indispensable. Here as facilitated by our previous
      discovery, the isolated NS3pro has been surprisingly deciphered by NMR to be the 
      first intrinsically-disordered chymotrypsin-like fold, which exists in a
      loosely-packed state with non-native long-range interactions as revealed by
      paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE). The disordered NS3pro appears to be
      needed for binding a human host factor to trigger the membrane remodeling.
      Moreover, we have in vitro refolded the NS3pro in complex with either NS2B
      (48-100) or the full-length NS2B (1-130) anchored into the LMPC micelle, and the 
      two complexes have similar activities but different dynamics. We also performed
      molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the results revealed that NS2B shows the 
      highest structural fluctuations in the complex, thus providing the dynamic basis 
      for the observation on its conformational exchange between open and closed
      states. Remarkably, the NS2B cofactor plays a central role in maintaining the
      correlated motion network required for the catalysis as we previously decoded for
      the SARS 3CL protease. Indeed, a truncated NS2B (48-100;Delta77-84) with the
      flexible loop deleted is able to trap the NS2B-NS3pro complex in a highly dynamic
      and catalytically-impotent state. Taken together, our study implies potential
      strategies to perturb the NS2B-NS3pro interface for design of inhibitors for
      treating dengue infection.

TI  - Prototype early warning systems for vector-borne diseases in Europe.
PG  - 6333-51
LID - 10.3390/ijerph120606333 [doi]
AB  - Globalization and environmental change, social and demographic determinants and
      health system capacity are significant drivers of infectious diseases which can
      also act as epidemic precursors. Thus, monitoring changes in these drivers can
      help anticipate, or even forecast, an upsurge of infectious diseases. The
      European Environment and Epidemiology (E3) Network has been built for this
      purpose and applied to three early warning case studies: (1) The environmental
      suitability of malaria transmission in Greece was mapped in order to target
      epidemiological and entomological surveillance and vector control activities.
      Malaria transmission in these areas was interrupted in 2013 through such
      integrated preparedness and response activities. (2) Since 2010, recurrent West
      Nile fever outbreaks have ensued in South/eastern Europe. Temperature deviations 
      from a thirty year average proved to be associated with the 2010 outbreak.
      Drivers of subsequent outbreaks were computed through multivariate logistic
      regression models and included monthly temperature anomalies for July and a
      normalized water index. (3) Dengue is a tropical disease but sustained
      transmission has recently emerged in Madeira. Autochthonous transmission has also
      occurred repeatedly in France and in Croatia mainly due to travel importation.
      The risk of dengue importation into Europe in 2010 was computed with the volume
      of international travelers from dengue affected areas worldwide.These prototype
      early warning systems indicate that monitoring drivers of infectious diseases can
      help predict vector-borne disease threats.

TI  - Human-Mediated Marine Dispersal Influences the Population Structure of Aedes
      aegypti in the Philippine Archipelago.
PG  - e0003829
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003829 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) is an extraordinary health burden on global
      scale, but still lacks effective vaccine. The Philippines is endemic for dengue
      fever, but massive employment of insecticides favored the development of
      resistance mutations in its major vector, Aedes aegypti. Alternative vector
      control strategies consist in releasing artificially modified mosquitos in the
      wild, but knowledge on their dispersal ability is necessary for a successful
      implementation. Despite being documented that Ae. aegypti can be passively
      transported for long distances, no study to date has been aimed at understanding 
      whether human marine transportation can substantially shape the migration
      patterns of this mosquito. With thousands of islands connected by a dense network
      of ships, the Philippines is an ideal environment to fill this knowledge gap.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Larvae of Ae. aegypti from 15 seaports in seven
      major islands of central-western Philippines were collected and genotyped at
      seven microsatellite loci. Low genetic structure and considerable gene flow was
      found in the area. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses suggested that
      anthropic factors (specifically the amount of processed cargo and human
      population density) can explain the observed population structure, while
      geographical distance was not correlated. Interestingly, cargo shipments seem to 
      be more efficient than passenger ships in transporting Ae. aegypti. Bayesian
      clustering confirmed that Ae. aegypti from busy ports are more genetically
      similar, while populations from idle ports are relatively structured, regardless 
      of the geographical distance that separates them. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The
      results confirmed the pivotal role of marine human-mediated long-range dispersal 
      in determining the population structure of Ae. aegypti. Hopefully corroborated by
      further research, the present findings could assist the design of more effective 
      vector control strategies.

TI  - Differential diagnosis of illness in travelers arriving from Sierra Leone,
      Liberia, or Guinea: a cross-sectional study from the GeoSentinel Surveillance
      Network.
PG  - 757-64
LID - 10.7326/M15-0074 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The largest-ever outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD), ongoing in
      West Africa since late 2013, has led to export of cases to Europe and North
      America. Clinicians encountering ill travelers arriving from countries with
      widespread Ebola virus transmission must be aware of alternate diagnoses
      associated with fever and other nonspecific symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To define the
      spectrum of illness observed in persons returning from areas of West Africa where
      EVD transmission has been widespread. DESIGN: Descriptive, using GeoSentinel
      records. SETTING: 57 travel or tropical medicine clinics in 25 countries.
      PATIENTS: 805 ill returned travelers and new immigrants from Sierra Leone,
      Liberia, or Guinea seen between September 2009 and August 2014. MEASUREMENTS:
      Frequencies of demographic and travel-related characteristics and illnesses
      reported. RESULTS: The most common specific diagnosis among 770 nonimmigrant
      travelers was malaria (n = 310 [40.3%]), with Plasmodium falciparum or severe
      malaria in 267 (86%) and non-P. falciparum malaria in 43 (14%). Acute diarrhea
      was the second most common diagnosis among nonimmigrant travelers (n = 95
      [12.3%]). Such common diagnoses as upper respiratory tract infection, urinary
      tract infection, and influenza-like illness occurred in only 26, 9, and 7
      returning travelers, respectively. Few instances of typhoid fever (n = 8), acute 
      HIV infection (n = 5), and dengue (n = 2) were encountered. LIMITATION:
      Surveillance data collected by specialist clinics may not be representative of
      all ill returned travelers. CONCLUSION: Although EVD may currently drive clinical
      evaluation of ill travelers arriving from Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea,
      clinicians must be aware of other more common, potentially fatal diseases.
      Malaria remains a common diagnosis among travelers seen at GeoSentinel sites.
      Prompt exclusion of malaria and other life-threatening conditions is critical to 
      limiting morbidity and mortality. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention.

TI  - International external quality control assessment for the serological diagnosis
      of dengue infections.
PG  - 167
LID - 10.1186/s12879-015-0877-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is endemic to the tropics and subtropics, and the most
      frequent of arthropod-borne viral diseases. Reliable diagnosis of dengue
      infection is important not only in clinical care but also in disease
      surveillance, the control of outbreaks, and the development of new vaccines. The 
      diagnosis of dengue infection is usually established by a variety of commercial
      or in-house serological protocols. The European Network for the Diagnostics of
      Imported Viral Diseases (ENIVD) recognized the need to survey the accuracy of
      dengue serological diagnostics in current use, and organized an external quality 
      assurance (EQA) study of dengue serological practice in diagnostic laboratories. 
      METHODS: A 15-sample panel, consisting of sera reactive against dengue plus
      specificity and negative controls, was sent to 48 laboratories for serological
      testing. The results returned by the participating laboratories were anonymized, 
      scored, and subjected to comparison and statistical analysis. RESULTS: Ten
      laboratories rated all samples correctly with regard to IgM, and only three
      achieved the full score for IgG detection. The main handicaps in assay
      performance were suboptimal sensitivity of in-house IgM detection protocols by
      comparison with better-performing commercial ELISA tests, and the presence of IgG
      cross-reactivity with heterologous flaviviruses. Differences of detail in the
      methodology of dengue IgG antibody detection appear to underlie the disparities
      in accuracy observed between laboratories. CONCLUSION: This EQA study
      demonstrates that there is room for many laboratories to improve sensitivity in
      the detection of anti-dengue virus IgM antibodies, against the benchmark set by
      commercial antibody capture ELISA tests. The EQA shows also that cross-reactivity
      is a continuing issue, and IgG detection protocols must be optimized to increase 
      their specificity.

      (ASEAN): overview and update.
PG  - e0003575
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003575 [doi]
AB  - The ten member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
      constitute an economic powerhouse, yet these countries also harbor a mostly
      hidden burden of poverty and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Almost 200
      million people live in extreme poverty in ASEAN countries, mostly in the low or
      lower middle-income countries of Indonesia, the Philippines, Myanmar, Viet Nam,
      and Cambodia, and many of them are affected by at least one NTD. However, NTDs
      are prevalent even among upper middle-income ASEAN countries such as Malaysia and
      Thailand, especially among the indigenous populations. The three major intestinal
      helminth infections are the most common NTDs; each helminthiasis is associated
      with approximately 100 million infections in the region. In addition, more than
      10 million people suffer from either liver or intestinal fluke infections, as
      well as schistosomiasis and lymphatic filariasis (LF). Intestinal protozoan
      infections are widespread, while leishmaniasis has emerged in Thailand, and
      zoonotic malaria (Plasmodium knowlesi infection) causes severe morbidity in
      Malaysia. Melioidosis has emerged as an important bacterial NTD, as have selected
      rickettsial infections, and leptospirosis. Leprosy, yaws, and trachoma are still 
      endemic in focal areas. Almost 70 million cases of dengue fever occur annually in
      ASEAN countries, such that this arboviral infection is now one of the most common
      and economically important NTDs in the region. A number of other arboviral and
      zoonotic viral infections have also emerged, including Japanese encephalitis;
      tick-borne viral infections; Nipah virus, a zoonosis present in fruit bats; and
      enterovirus 71 infection. There are urgent needs to expand surveillance
      activities in ASEAN countries, as well as to ensure mass drug administration is
      provided to populations at risk for intestinal helminth and fluke infections, LF,
      trachoma, and yaws. An ASEAN Network for Drugs, Diagnostics, Vaccines, and
      Traditional Medicines Innovation provides a policy framework for the development 
      of new control and elimination tools. Together with prominent research
      institutions and universities, the World Health Organization (WHO), and its
      regional offices, these organizations could implement important public health
      improvements through NTD control and elimination in the coming decade.

      the virus life cycle makes it an attractive target for antiviral drug discovery. 
      The N-terminal region of NS3 and its cofactor NS2B constitute the protease that
      cleaves the viral polyprotein. The NS3 C-terminal domain possesses RNA helicase, 
      nucleoside and RNA triphosphatase activities and is involved both in viral RNA
      replication and virus particle formation. In addition, NS2B-NS3 serves as a hub
      for the assembly of the flavivirus replication complex and also modulates viral
      pathogenesis and the host immune response. Here, we review biochemical and
      structural advances on the NS2B-NS3 protein, including the network of
      interactions it forms with NS5 and NS4B and highlight recent drug development
      efforts targeting this protein. This article forms part of a symposium in
      Antiviral Research on flavivirus drug discovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes viral haemorrhagic fever that is
      characterized by extensive activation of the immune system. The aim of this study
      is to investigate the kinetics of the transcriptome signature changes during the 
      course of disease and the association of genes in these signatures with clinical 
      parameters. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Sequential whole blood samples from
      DENV infected patients in Jakarta were profiled using affymetrix microarrays,
      which were analysed using principal component analysis, limma, gene set analysis,
      and weighted gene co-expression network analysis. We show that time since onset
      of disease, but not diagnosis, has a large impact on the blood transcriptome of
      patients with non-severe dengue. Clinical diagnosis (according to the WHO
      classification) does not associate with differential gene expression. Network
      analysis however, indicated that the clinical markers platelet count, fibrinogen,
      albumin, IV fluid distributed per day and liver enzymes SGOT and SGPT strongly
      correlate with gene modules that are enriched for genes involved in the immune
      response. Overall, we see a shift in the transcriptome from immunity and
      inflammation to repair and recovery during the course of a DENV infection.
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Time since onset of disease associates with the shift
      in transcriptome signatures from immunity and inflammation to cell cycle and
      repair mechanisms in patients with non-severe dengue. The strong association of
      time with blood transcriptome changes hampers both the discovery as well as the
      potential application of biomarkers in dengue. However, we identified gene
      expression modules that associate with key clinical parameters of dengue that
      reflect the systemic activity of disease during the course of infection. The
      expression level of these gene modules may support earlier detection of disease
      progression as well as clinical management of dengue.

AB  - The Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers' Network (DCVMN) held its
      fifteenth annual meeting from October 27-29, 2014, New Delhi, India. The DCVMN,
      together with the co-organizing institution Panacea Biotec, welcomed over 240
      delegates representing high-profile governmental and nongovernmental global
      health organizations from 36 countries. Over the three-day meeting, attendees
      exchanged information about their efforts to achieve their shared goal of
      preventing death and disability from known and emerging infectious diseases.
      Special praise was extended to all stakeholders involved in the success of polio 
      eradication in South East Asia and highlighted challenges in vaccine supply for
      measles-rubella immunization over the coming decades. Innovative vaccines and
      vaccine delivery technologies indicated creative solutions for achieving global
      immunization goals. Discussions were focused on three major themes including
      regulatory challenges for developing countries that may be overcome with better
      communication; global collaborations and partnerships for leveraging investments 
      and enable uninterrupted supply of affordable and suitable vaccines; and leading 
      innovation in vaccines difficult to develop, such as dengue, Chikungunya,
      typhoid-conjugated and EV71, and needle-free technologies that may speed up
      vaccine delivery. Moving further into the Decade of Vaccines, participants
      renewed their commitment to shared responsibility toward a world free of
      vaccine-preventable diseases.

      Lutzomyia anduzei (Diptera, Psychodidae) from the Brazilian Amazon.

AB  - Lutzomyia (Nyssomyia) anduzei has been recognized as a secondary vector of
      Leishmania guyanensis in the Brazilian Amazon region. Since L. anduzei is
      anthropophilic, co-exists in areas of high leishmaniasis transmission and has
      been found infected with L. guyanensis, the understanding of the vector
      population structure and of the process responsible for it is paramount to the
      vector management and control efforts. In this study we analyzed 74 and 67
      sequences of the COI and Cytb loci, respectively, from mitochondrial DNA, aiming 
      to estimate the intra-population genetic variability and population structure in 
      six L. anduzei samples from the Brazilian Amazon region. For COI, we found 58
      haplotypes, low to high (FST=0.0310-0.4128) and significant (P=0.0033) genetic
      structure, and reduced gene flow among populations. The haplotype network yielded
      many reticulations that likely resulted from hypervariability in the locus. For
      Cytb, we observed 27 haplotypes, low to moderate (FST=0.0077-0.1954) and
      nonsignificant (P>0.05) genetic structure for the majority of comparisons and
      extensive gene flow among populations, in line with the haplotypes network data. 
      AMOVA analysis indicated that most of the variation occurred within populations
      (83.41%, 90.94%); nevertheless, there were significant differences
      (PhiST=0.0906-0.1659; P=0.00098; P=0.00000) among them for both loci. The Mantel 
      test showed that the genetic structure is not associated to an
      isolation-by-distance (IBD) model in either of both loci. These data suggest that
      L. anduzei is genetically very diverse. The genetic structure lacking IBD may be 
      due to adaptation to local habitats and the low dispersal capacity of the
      sandflies, and both could lead to population fragmentation and geographic
      isolation. These findings have important implications for epidemiology,
      surveillance and vector control and may be a first step in understanding the
      evolutionary history of this species.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases cause significant public health burden and are widely
      re-emerging or emerging. Understanding, predicting, and mitigating the spread of 
      mosquito-borne disease in diverse populations and geographies are ongoing
      modelling challenges. We propose a hybrid network-patch model for the spread of
      mosquito-borne pathogens that accounts for individual movement through mosquito
      habitats, extending the capabilities of existing agent-based models (ABMs) to
      include vector-borne diseases. The ABM are coupled with differential equations
      representing 'clouds' of mosquitoes in patches accounting for mosquito ecology.
      We adapted an ABM for humans using this method and investigated the importance of
      heterogeneity in pathogen spread, motivating the utility of models of individual 
      behaviour. We observed that the final epidemic size is greater in patch models
      with a high risk patch frequently visited than in a homogeneous model. Our hybrid
      model quantifies the importance of the heterogeneity in the spread of
      mosquito-borne pathogens, guiding mitigation strategies.

AB  - The chikungunya epidemic in the Dominican Republic began in February 2014. During
      the first six months 429 421 cases were recorded, representing 65% of all those
      notified to the Pan American Health Organization by 33 countries and territories 
      of the Region of the Americas. This epidemic has spread quickly in the Dominican 
      Republic, requiring a focused intersectoral response, led by the Ministry of
      Public Health and involving major efforts by the National Epidemiological System 
      and the health services network. Given that the virus will affect thousands of
      people, this article seeks to describe the actions that have already been carried
      out, and to share the results and lessons learned during these first months with 
      health ministries and professionals in the countries of the Region, in order to
      assist them to prepare an appropriate response to confront the epidemic
      effectively and efficiently.

TI  - DenguePredict: An Integrated Drug Repositioning Approach towards Drug Discovery
      for Dengue.
PG  - 1279-88
AB  - Dengue is a viral disease of expanding global incidence without cures. Here we
      present a drug repositioning system (DenguePredict) leveraging upon a unique drug
      treatment database and vast amounts of disease- and drug-related data. We first
      constructed a large-scale genetic disease network with enriched dengue genetics
      data curated from biomedical literature. We applied a network-based ranking
      algorithm to find dengue-related diseases from the disease network. We then
      developed a novel algorithm to prioritize FDA-approved drugs from dengue-related 
      diseases to treat dengue. When tested in a de-novo validation setting,
      DenguePredict found the only two drugs tested in clinical trials for treating
      dengue and ranked them highly: chloroquine ranked at top 0.96% and ivermectin at 
      top 22.75%. We showed that drugs targeting immune systems and arachidonic acid
      metabolism-related apoptotic pathways might represent innovative drugs to treat
      dengue. In summary, DenguePredict, by combining comprehensive disease- and
      drug-related data and novel algorithms, may greatly facilitate drug discovery for
      dengue.

TI  - CPB1 of Aedes aegypti interacts with DENV2 E protein and regulates intracellular 
      viral accumulation and release from midgut cells.
PG  - 5028-46
LID - 10.3390/v6125028 [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti is a principal vector responsible for the transmission of dengue
      viruses (DENV). To date, vector control remains the key option for dengue disease
      management. To develop new vector control strategies, a more comprehensive
      understanding of the biological interactions between DENV and Ae. aegypti is
      required. In this study, a cDNA library derived from the midgut of female adult
      Ae. aegypti was used in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screenings against DENV2 envelope 
      (E) protein. Among the many interacting proteins identified, carboxypeptidase B1 
      (CPB1) was selected, and its biological interaction with E protein in Ae. aegypti
      primary midgut cells was further validated. Our double immunofluorescent assay
      showed that CPB1-E interaction occurred in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the 
      Ae. aegypti primary midgut cells. Overexpression of CPB1 in mosquito cells
      resulted in intracellular DENV2 genomic RNA or virus particle accumulation, with 
      a lower amount of virus release. Therefore, we postulated that in Ae. aegypti
      midgut cells, CPB1 binds to the E protein deposited on the ER intraluminal
      membranes and inhibits DENV2 RNA encapsulation, thus inhibiting budding from the 
      ER, and may interfere with immature virus transportation to the trans-Golgi
      network.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: It has been well recognized that microRNA plays a role in the
      host-pathogen interaction network. The significance of microRNA in the regulation
      of dengue virus (DENV) replication, however, remains unknown. The objective of
      our study was to determine the biological function of miR-548g-3p in modulating
      the replication of dengue virus. METHODS: Here we report that employment of a
      microRNA target search algorithm to analyze the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR)
      consensus sequences of DENV (DENV serotypes 1-4) led to a discovery that
      miR-548g-3p directly targets the stem loop A promoter element within the 5'UTR, a
      region essential for DENV replication. Real-time PCR was used to measure the
      expression levels of miR-548g-3p under DENV infection. We performed
      overexpression and inhibition assays to test the role of miR-548g-3p on DENV
      replication. The protein and mRNA levels of interferon were measured by ELISA and
      real-time PCR respectively. RESULT: We found that overexpression of miR-548g-3p
      suppressed multiplication of DENV 1, 2, 3 and 4, and that miR-548g-3p was also
      found to interfere with DENV translation, thereby suppressing the expression of
      viral proteins. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that miR-548g-3p directly
      regulates DENV replication and warrant further study to investigate the
      feasibility of microRNA-based anti-DENV approaches.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The need to control dengue transmission by means of insecticides
      has led to the development of resistance to most of the products used worldwide
      against mosquitoes. In the State of Sao Paulo, the Superintendencia de Controle
      de Endemias (SUCEN) has annually monitored the susceptibility of Aedes aegypti to
      insecticides since 1996; since 1999, surveys were conducted in collaboration with
      the National Network of Laboratories (MoReNAa Network) and were coordinated by
      the Ministry of Health. In this study, in addition to the biological
      characterization of insecticide resistance in the laboratory, the impact of
      resistance on field control was evaluated for vector populations that showed
      resistance in laboratory assays. METHODS: Field efficacy tests with larvicides
      and adulticides were performed over a 13-year period, using World Health
      Organization protocols. RESULTS: Data from the field tests showed a reduction in 
      the residual effect of temephos on populations with a resistance ratio of 3. For 
      adults, field control was less effective in populations characterized as
      resistant in laboratory qualitative assays, and this was confirmed using
      qualitative assays and field evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that 
      management of resistance development needs to be adopted when insect populations 
      show reduced susceptibility. The use of insecticides is a self-limiting tool that
      needs to be applied cautiously, and dengue control requires more sustainable
      strategies.

AB  - Dengue virus can ignite both protective and pathogenic responses in human. The
      pathogenesis is related with modified functioning of our immune system during
      infection. Pattern recognition receptors like Toll like receptor 3 is vital for
      the induction of innate immunity in case of Dengue infection. Toll like receptor 
      3 induces TRIF mediated activation of Type 1 interferons and Fc receptor mediated
      induction of cytokines. Interferons have been related with clearance of Dengue
      virus but it has adopted modified regulatory mechanisms to counter this effect.
      SOCS protein is also induced due to the interferon and cytokine mediated
      signalling which can subsequently play its part in the regulation of interferon
      and cytokine production. Our hypothesis in this study relates the pathogenesis of
      Dengue virus with the SOCS mediated inhibition of our innate immunity. We used
      the qualitative formalism of Rene Thomas to model the biological regulatory
      network of Toll like receptor 3 mediated signalling pathway in an association
      with pathogenesis of dengue. Logical parameters for the qualitative modelling
      were inferred using a model checking approach implemented in SMBioNet. A linear
      hybrid model, parametric linear hybrid automaton, was constructed to incorporate 
      the activation and inhibition time delays in the qualitative model. The
      qualitative model captured all the possible expression dynamics of the proteins
      in the form of paths, some of which were observed as abstract cycles
      (representing homoeostasis) and diverging paths towards stable states. The
      analysis of the qualitative model highlighted the importance of SOCS protein in
      elevating propagation of dengue virus through inhibition of type 1 interferons.
      Detailed qualitative analysis of regulatory network endorses our hypothesis that 
      elevated levels of cytokine subsequently induce SOCS expression which in turn
      results into the continuous down-regulation of Toll like receptor 3 and
      interferon. This may result into the Dengue pathogenesis during the stage of
      immunosuppression. Further analysis with HyTech (HYbrid TECHnology) tool provided
      us with the real-time constraints (delay constraints) of the proteins involved in
      the cyclic paths of the regulatory network backing the evidence provided by the
      qualitative analysis. The HyTech results also suggest that the role of SOCS is
      vital in homoeostasis.

AB  - Protein conformation has been recognized as the key feature determining
      biological function, as it determines the position of the essential groups
      specifically interacting with substrates. Hence, the shape of the cavities or
      grooves at the protein surface appears to drive those functions. However, only a 
      few studies describe the geometrical evolution of protein cavities during
      molecular dynamics simulations (MD), usually with a crude representation. To
      unveil the dynamics of cavity geometry evolution, we developed an approach
      combining cavity detection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This approach 
      was applied to four systems subjected to MD (lysozyme, sperm whale myoglobin,
      Dengue envelope protein and EF-CaM complex). PCA on cavities allows us to perform
      efficient analysis and classification of the geometry diversity explored by a
      cavity. Additionally, it reveals correlations between the evolutions of the
      cavities and structures, and can even suggest how to modify the protein
      conformation to induce a given cavity geometry. It also helps to perform fast and
      consensual clustering of conformations according to cavity geometry. Finally,
      using this approach, we show that both carbon monoxide (CO) location and transfer
      among the different xenon sites of myoglobin are correlated with few cavity
      evolution modes of high amplitude. This correlation illustrates the link between 
      ligand diffusion and the dynamic network of internal cavities.

TI  - Sensing of immature particles produced by dengue virus infected cells induces an 
      antiviral response by plasmacytoid dendritic cells.
PG  - e1004434
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004434 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the leading cause of mosquito-borne viral illness and
      death in humans. Like many viruses, DENV has evolved potent mechanisms that
      abolish the antiviral response within infected cells. Nevertheless, several in
      vivo studies have demonstrated a key role of the innate immune response in
      controlling DENV infection and disease progression. Here, we report that sensing 
      of DENV infected cells by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) triggers a robust
      TLR7-dependent production of IFNalpha, concomitant with additional antiviral
      responses, including inflammatory cytokine secretion and pDC maturation. We
      demonstrate that unlike the efficient cell-free transmission of viral
      infectivity, pDC activation depends on cell-to-cell contact, a feature observed
      for various cell types and primary cells infected by DENV, as well as West Nile
      virus, another member of the Flavivirus genus. We show that the sensing of DENV
      infected cells by pDCs requires viral envelope protein-dependent secretion and
      transmission of viral RNA. Consistently with the cell-to-cell sensing-dependent
      pDC activation, we found that DENV structural components are clustered at the
      interface between pDCs and infected cells. The actin cytoskeleton is pivotal for 
      both this clustering at the contacts and pDC activation, suggesting that this
      structural network likely contributes to the transmission of viral components to 
      the pDCs. Due to an evolutionarily conserved suboptimal cleavage of the precursor
      membrane protein (prM), DENV infected cells release uncleaved prM
      containing-immature particles, which are deficient for membrane fusion function. 
      We demonstrate that cells releasing immature particles trigger pDC IFN response
      more potently than cells producing fusion-competent mature virus. Altogether, our
      results imply that immature particles, as a carrier to endolysosome-localized
      TLR7 sensor, may contribute to regulate the progression of dengue disease by
      eliciting a strong innate response.

AB  - Commercially available diagnostic test kits for detection of dengue virus (DENV) 
      non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and anti-DENV IgM were evaluated for their
      sensitivity and specificity and other performance characteristics by a diagnostic
      laboratory network developed by World Health Organization (WHO), the
      UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in
      Tropical Diseases (TDR) and the Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative (PDVI). Each 
      network laboratory contributed characterized serum specimens for the panels used 
      in the evaluation. Microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and rapid
      diagnostic test (RDT formats) were represented by the kits. Each ELISA was
      evaluated by 2 laboratories and RDTs were evaluated by at least 3 laboratories.
      The reference tests for IgM anti-DENV were laboratory developed assays produced
      by the Armed Forces Research Institute for Medical Science (AFRIMS) and the
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the NS1 reference test was 
      reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results were analyzed
      to determine sensitivity, specificity, inter-laboratory and inter-reader
      agreement, lot-to-lot variation and ease-of-use. NS1 ELISA sensitivity was 60-75%
      and specificity 71-80%; NS1 RDT sensitivity was 38-71% and specificity 76-80%;
      the IgM anti-DENV RDTs sensitivity was 30-96%, with a specificity of 86-92%, and 
      IgM anti-DENV ELISA sensitivity was 96-98% and specificity 78-91%. NS1 tests were
      generally more sensitive in specimens from the acute phase of dengue and in
      primary DENV infection, whereas IgM anti-DENV tests were less sensitive in
      secondary DENV infections. The reproducibility of the NS1 RDTs ranged from 92-99%
      and the IgM anti-DENV RDTs from 88-94%.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a public health problem that presents complexity in its
      dissemination. The physical means of spreading and the dynamics of the spread
      between municipalities need to be analyzed to guide effective public policies to 
      combat this problem. METHODS: This study uses timing varying graph methods (TVG) 
      to construct a correlation network between occurrences of reported cases of
      dengue between cities in the state of Bahia-Brazil. The topological network
      indices of all cities were correlated with dengue incidence using Spearman
      correlation. A randomization test was used to estimate the significance value of 
      the correlation. RESULTS: The correlation network presented a complex behavior
      with a heavy-tail distribution of the network edges weight. The randomization
      test exhibit a significant correlation (P < 0.0001) between the degree of each
      municipality in the network and the incidence of dengue in each municipality.
      CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis of the existence of a correlation between the
      occurrences of reported cases of dengue between different municipalities in the
      state of Bahia was validated. The significant correlation between the node degree
      and incidence, indicates that municipalities with high incidence are also
      responsible for the spread of the disease in the state. The method proposed
      suggests a new tool in epidemiological control strategy.

AB  - Dengue fever with its subtle rash is today more common than malaria in travellers
      returning to Europe from the tropics (meta-analysis Geo Sentinel network). Up to 
      5 % of all safari tourists experience African tick bite fever during or soon
      after their journey; it is caused by rickettsiae and clinically presents with
      exanthems, focal necrotizing vasculitis (eschar, tache noir), lymphadenopathy and
      moderate fever. Typhoid fever is a severe infectious disease is which is
      difficult to diagnosis at first assessment. The presence of rose spots, which may
      be found in up to 33 % of patients with typhoid fever, can lead the way to
      diagnosis. Exanthems can be subtle and may occur weeks after infection without
      any other distinctive clinical sign. Particular importance in travel medicine has
      to be paid to acute HIV infection and secondary syphilis after exposition and
      infection in the tropics. Also the highly contagious infectious diseases of
      childhood as measles and rubeola have to be taken into account in adults with no 
      or insufficient vaccination after a stay in tropical countries.

TI  - Comparative host feeding patterns of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, 
      in urban and suburban Northeastern USA and implications for disease transmission.
PG  - e3037
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes albopictus is an invasive species which continues expanding its
      geographic range and involvement in mosquito-borne diseases such as chikungunya
      and dengue. Host selection patterns by invasive mosquitoes are critically
      important because they increase endemic disease transmission and drive outbreaks 
      of exotic pathogens. Traditionally, Ae. albopictus has been characterized as an
      opportunistic feeder, primarily feeding on mammalian hosts but occasionally
      acquiring blood from avian sources as well. However, limited information is
      available on their feeding patterns in temperate regions of their expanded range.
      Because of the increasing expansion and abundance of Ae. albopictus and the
      escalating diagnoses of exotic pathogens in travelers returning from endemic
      areas, we investigated the host feeding patterns of this species in newly invaded
      areas to further shed light on its role in disease ecology and assess the public 
      health threat of an exotic arbovirus outbreak. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We
      identified the vertebrate source of 165 blood meals in Ae. albopictus collected
      between 2008 and 2011 from urban and suburban areas in northeastern USA. We used 
      a network of Biogents Sentinel traps, which enhance Ae. albopictus capture
      counts, to conduct our collections of blooded mosquitoes. We also analyzed
      blooded Culex mosquitoes collected alongside Ae. albopictus in order to examine
      the composition of the community of blood sources. We found no evidence of bias
      since as expected Culex blood meals were predominantly from birds (n = 149,
      93.7%) with only a small proportion feeding on mammals (n = 10, 6.3%). In
      contrast, Aedes albopictus fed exclusively on mammalian hosts with over 90% of
      their blood meals derived from humans (n = 96, 58.2%) and domesticated pets (n = 
      38, 23.0% cats; and n = 24, 14.6% dogs). Aedes albopictus fed from humans
      significantly more often in suburban than in urban areas (chi(2), p = 0.004) and 
      cat-derived blood meals were greater in urban habitats (chi(2), p = 0.022).
      Avian-derived blood meals were not detected in any of the Ae. albopictus tested. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The high mammalian affinity of Ae. albopictus suggests 
      that this species will be an efficient vector of mammal- and human-driven
      zoonoses such as La Crosse, dengue, and chikungunya viruses. The lack of blood
      meals obtained from birds by Ae. albopictus suggest that this species may have
      limited exposure to endemic avian zoonoses such as St. Louis encephalitis and
      West Nile virus, which already circulate in the USA. However, growing populations
      of Ae. albopictus in major metropolitan urban and suburban centers, make a large 
      autochthonous outbreak of an arbovirus such as chikungunya or dengue viruses a
      clear and present danger. Given the difficulties of Ae. albopictus suppression,
      we recommend that public health practitioners and policy makers install proactive
      measures for the imminent mitigation of an exotic pathogen outbreak.

PG  - 2668-2676
LID - 10.1099/vir.0.068544-0 [doi]
AB  - Based on the hypothesis that interactions between virions and serum components
      may influence the outcome of dengue virus (DENV) infections, we decided to use
      affinity chromatography with domain III from the envelope (E) protein of DENV2
      (DIIIE2) as a ligand to isolate virus-binding proteins from human plasma. This
      approach yielded serum amyloid P (SAP) and alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M) as
      novel viral interactors. After confirming the specific binding of both SAP and
      alpha2M to DIIIE2 by ELISA, the latter interaction was examined in greater
      detail. We obtain evidence suggesting that the binding species was actually the
      receptor-activated form of alpha2M (alpha2M*), that alpha2M* could bind
      monovalently to recombinant domain III from all four DENV serotypes with
      affinities in the micromolar range ranking as DENV4>DENV1~DENV2>DENV3 and that
      this interaction exhibited a strong avidity effect when multivalent binding was
      favoured (KD 8 x 10(-8) M for DIIIE2). We also showed that alpha2M* bound to DENV
      virions of the four serotypes, protecting the virus from temperature-induced
      inactivation in the absence of serum and enhancing infectivity. The latter effect
      exhibited an ED50 of 2.9 x 10(-8) M, also suggesting an avidity effect due to
      multivalent binding. These results will further contribute to the
      characterization of the virus-host factor interaction network during human DENV
      infection.

TI  - Epidemic cycles driven by host behaviour.
LID - 10.1098/rsif.2014.0575 [doi]
LID - 20140575 [pii]
AB  - Host immunity and demographics (the recruitment of susceptibles via birthrate)
      have been demonstrated to be a key determinant of the periodicity of measles,
      pertussis and dengue epidemics. However, not all epidemic cycles are from
      pathogens inducing sterilizing immunity or are driven by demographics. Many
      sexually transmitted infections are driven by sexual behaviour. We present a
      mathematical model of disease transmission where individuals can disconnect and
      reconnect depending on the infectious status of their contacts. We fit the model 
      to historic syphilis (Treponema pallidum) and gonorrhea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae)
      incidence in the USA and explore potential intervention strategies against
      syphilis. We find that cycles in syphilis incidence can be driven solely by
      changing sexual behaviour in structured populations. Our model also explains the 
      lack of similar cycles in gonorrhea incidence even if the two infections share
      the same propagation pathways. Our model similarly illustrates how sudden
      epidemic outbreaks can occur on time scales smaller than the characteristic
      demographic time scale of the population and that weaker infections can lead to
      more violent outbreaks. Behaviour also appears to be critical for control
      strategies as we found a bigger sensitivity to behavioural interventions than
      antibiotic treatment. Thus, behavioural interventions may play a larger role than
      previously thought, especially in the face of antibiotic resistance and low
      intervention efficacies.

TI  - Travel-acquired infections and illnesses in Canadians: surveillance report from
      CanTravNet surveillance data, 2009-2011.
PG  - e20-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Important knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of migration
      medicine practice and the impact of pathogens imported by Canadian travellers. We
      present here a comprehensive, Canada-specific surveillance summary of illness in 
      a cohort of returned Canadian travellers and new immigrants. METHODS: We
      extracted and analyzed (using standard parametric and nonparametric techniques)
      data from the Canadian Travel Medicine Network (CanTravNet) database for ill
      returned Canadian travellers and new immigrants who presented to a Canadian
      GeoSentinel Surveillance Network site between September 2009 and September 2011. 
      RESULTS: During the study period, 4365 travellers and immigrants presented to a
      CanTravNet site, 3943 (90.3%) of whom were assigned a travel-related diagnosis.
      Among the 3115 non-immigrant travellers with a definitive travel-related
      diagnosis, arthropod bite (n = 127 [4.1%]), giardiasis (n = 91 [2.9%]), malaria
      (n = 77 [2.5%]), latent tuberculosis (n = 73 [2.3%]), and strongyloidiasis (n =
      66 [2.1%]) were the most common specific etiologic diagnoses. Among the 828
      immigrants with definitive travel-related diagnoses, the most frequent etiologies
      were latent tuberculosis (n = 229 [27.7%]), chronic hepatitis B (n = 182
      [22.0%]), active tuberculosis (n = 97 [11.7%]), chronic hepatitis C (n = 89
      [10.7%]), and strongyloidiasis (n = 41 [5.0%]). Potentially serious infections,
      such as dengue fever (61 cases) and enteric fever due to Salmonella enterica
      serotype Typhi or Paratyphi (36 cases), were common. Individuals travelling for
      the purpose of visiting friends and relatives (n = 500 [11.6% of those with known
      reason for travel]) were over-represented among those diagnosed with malaria and 
      enteric fever, compared with other illnesses (for malaria 34/94 [36.2%] v.
      466/4221 [11.0%]; for enteric fever, 17/36 [47.2%] v. 483/4279 [11.3%]) (both p <
      0.001). For cases of malaria, there was also overrepresentation (compared with
      other illnesses) from business travellers (22/94 [23.4%] v. 337/4221 [8.0%]) and 
      males (62/94 [66.0%] v. 1964/4269 [46.0%]) (both p < 0.001). Malaria was more
      likely than other illnesses to be acquired in sub-Saharan Africa (p < 0.001),
      whereas dengue was more likely than other illnesses to be imported from the
      Caribbean and South East Asia (both p = 0.003) and enteric fever from South
      Central Asia (24/36 [66.7%]) (p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: This analysis of
      surveillance data on ill returned Canadian travellers has detailed the spectrum
      of imported illness within this cohort. It provides an epidemiologic framework
      for Canadian practitioners encountering ill returned travellers. We have
      confirmed that travel to visit friends and relatives confers particularly high
      risks, which underscores the need to improve pretravel intervention for a
      population that is unlikely to seek specific pretravel advice. Potentially
      serious and fatal illnesses such as malaria and enteric fever were common, as
      were illnesses of public health importance, such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B.

TI  - Towards a Hybrid Agent-based Model for Mosquito Borne Disease.
LID - 10 [pii]
AB  - Agent-based models (ABM) are used to simulate the spread of infectious disease
      through a population. Detailed human movement, demography, realistic business
      location networks, and in-host disease progression are available in existing
      ABMs, such as the Epidemic Simulation System (EpiSimS). These capabilities make
      possible the exploration of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical mitigation
      strategies used to inform the public health community. There is a similar need
      for the spread of mosquito borne pathogens due to the re-emergence of diseases
      such as chikungunya and dengue fever. A network-patch model for mosquito dynamics
      has been coupled with EpiSimS. Mosquitoes are represented as a "patch" or "cloud"
      associated with a location. Each patch has an ordinary differential equation
      (ODE) mosquito dynamics model and mosquito related parameters relevant to the
      location characteristics. Activities at each location can have different levels
      of potential exposure to mosquitoes based on whether they are inside, outside, or
      somewhere in-between. As a proof of concept, the hybrid network-patch model is
      used to simulate the spread of chikungunya through Washington, DC. Results are
      shown for a base case, followed by varying the probability of transmission,
      mosquito count, and activity exposure. We use visualization to understand the
      pattern of disease spread.

TI  - Multiple resistances and complex mechanisms of Anopheles sinensis mosquito: a
      major obstacle to mosquito-borne diseases control and elimination in China.
PG  - e2889
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002889 [doi]
AB  - Malaria, dengue fever, and filariasis are three of the most common mosquito-borne
      diseases worldwide. Malaria and lymphatic filariasis can occur as concomitant
      human infections while also sharing common mosquito vectors. The overall
      prevalence and health significance of malaria and filariasis have made them top
      priorities for global elimination and control programmes. Pyrethroid resistance
      in anopheline mosquito vectors represents a highly significant problem to malaria
      control worldwide. Several methods have been proposed to mitigate insecticide
      resistance, including rotational use of insecticides with different modes of
      action. Anopheles sinensis, an important malaria and filariasis vector in
      Southeast Asia, represents an interesting mosquito species for examining the
      consequences of long-term insecticide rotation use on resistance. We examined
      insecticide resistance in two An. Sinensis populations from central and southern 
      China against pyrethroids, organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates,
      which are the major classes of insecticides recommended for indoor residual
      spray. We found that the mosquito populations were highly resistant to the four
      classes of insecticides. High frequency of kdr mutation was revealed in the
      central population, whereas no kdr mutation was detected in the southern
      population. The frequency of G119S mutation in the ace-1 gene was moderate in
      both populations. The classification and regression trees (CART) statistical
      analysis found that metabolic detoxification was the most important resistance
      mechanism, whereas target site insensitivity of L1014 kdr mutation played a less 
      important role. Our results indicate that metabolic detoxification was the
      dominant mechanism of resistance compared to target site insensitivity, and
      suggests that long-term rotational use of various insecticides has led An.
      sinensis to evolve a high insecticide resistance. This study highlights the
      complex network of mechanisms conferring multiple resistances to chemical
      insecticides in mosquito vectors and it has important implication for designing
      and implementing vector resistance management strategies.

AB  - Aedes aegypti has played a major role in the dramatic expansion of dengue
      worldwide. The failure of control programs in reducing the rhythm of global
      dengue expansion through vector control suggests the need for studies to support 
      more appropriated control strategies. We report here the results of a
      longitudinal study on Ae. aegypti population dynamics through continuous egg
      sampling aiming to characterize the infestation of urban areas of a Brazilian
      oceanic island, Fernando de Noronha. The spatial and temporal distribution of the
      dengue vector population in urban areas of the island was described using a
      monitoring system (SMCP-Aedes) based on a 103-trap network for Aedes egg
      sampling, using GIS and spatial statistics analysis tools. Mean egg densities
      were estimated over a 29-month period starting in 2011 and producing monthly maps
      of mosquito abundance. The system detected continuous Ae. aegypti oviposition in 
      most traps. The high global positive ovitrap index (POI=83.7% of 2815 events)
      indicated the frequent presence of blood-fed-egg laying females at every sampling
      station. Egg density (eggs/ovitrap/month) reached peak values of 297.3 (0 - 2020)
      in May and 295 (0 - 2140) in August 2012. The presence of a stable Ae. aegypti
      population established throughout the inhabited areas of the island was
      demonstrated. A strong association between egg abundance and rainfall with a
      2-month lag was observed, which combined with a first-order autocorrelation
      observed in the series of egg counts can provide an important forecasting tool.
      This first description of the characteristics of the island infestation by the
      dengue vector provides baseline information to analyze relationships between the 
      spatial distribution of the vector and dengue cases, and to the development of
      integrated vector control strategies.

AB  - Although dengue has been a public health problem for several decades in the Lao
      People's Democratic Republic, the magnitude of the disease burden and
      epidemiological trends remain poorly understood. We analysed national dengue
      surveillance and laboratory data from 2006 to 2012 by person, place and time.
      Between 2006 and 2012, the annual dengue notification rate ranged between 62 and 
      367 cases per 100 000 population with an apparent geographical expansion of
      transmission throughout the country in recent years and concurrent co-circulation
      of all four dengue virus subtypes. An electronic database, called Lao People's
      Democratic Republic Early Warning Alert and Response Network, was introduced in
      2008 to provide automated early warning for outbreaks and epidemics. Village
      outbreaks continue to be notified primarily through event-based surveillance,
      whereas the weekly indicator-based system provides systematic assessment of
      annual epidemic cycles. The dengue case data indicate a high and increasing
      burden of disease. Efforts now need to focus on using available data to prompt
      more effective outbreak response and to guide the design and implementation of
      intervention strategies.

TI  - Rab18 facilitates dengue virus infection by targeting fatty acid synthase to
      sites of viral replication.
PG  - 6793-804
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00045-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Positive-sense RNA viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), hijack the
      intracellular membrane machinery for their own replication. The Rab18 protein, a 
      member of the Rab GTPase family, key regulators of membrane trafficking, is
      located on the organelles involved in DENV infection, such as the endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LDs). In this study, we addressed the
      potential involvement of Rab18 in DENV infection by using cells overexpressing
      the wild-type, GTP-bound active form, or GDP-bound inactive form of Rab18 and
      cells with Rab18 knockdown. DENV replication, measured by viral protein, viral
      RNA, and viral progeny production, as well as LD induction, was reduced in cells 
      with inactive Rab18 and in cells deprived of Rab18 expression, suggesting a
      positive role of Rab18 in the DENV life cycle. Interestingly, the interaction of 
      fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key lipogenic enzyme in lipid biosynthesis, with
      DENV NS3 protein relied on the conversion of the GDP-bound to the GTP-bound form 
      of Rab18. Furthermore, the targeting of FASN to sites participating in DENV
      infection, such as the ER and LDs, depends on functional Rab18. Thus,
      Rab18-mediated membrane trafficking of FASN and NS3 facilitates DENV replication,
      probably by ensuring a sufficient and coordinated lipid supply for membrane
      proliferation and arrangement. IMPORTANCE: Infection by dengue virus (DENV), an
      important mosquito-borne virus threatening approximately 40% of the world's
      population, can cause mild dengue fever or severe dengue hemorrhagic fever and
      dengue shock syndrome. The pathogenesis mechanisms of DENV-related diseases are
      not clear, but high viral replication is believed to be a risk factor for the
      severe form of DENV infection. Thus, understanding the detailed mechanism of DENV
      replication might help address this devastating virus. Here, we found that Rab18,
      a small GTPase involved in vesicle trafficking and located in the endoplasmic
      reticulum network and on the surfaces of lipid droplets, positively regulates
      DENV replication. The functional machinery of Rab18 is required to recruit the
      enzyme fatty acid synthase to sites of DENV replication and to interact with DENV
      NS3 protein to promote fatty acid biosynthesis. Thus, DENV usurps Rab18 to
      facilitate its own replication.

AB  - We describe travelers who were evaluated pre-travel to Brazil from March 2008
      through July 2010 in the Boston area. Of 599 Brazil travelers, 71%, 58%, and 50% 
      received vaccines for yellow fever (YF), typhoid, and hepatitis A, respectively. 
      Fewer received influenza and hepatitis B vaccines (14%, 11%). A total of 60%
      traveled during Brazil's peak influenza season, and one fourth visited during
      peak dengue transmission. The 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics include events
      throughout Brazil. Travelers should seek pre-travel assessment including YF and
      malaria risk; travelers should be vaccinated against influenza, be up to date on 
      other routine vaccines, and be prepared to protect themselves against mosquitoes.

TI  - High-throughput quantitative proteomic analysis of dengue virus type 2 infected
      A549 cells.
PG  - e93305
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0093305 [doi]
AB  - Disease caused by dengue virus is a global health concern with up to 390 million 
      individuals infected annually worldwide. There are no vaccines or antiviral
      compounds available to either prevent or treat dengue disease which may be fatal.
      To increase our understanding of the interaction of dengue virus with the host
      cell, we analyzed changes in the proteome of human A549 cells in response to
      dengue virus type 2 infection using stable isotope labelling in cell culture
      (SILAC) in combination with high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS). Mock and
      infected A549 cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts
      before analysis to identify proteins that redistribute between cellular
      compartments during infection and reduce the complexity of the analysis. We
      identified and quantified 3098 and 2115 proteins in the cytoplasmic and nuclear
      fractions respectively. Proteins that showed a significant alteration in amount
      during infection were examined using gene enrichment, pathway and network
      analysis tools. The analyses revealed that dengue virus infection modulated the
      amounts of proteins involved in the interferon and unfolded protein responses,
      lipid metabolism and the cell cycle. The SILAC-MS results were validated for a
      select number of proteins over a time course of infection by Western blotting and
      immunofluorescence microscopy. Our study demonstrates for the first time the
      power of SILAC-MS for identifying and quantifying novel changes in cellular
      protein amounts in response to dengue virus infection.

AB  - To understand geographic variation in travel-related illness acquired in distinct
      African regions, we used the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network database to analyze
      records for 16,893 ill travelers returning from Africa over a 14-year period.
      Travelers to northern Africa most commonly reported gastrointestinal illnesses
      and dog bites. Febrile illnesses were more common in travelers returning from
      sub-Saharan countries. Eleven travelers died, 9 of malaria; these deaths occurred
      mainly among male business travelers to sub-Saharan Africa. The profile of
      illness varied substantially by region: malaria predominated in travelers
      returning from Central and Western Africa; schistosomiasis, strongyloidiasis, and
      dengue from Eastern and Western Africa; and loaisis from Central Africa. There
      were few reports of vaccine-preventable infections, HIV infection, and
      tuberculosis. Geographic profiling of illness acquired during travel to Africa
      guides targeted pretravel advice, expedites diagnosis in ill returning travelers,
      and may influence destination choices in tourism.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are very few strategies for the early detection of the
      patients who might develop the severe form of the illness. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate
      the utility of serum levels of some immune response mediators as early biomarkers
      for the severe dengue prognosis during the early phase of the illness. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Using a case-control design nested in a multicenter cohort from the 
      AEDES network (a Colombian multicenter study), we compared TNF a, ST2, TRAIL and 
      IDO levels in samples which were obtained during the early phase of the illness. 
      RESULTS: ST2, TRAIL and TNF a levels were higher in severe dengue patients
      compared with uncomplicated patients (p<0.0001), as follows: OR=24.8, CI95%= 6.1-
      98.0; OR=18.0, CI95%= 4.6-69.1; OR=NC, CI95%= NC, respectively. We did not find
      statistically significant differences between IDO levels in severe dengue and
      uncomplicated dengue (p=1.000, OR=1.0, CI95%= 0.2-6.1). CONCLUSIONS: In the early
      phase of the dengue infection (96 hours), ST2, TRAIL and TNF a quantifications
      could contribute to the prediction of complications of the illness.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Aedes aegypti is the principal vector of dengue in urban areas.
      Despite its epidemiological importance, the genetic variability of Colombian
      populations of this species is unknown. OBJETIVE: To determine the genetic
      variability of mitocondrial gene ND4, which codes for subunit 4 of the enzyme
      NADH deshydrogenase, between populations of Ae. aegypti from municipalities of
      Sincelejo and Guaranda. The incidences of dengue reported from these two
      localities are high and low, respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genetic
      material extracted from 36 females of Ae. aegypti was used to determine the
      partial sequence of the mitocondrial gene ND4 as well as to estimate the
      parameters of nucleotidic and haplotypic diversities, genetic structure and gene 
      flow between the Sincelejo and Guaranda populations. The molecular variance was
      also analysed and a haplotypic network constructed. RESULTS: In all 36 nucleotide
      sequences of 282 pb were obtained. These presented 12 polymorphic sites and could
      grouped into 10 haplotypes, two of them present in both populations, three
      exclusive to the Sincelejo population and five to that of Guaranda. The
      estimators of genetic structure (FST = 0.15) and gene flow (Nm = 1.40) are both
      indicative of genetic differentiation and a limited exchange of genes between the
      populations. CONCLUSIONS: The Sincelejo and Guaranda populations of Ae. aegypti
      are genetically divergent.

TI  - Inhibition of dengue virus replication by a class of small-molecule compounds
      that antagonize dopamine receptor d4 and downstream mitogen-activated protein
      kinase signaling.
PG  - 5533-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00365-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Dengue viruses (DENV) are endemic pathogens of tropical and
      subtropical regions that cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. To 
      date, no vaccines or antiviral therapeutics have been approved for combating
      DENV-associated disease. In this paper, we describe a class of tricyclic
      small-molecule compounds-dihydrodibenzothiepines (DHBTs), identified through
      high-throughput screening-with potent inhibitory activity against DENV serotype
      2. SKI-417616, a highly active representative of this class, displayed activity
      against all four serotypes of DENV, as well as against a related flavivirus, West
      Nile virus (WNV), and an alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SINV). This compound was
      characterized to determine its mechanism of antiviral activity. Investigation of 
      the stage of the viral life cycle affected revealed that an early event in the
      life cycle is inhibited. Due to the structural similarity of the DHBTs to known
      antagonists of the dopamine and serotonin receptors, we explored the roles of two
      of these receptors, serotonin receptor 2A (5HTR2A) and the D4 dopamine receptor
      (DRD4), in DENV infection. Antagonism of DRD4 and subsequent downstream
      phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-related kinase (ERK)
      were found to impact DENV infection negatively, and blockade of signaling through
      this network was confirmed as the mechanism of anti-DENV activity for this class 
      of compounds. IMPORTANCE: The dengue viruses are mosquito-borne, reemerging human
      pathogens that are the etiological agents of a spectrum of febrile diseases.
      Currently, there are no approved therapeutic treatments for dengue-associated
      disease, nor is there a vaccine. This study identifies a small molecule,
      SKI-417616, with potent anti-dengue virus activity. Further analysis revealed
      that SKI-417616 acts through antagonism of the host cell dopamine D4 receptor and
      subsequent repression of the ERK phosphorylation pathway. These results suggest
      that SKI-417616, or other compounds targeting the same cellular pathways, may
      have therapeutic potential for the treatment of dengue virus infections.

TI  - Illness in travelers returned from Brazil: the GeoSentinel experience and
      implications for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.
PG  - 1347-56
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciu122 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brazil will host the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympic and
      Paralympic Games, events that are expected to attract hundreds of thousands of
      international travelers. Travelers to Brazil will encounter locally endemic
      infections as well as mass event-specific risks. METHODS: We describe 1586 ill
      returned travelers who had visited Brazil and were seen at a GeoSentinel Clinic
      from July 1997 through May 2013. RESULTS: The most common travel-related
      illnesses were dermatologic conditions (40%), diarrheal syndromes (25%), and
      febrile systemic illness (19%). The most common specific dermatologic diagnoses
      were cutaneous larva migrans, myiasis, and tungiasis. Dengue and malaria,
      predominantly Plasmodium vivax, were the most frequently identified specific
      causes of fever and the most common reasons for hospitalization after travel.
      Dengue fever diagnoses displayed marked seasonality, although cases were seen
      throughout the year. Among the 28 ill returned travelers with human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 11 had newly diagnosed asymptomatic
      infection and 9 had acute symptomatic HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis primarily
      identified infectious diseases among travelers to Brazil. Knowledge of illness in
      travelers returning from Brazil can assist clinicians to advise prospective
      travelers and guide pretravel preparation, including itinerary-tailored advice,
      vaccines, and chemoprophylaxis; it can also help to focus posttravel evaluation
      of ill returned travelers. Travelers planning to attend mass events will
      encounter other risks that are not captured in our surveillance network.

TI  - The prevalence and endemic nature of dengue infections in Guangdong, South China:
      an epidemiological, serological, and etiological study from 2005-2011.
PG  - e85596
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0085596 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Frequent outbreaks of dengue are considered to be associated with an 
      increased risk for endemicity of the disease. The occurrence of a large number of
      indigenous dengue cases in consecutive years indicates the possibility of a
      changing dengue epidemic pattern in Guangdong, China. METHODS: To have a clear
      understanding of the current dengue epidemic, a retrospective study of
      epidemiological profile, serological response, and virological features of dengue
      infections from 2005-2011 was conducted. Case data were collected from the
      National Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Network. Serum samples were
      collected and prepared for serological verification and etiological confirmation.
      Incidence, temporal and spatial distribution, and the clinical manifestation of
      dengue infections were analyzed. Pearson's Chi-Square test was used to compare
      incidences between different age groups. A seroprevalence survey was implemented 
      in local healthy inhabitants to obtain the overall positive rate for the specific
      immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody against dengue virus (DENV). RESULTS: The overall 
      annual incidence rate was 1.87/100000. A significant difference was found in
      age-specific incidence (Pearson's Chi-Square value 498.008, P<0.001). Children
      under 5 years of age had the lowest incidence of 0.28/100000. The vast majority
      of cases presented with a mild manifestation typical to dengue fever. The overall
      seroprevalence of dengue IgG antibody in local populations was 2.43% (range
      0.28%-5.42%). DENV-1 was the predominant serotype in circulation through the
      years, while all 4 serotypes were identified in indigenous patients from
      different outbreak localities since 2009. CONCLUSIONS: A gradual change in the
      epidemic pattern of dengue infection has been observed in recent years in
      Guangdong. With the endemic nature of dengue infections, the transition from a
      monotypic to a multitypic circulation of dengue virus in the last several years
      will have an important bearing on the prevention and control of dengue in the
      province and in the neighboring districts.

TI  - An evaluation of the surveillance system for dengue virus infections in Maldives.
PG  - 60-68
LID - 10.4103/2224-3151.206886 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is endemic in Maldives. The largest epidemic to date was in
      2011. This study evaluates the surveillance system for dengue during 2011,
      identifies gaps and suggests ways to improve. METHODS: This evaluation of the
      national surveillance system for dengue was done in September to October 2012,
      using an evaluation tool based on United States Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention (US CDC) guidelines, staff involved in surveillance of different
      levels, and doctors expected to notify, were interviewed, and surveillance data
      from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) were compared by use of an independent
      database of the country's national referral hospital in Male, Indira Gandhi
      Memorial Hospital (IGMH), to assess sensitivity and timeliness. RESULTS: National
      surveillance is conducted by HPA, which collects information daily from a network
      of health facilities. Standard case definitions were published, butthey were not 
      easily accessible to clinicians. The quality of data was acceptable. Information 
      is disseminated as annual communicable disease reports to health facilities and
      uploaded onto the official website. The timeliness of reporting was good (median 
      2 days). However, the usefulness for early warning of outbreaks was limited,
      owing to central and peripheral resource limitations. Data were useful for
      planning. Sensitivity was 0.54. Acceptability by clinicians was poor, owing to
      the lack of feedback reaching them. The reporting rate was high from the
      paediatric ward in IGMH (85%), where the responsibility of notifying was also
      assigned to ward in-charge and support staff, but it was extremely low from the
      medical ward (1.7%), where only doctors were given the responsibility.
      CONCLUSION: This evaluation shows the performance of the dengue surveillance
      system was good overall. However, clinicians need more regular feedback. The
      performance could be improved significantly by written protocols, legislature and
      assigning the responsibility of surveillance in hospitals to ward managers in
      addition to doctors.

AB  - Although the murine models have the feasibility to reproduce some signs of dengue
      Virus (DENV) infection, the use of isogenic hosts with polarized immune response 
      patterns does not reproduce the particularities of human disease. Our goal was to
      investigate the kinetics of peripheral blood biomarkers in immunocompetent
      Callithrix penicillata non-human primates subcutaneously infected with DENV-3.
      The viral load of infected animals was determinated by quantitative real time
      PCR. Measurements of DENV-3/IgM were performed, and several parameters were
      assessed by hemogram: red blood cells count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood 
      cells count, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets count. The
      coagulogram was performed by prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial
      thromboplastin time (APTT) assays. The renal function was monitored by urea and
      creatinine, and the liver function by the aspartate (AST), and alanine (ALT)
      aminotransferases. Also, the level of the cytokines IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-2,
      IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-5 was quantified during the experimental study. Data
      analysis was performed considering relevant differences when baseline fold
      changes were found outside from 0.75 to 1.5 range. Our data demonstrated that
      infected animals presented relevant signs of dengue disease, including peaks of
      viremia at 5 days-post-infection (dpi), peaks of anti-DENV-3 IgM at 15 dpi and
      hemaglutination inhibition assay (HIA) from 15 to at 60 dpi. Despite early
      monocytosis, slight neutrophilia and lymphocytosis, animals developed persistent 
      leucopenia starting at 4 dpi. Anemia episodes were steady at 3-4 dpi. Patent
      thrombocytopenia was observed from 1 to 15 dpi with sporadic decrease of APTT. A 
      substantial increase of ALT and AST was observed with higher peak at 4 dpi.
      Moreover, early increases of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma besides late increase of
      IFN-gamma were observed. The analysis of biomarkers network pointed out two
      relevant strong axes during early stages of dengue fever, a protective axes
      TNF-alpha/Lymphocytes/Platelets, and a pathological IL-2/IL-6/Viremia/Monocyte/PT
      bond. Later on, the biomarker network highlighted the interaction
      IFN-gamma/PLT/DENV-3(IgM;HAI)/PT, and the involvement of type-2 cytokines (IL-4; 
      IL-5). Our findings demonstrated that C. penicillata is a feasible experimental
      model for dengue virus infection, which could be useful to pathogenesis studies, 
      discovery of novel antiviral drugs as well as to evaluate vaccine candidates
      against DENV.

AB  - Imported dengue cases pose the public health risk for local circulation in
      European areas, especially southeast France, where the Aedes mosquito is
      established. Using a capture-recapture method with Chao's estimator, we estimated
      the annual incidence of dengue fever and the completeness of existing mandatory
      notification and laboratory network surveillance systems. During 2007-2010,
      >8,300 cases with laboratory evidence of recent dengue infection were diagnosed. 
      Of these cases, 4,500 occurred in 2010, coinciding with intense epidemics in the 
      French West Indies. Over this 4-year period, 327 cases occurred in southeast
      France during the vector activity period. Of these, 234 cases occurred in 2010,
      most of them potentially viremic. Completeness of the mandatory notification and 
      laboratory network systems were approximately 10% and 40%, respectively, but
      higher in southeast areas during May-November (32% and 69%, respectively). Dengue
      surveillance systems in France provide complementary information that is
      essential to the implementation of control measures.

TI  - Prevalence of dengue virus infection in US travelers who have lived in or
      traveled to dengue-endemic countries.
PG  - 352-60
LID - 10.1111/jtm.12057 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) infections may occur in travelers. OBJECTIVES: To
      determine prevalence of anti-DENV IgG antibody in travelers who lived in or
      visited dengue-endemic countries and to describe risk factors and characteristics
      associated with infection and subsequent anti-DENV IgG antibody presence.
      METHODS: Participants were enrolled from travel clinics of the Boston Area Travel
      Medicine Network from August 2008 through June 2009. Demographic information,
      trip duration, travel history, and a blood sample were collected. Serum samples
      were tested for anti-DENV IgG antibody by indirect IgG enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and antibody-mediated virus neutralization by plaque
      reduction neutralization test (PRNT) for anti-DENV IgG antibody-positive and
      selected negative samples. Participants were stratified into group 1: born in
      dengue-endemic countries; group 2: born in nonendemic countries but lived
      continuously for >/=1 year in a dengue-endemic country; group 3: born in
      nonendemic countries and traveled to a dengue-endemic country for >/=2 weeks but 
      <1 year. RESULTS: Six hundred travelers were enrolled. Anti-DENV IgG antibody was
      identified in 113 (19%) when tested by ELISA (51% in group 1, 40% in group 2, and
      6.9% in group 3) and in 71 (12%) by PRNT (42% primary monotypic and 58%
      heterotypic reactive responses). Sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA based
      on PRNT results were 85% to 100% and 79% to 94%, assuming up to 15%
      misclassification of ELISA negative results. Presence of anti-DENV IgG antibody
      by ELISA was associated with years lived in dengue-endemic countries and
      birthplace in the Caribbean for group 1, receipt of Japanese encephalitis vaccine
      in group 3, and self-reported history of dengue in all three groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      Nineteen percent of participants who were born, lived in, or traveled to
      dengue-endemic countries had anti-DENV IgG antibody by ELISA; 12% had antibodies 
      by PRNT, 85% of whom had no history of dengue. Presence of DENV antibodies was
      associated with years lived in dengue-endemic countries and self-reported history
      of dengue.

TI  - Clinical profile of acute kidney injury in a pediatric intensive care unit from
      Southern India: A prospective observational study.
PG  - 207-13
LID - 10.4103/0972-5229.118412 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the term acute renal failure was replaced by acute kidney
      injury (AKI) recently, there is a paucity of data on the incidence and profile of
      AKI in critically ill children from the developing world. OBJECTIVES: The
      objective of this study is to determine the incidence, etiology, short term
      outcome and predictors of fatality in critically ill children admitted to the
      pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with AKI, aged 1 month to 13 years.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, from June 2010 to
      March 2011, 215 children admitted to the PICU were screened for AKI, defined
      according to the AKI Network criteria. The patients with AKI were followed-up
      until discharge/death. Their clinical and biochemical data were recorded.
      RESULTS: The incidence of AKI among 215 patients screened was 54 (25.1%). The
      common etiologies were infections, [34 (62.9%)], acute glomerulonephritis (7.6%),
      snake envenomation (5.7%), hemolytic uremic syndrome (3.8%) and congestive
      cardiac failures (3.8%). Among infections, pneumonia and septicemia constituted
      26.5% each, meningoencephalitis accounted for 23.5%, and dengue, scrub typhus,
      tuberculosis and malaria constituted 9.3% of children with AKI. 27.8% of patients
      required dialysis. Overall mortality was 46.3%. On logistic regression analysis, 
      requirement of mechanical ventilation was an independent predictor of fatality in
      AKI. CONCLUSIONS: Besides the high incidence of AKI in critically ill-children
      admitted to the PICU (25.1%), the condition was associated with adverse outcomes,
      including high mortality (46.3%) and need for dialysis (27.8%). Infections
      dominated the etiological profile. Requirement of mechanical ventilation
      predicted an adverse outcome in our patient population.

TI  - A global airport-based risk model for the spread of dengue infection via the air 
      transport network.
PG  - e72129
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0072129 [doi]
AB  - The number of travel-acquired dengue infections has seen a consistent global rise
      over the past decade. An increased volume of international passenger air traffic 
      originating from regions with endemic dengue has contributed to a rise in the
      number of dengue cases in both areas of endemicity and elsewhere. This paper
      reports results from a network-based risk assessment model which uses
      international passenger travel volumes, travel routes, travel distances, regional
      populations, and predictive species distribution models (for the two vector
      species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) to quantify the relative risk posed 
      by each airport in importing passengers with travel-acquired dengue infections.
      Two risk attributes are evaluated: (i) the risk posed by through traffic at each 
      stopover airport and (ii) the risk posed by incoming travelers to each
      destination airport. The model results prioritize optimal locations (i.e.,
      airports) for targeted dengue surveillance. The model is easily extendible to
      other vector-borne diseases.

AB  - Vector-borne diseases, such as dengue, malaria and chikungunya, are increasing
      across their traditional ranges and continuing to infiltrate new, previously
      unaffected, regions. The spatio-temporal evolution of these diseases is
      determined by the interaction of the host and vector, which is strongly dependent
      on social structures and mobility patterns. We develop an agent-based model
      (ABM), in which each individual is explicitly represented and vector populations 
      are linked to precipitation estimates in a tropical setting. The model is
      implemented on both scale-free and regular networks. The spatio-temporal
      transmission of chikungunya is analysed and the presence of asymptomatic silent
      spreaders within the population is investigated in the context of implementing
      travel restrictions during an outbreak. Preventing the movement of symptomatic
      individuals is found to be an insufficient mechanism to halt the spread of the
      disease, which can be readily carried to neighbouring nodes via sub-clinical
      individuals. Furthermore, the impact of topology structure vs. precipitation
      levels is assessed and precipitation is found to be the dominant factor driving
      spatio-temporal transmission.

AB  - In order to establish the genetic variability of Aedes aegypti determined by the 
      analysis of the MT-ND4 gene, in eleven endemic regions for dengue in Peru, 51
      samples of Ae. Aegypti were tested. The genetic variability was determined
      through the amplification and sequencing of a fragment of 336 base-pairs of MT
      ND4, the analysis of intra-specific phylogeny was conducted with the Network Ver.
      4.6.10 program; and the phylogenetic analysis, with the Neighbor Joining distance
      method. The presence of five haplotypes of Ae. Aegypti grouped in two lineages
      was identified: the first one includes haplotypes 1, 3 and 5, and the second one 
      comprises haplotypes 2 and 4. The geographic distribution of each of the
      haplotypes found is also shown. It is concluded that this variability is caused
      by the active migration of this vector and the human activity-mediated passive
      migration.

TI  - Dried-blood spots: a cost-effective field method for the detection of Chikungunya
      virus circulation in remote areas.
PG  - e2339
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002339 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2005, there were outbreaks of febrile polyarthritis due to
      Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the Comoros Islands. CHIKV then spread to other
      islands in the Indian Ocean: La Reunion, Mauritius, Seychelles and Madagascar.
      These outbreaks revealed the lack of surveillance and preparedness of Madagascar 
      and other countries. Thus, it was decided in 2007 to establish a syndrome-based
      surveillance network to monitor dengue-like illness. OBJECTIVE: This study aims
      to evaluate the use of capillary blood samples blotted on filter papers for
      molecular diagnosis of CHIKV infection. Venous blood samples can be difficult to 
      obtain and the shipment of serum in appropriate temperature conditions is too
      costly for most developing countries. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Venous 
      blood and dried-blood blotted on filter paper (DBFP) were collected during the
      last CHIKV outbreak in Madagascar (2010) and as part of our routine surveillance 
      of dengue-like illness. All samples were tested by real-time RT-PCR and results
      with serum and DBFP samples were compared for each patient. The sensitivity and
      specificity of tests performed with DBFP, relative to those with venous samples
      (defined as 100%) were 93.1% (95% CI:[84.7-97.7]) and 94.4% (95% CI:[88.3-97.7]),
      respectively. The Kappa coefficient 0.87 (95% CI:[0.80-0.94]) was excellent.
      CONCLUSION: This study shows that DBFP specimens can be used as a cost-effective 
      alternative sampling method for the surveillance and monitoring of CHIKV
      circulation and emergence in developing countries, and probably also for other
      arboviruses. The loss of sensitivity is insignificant and involved a very small
      number of patients, all with low viral loads. Whether viruses can be isolated
      from dried blood spots remains to be determined.

TI  - Cell phone-based system (Chaak) for surveillance of immatures of dengue virus
      mosquito vectors.
PG  - 879-89
AB  - Capture of surveillance data on mobile devices and rapid transfer of such data
      from these devices into an electronic database or data management and decision
      support systems promote timely data analyses and public health response during
      disease outbreaks. Mobile data capture is used increasingly for malaria
      surveillance and holds great promise for surveillance of other neglected tropical
      diseases. We focused on mosquito-borne dengue, with the primary aims of: 1)
      developing and field-testing a cell phone-based system (called Chaak) for capture
      of data relating to the surveillance of the mosquito immature stages, and 2)
      assessing, in the dengue endemic setting of Merida, Mexico, the
      cost-effectiveness of this new technology versus paper-based data collection.
      Chaak includes a desktop component, where a manager selects premises to be
      surveyed for mosquito immatures, and a cell phone component, where the surveyor
      receives the assigned tasks and captures the data. Data collected on the cell
      phone can be transferred to a central database through different modes of
      transmission, including near-real time where data are transferred immediately
      (e.g., over the Internet) or by first storing data on the cell phone for future
      transmission. Spatial data are handled in a novel, semantically driven,
      geographic information system. Compared with a pen-and-paper-based method, use of
      Chaak improved the accuracy and increased the speed of data transcription into an
      electronic database. The cost-effectiveness of using the Chaak system will depend
      largely on the up-front cost of purchasing cell phones and the recurring cost of 
      data transfer over a cellular network.

LID - 10.1186/1471-213X-13-29 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes aegypti is the most important global vector of dengue virus
      infection in humans. Availability of the draft genome sequence of this mosquito
      provides unique opportunities to study different aspects of its biology,
      including identification of genes and pathways relevant to the developmental
      processes associated with transition across individual life stages. However,
      detailed knowledge of gene expression patterns pertaining to developmental stages
      of A. aegypti is largely lacking. RESULTS: We performed custom cDNA microarray
      analyses to examine the expression patterns among six developmental stages: early
      larvae, late larvae, early pupae, late pupae, and adult male and female
      mosquitoes. Results revealed 1,551 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs)
      showing significant differences in levels of expression between these life
      stages. The data suggests that most of the differential expression occurs in a
      stage specific manner in A. aegypti. Based on hierarchical clustering of
      expression levels, correlated expression patterns of DETs were also observed
      among developmental stages. Weighted gene correlation network analysis revealed
      modular patterns of expression among the DETs. We observed that hydrolase
      activity, membrane, integral to membrane, DNA binding, translation, ribosome,
      nucleoside-triphosphatase activity, structural constituent of ribosome,
      ribonucleoprotein complex and receptor activity were among the top ten ranked GO 
      (Gene Ontology) terms associated with DETs. Significant associations of DETs were
      also observed with specific KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)
      pathway modules. Finally, comparisons with the previously reported developmental 
      transcriptome of the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, indicated that gene
      expression patterns during developmental processes reflect both species-specific 
      as well as common components of the two mosquito species. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      shows that genes involved in the developmental life cycle of A. aegypti are
      expressed in a highly stage-specific manner. This suggests that transcriptional
      events associated with transition through larval, pupal and adult stages are
      largely discrete.

AB  - AIM: Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the leading cause of viral neurologic
      disease and disability in Asia. In the present study JE virus-specific IgM in
      serum and CSF from acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) patients, attending Assam
      Medical College and Hospital (AMC and H), Dibrugarh, Assam from 2007 to 2009 were
      detected and different epidemiological parameters namely age, season and
      vaccination campaign were enumerated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional
      study on patients with AES admitted in AMC and H, Dibrugarh, Assam was done
      during 2007 to 2009. The different epidemiological features were characterized
      depending on a pretested structured questionnaire called the clinical information
      form (CIF). Serum and CSF obtained were tested by a Panbio JE-Dengue IgM Combo
      ELISA kit and JEV Chex kit (Xycton). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A z-test was used for 
      the statistical analytic assessment. RESULTS: Detection rate of JE was 39.4%,
      51.1%, and 51.3% in the years 2007, 2008, and 2009 respectively. Cases of JE
      increased in the age group more than 15 years in the district where the
      vaccination program was undertaken. This increase of cases from pediatric to
      adults is also statistically significant by the z-test (P<0.05). CONCLUSION:
      There was an increase in AES cases and also JE cases from 2007 to 2009. JE also
      showed a seasonal variation with maximum cases in the months of July and August. 
      Although vaccination campaigns with the live attenuated vaccine SA-14-14-2 have
      started and are protecting the under-15 children, there is a shift of disease
      pattern in the older population.

TI  - Sustained reduction of the dengue vector population resulting from an integrated 
      control strategy applied in two Brazilian cities.
PG  - e67682
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0067682 [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti has developed evolution-driven adaptations for surviving in the
      domestic human habitat. Several trap models have been designed considering these 
      strategies and tested for monitoring this efficient vector of Dengue. Here, we
      report a real-scale evaluation of a system for monitoring and controlling
      mosquito populations based on egg sampling coupled with geographic information
      systems technology. The SMCP-Aedes, a system based on open technology and open
      data standards, was set up from March/2008 to October/2011 as a pilot trial in
      two sites of Pernambuco -Brazil: Ipojuca (10,000 residents) and Santa Cruz
      (83,000), in a joint effort of health authorities and staff, and a network of
      scientists providing scientific support. A widespread infestation by Aedes was
      found in both sites in 2008-2009, with 96.8%-100% trap positivity. Egg densities 
      were markedly higher in SCC than in Ipojuca. A 90% decrease in egg density was
      recorded in SCC after two years of sustained control pressure imposed by
      suppression of >7,500,000 eggs and >3,200 adults, plus larval control by adding
      fishes to cisterns. In Ipojuca, 1.1 million mosquito eggs were suppressed and a
      77% reduction in egg density was achieved. This study aimed at assessing the
      applicability of a system using GIS and spatial statistic analysis tools for
      quantitative assessment of mosquito populations. It also provided useful
      information on the requirements for reducing well-established mosquito
      populations. Results from two cities led us to conclude that the success in
      markedly reducing an Aedes population required the appropriate choice of control 
      measures for sustained mass elimination guided by a user-friendly mosquito
      surveillance system. The system was able to support interventional decisions and 
      to assess the program's success. Additionally, it created a stimulating
      environment for health staff and residents, which had a positive impact on their 
      commitment to the dengue control program.

TI  - Obstruction of dengue virus maturation by Fab fragments of the 2H2 antibody.
PG  - 8909-15
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00472-13 [doi]
AB  - The 2H2 monoclonal antibody recognizes the precursor peptide on immature dengue
      virus and might therefore be a useful tool for investigating the conformational
      change that occurs when the immature virus enters an acidic environment. During
      dengue virus maturation, spiky, immature, noninfectious virions change their
      structure to form smooth-surfaced particles in the slightly acidic environment of
      the trans-Golgi network, thereby allowing cellular furin to cleave the
      precursor-membrane proteins. The dengue virions become fully infectious when they
      release the cleaved precursor peptide upon reaching the neutral-pH environment of
      the extracellular space. Here we report on the cryo-electron microscopy
      structures of the immature virus complexed with the 2H2 antigen binding fragments
      (Fab) at different concentrations and under various pH conditions. At neutral pH 
      and a high concentration of Fab molecules, three Fab molecules bind to three
      precursor-membrane proteins on each spike of the immature virus. However, at a
      low concentration of Fab molecules and pH 7.0, only two Fab molecules bind to
      each spike. Changing to a slightly acidic pH caused no detectable change of
      structure for the sample with a high Fab concentration but caused severe
      structural damage to the low-concentration sample. Therefore, the 2H2 Fab
      inhibits the maturation process of immature dengue virus when Fab molecules are
      present at a high concentration, because the three Fab molecules on each spike
      hold the precursor-membrane molecules together, thereby inhibiting the normal
      conformational change that occurs during maturation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DENV-1 is one of the four viral serotypes that causes Dengue, the
      most common mosquito-borne viral disease of humans. The prevalence of these
      viruses has grown in recent decades and is now present in more than 100
      countries. Limited studies document the spread of DENV-1 over the world despite
      its importance for human health. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used
      representative DENV-1 envelope gene sequences to unravel the dynamics of viral
      diffusion under a Bayesian phylogeographic approach. Data included strains from
      45 distinct geographic locations isolated from 1944 to 2009. The estimated mean
      rate of nucleotide substitution was 6.56 x 10(-)(4) substitutions/site/year. The 
      larger genotypes (I, IV and V) had a distinctive phylogenetic structure and since
      1990 they experienced effective population size oscillations. Thailand and
      Indonesia represented the main sources of strains for neighboring countries.
      Besides, Asia broadcast lineages into the Americas and the Pacific region that
      diverged in isolation. Also, a transmission network analysis revealed the pivotal
      role of Indochina in the global diffusion of DENV-1 and of the Caribbean in the
      diffusion over the Americas. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The study summarizes the
      spatiotemporal DENV-1 worldwide spread that may help disease control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Actions at European Union level for International Health Regulations 
      (IHR) 2005 implementation and maritime transport were focused on two European
      projects implemented between 2006 and 2011. METHOD: Situation analysis and needs 
      assessment were conducted, a Manual including European standards and best
      practice and training material was developed and training courses were delivered.
      Ship-to-port and port-to-port communication web-based network and database for
      recording IHR Ship Sanitation Certificates (SSC) were established. RESULTS: Fifty
      pilot inspections based on the Manual were conducted on passenger ships. A total 
      of 393 corrective actions were implemented according to recommendations given to 
      Captains during pilot inspections. The web-based communication network of
      competent authorities at ports in EU Member States was used to manage 13
      events/outbreaks (dengue fever, Legionnaires' disease, gastroenteritis,
      meningitis, varicella and measles). The European information database system was 
      used for producing and recording 1018 IHR SSC by 156 inspectors in 6 countries in
      accordance with the WHO Handbook for inspection of ships and issuance of SSC.
      CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of corrective actions after pilot inspections
      increased the level of compliance with the hygiene standards in passenger ships
      sailing within the EU waters and improved hygiene conditions. The communication
      tool contributed to improvement of outbreak identification and better management 
      through rapid sharing of public health information, allowing a more timely and
      coordinated response. After the implementation of actions on passenger ships, the
      European Commission co-funded a Joint action that will expand the activities to
      all types of ships and chemical, biological and radio-nuclear threats (deliberate
      acts/accidental).

TI  - A model for the spatial transmission of dengue with daily movement between
      villages and a city.
PG  - 150-78
LID - 10.1093/imammb/dqt002 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a re-emergent vector-borne disease affecting large portions of the
      world's population living in the tropics and subtropics. The virus is transmitted
      through the bites of female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, and it is widely believed
      that these bites occur primarily in the daytime. The transmission of dengue is a 
      complicated process, and one of the main sources of this complexity is due to the
      movement of people, e.g. between home and their places of work. Hence, the
      mechanics of disease progression may also differ between day and night. A
      discrete-time multi-patch dengue transmission model which takes into account the 
      mobility of people as well as processes of infection, recovery, recruitment,
      mortality, and outbound and return movements is considered here. One patch (the
      city) is connected to all other patches (the villages) in a spoke-like network.
      We obtain here the basic reproductive ratio (0) of the transmission model which
      represents a threshold for an epidemic to occur. Dynamical analysis for vector
      control, human treatment and vaccination, and different kinds of mobility are
      performed. It is shown that changes in human movement patterns can, in some
      situations, affect the ability of the disease to persist in a predictable manner.
      We conclude with biological implications for the prevention and control of dengue
      virus transmission.

TI  - Dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus epidemiological shifts in Nepal: a
      case of opposing trends.
PG  - 677-80
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.12-0436 [doi]
AB  - We report on the changing epidemiology of two important flaviviruses in Nepal:
      Japanese encephalitis (JE) and dengue viruses. Morbidity and mortality in Nepal
      is in the thousands since JE was introduced in 1978. Nepal launched an extensive 
      laboratory-based JE surveillance in 2004. Nepal experienced a remarkable
      reduction in disease burden after mass immunizations from 2005 to 2010, when
      2,040 JE infections and 205 JE-related deaths were confirmed. With its emergence 
      in 2006, dengue has become a significant challenge in the country, highlighted by
      a sudden outbreak in 2010 that resulted in 359 confirmed dengue infections.
      Currently, both viruses cocirculate in Nepal. Here, we document the remarkable
      expansion of dengue in Nepal, which urgently requires national surveillance to
      refine the burden and make recommendations regarding control and prevention
      programs. We believe that the use of existing JE surveillance network for
      integrated dengue surveillance may represent the most appropriate alternative.

TI  - Intertwined arbovirus transmission activity: reassessing the transmission cycle
      paradigm.
PG  - 493
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2012.00493 [doi]
AB  - Arboviruses are emerging/reemerging infectious agents worldwide. The factors
      within this scenario include vector and host population fluctuations, climatic
      changes, anthropogenic activities that disturb ecosystems, an increase in
      international flights, human mobility, and genetic mutations that allow
      spill-over phenomenon. Arboviruses are maintained by biologic transmission among 
      vectors and hosts. Sometimes this biological transmission is specific and
      includes one vector and host species such as Chikungunya (CHIKV), Dengue (DENV), 
      and urban Yellow Fever (YFV). However, most of the arboviruses are generalist and
      they use many vectors and hosts species. From this perspective, arboviruses are
      maintained through a transmission network rather than a transmission cycle. This 
      allows us to understand the complexity and dynamics of the transmission and
      maintenance of arboviruses in the ecosystems. The old perspective that
      arboviruses are maintained in close and stable transmission cycles should be
      modified by a new more integrative and dynamic idea, representing the real
      scenario where biological interactions have a much broader representation,
      indicating the constant adaptability of the biological entities.

TI  - Optimization of the cutoff value for a commercial anti-dengue virus IgG
      immunoassay.
PG  - 358-62
LID - 10.1128/CVI.00429-12 [doi]
AB  - A commercial anti-dengue virus (anti-DENV) indirect IgG enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for serological diagnosis was evaluated for its
      utility in determining previous DENV exposure in U.S. travelers. The Boston Area 
      Travel Medicine Network clinics used Focus Diagnostics anti-DENV IgG ELISA to
      measure anti-DENV IgG antibodies in 591 pretravel specimens from U.S. residents
      who had traveled to countries where dengue is endemic. When using the
      manufacturer's index cutoff value for this ELISA, false-positive results were
      observed that overestimated the perceived past DENV exposure in U.S. travelers.
      Validation of 121 of these anti-DENV IgG results by plaque reduction
      neutralization test (PRNT) was used for receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
      curve optimization of the index cutoff value from 1 to 3.0, improving the
      specificity of the anti-DENV IgG ELISA from 24% to 95.7%. Additionally, previous 
      vaccination with yellow fever virus contributed to 52.8% of the false-positive
      rate in the anti-DENV IgG ELISA results. Optimization of the cutoff value of the 
      anti-DENV IgG ELISA provided better interpretation and confidence in the results 
      and eliminated the need for confirmation by PRNT. The travel history of U.S.
      travelers was also useful for categorizing these travelers into groups for
      analysis of previous DENV exposure.

TI  - Expatriates ill after travel: results from the Geosentinel Surveillance Network.
PG  - 386
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-12-386 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expatriates are a distinct population at unique risk for health
      problems related to their travel exposure. METHODS: We analyzed GeoSentinel data 
      comparing ill returned expatriates with other travelers for demographics, travel 
      characteristics, and proportionate morbidity (PM) for travel-related illness.
      RESULTS: Our study included 2,883 expatriates and 11,910 non-expatriates who
      visited GeoSentinel clinics ill after travel. Expatriates were more likely to be 
      male, do volunteer work, be long-stay travelers (>6 months), and have sought
      pre-travel advice. Compared to non-expatriates, expatriates returning from Africa
      had higher proportionate morbidity (PM) for malaria, filariasis, schistosomiasis,
      and hepatitis E; expatriates from the Asia-Pacific region had higher PM for
      strongyloidiasis, depression, and anxiety; expatriates returning from Latin
      America had higher PM for mononucleosis and ingestion-related infections
      (giardiasis, brucellosis). Expatriates returning from all three regions had
      higher PM for latent TB, amebiasis, and gastrointestinal infections (other than
      acute diarrhea) compared to non-expatriates. When the data were stratified by
      travel reason, business expatriates had higher PM for febrile systemic illness
      (malaria and dengue) and vaccine-preventable infections (hepatitis A), and
      volunteer expatriates had higher PM for parasitic infections. Expatriates overall
      had higher adjusted odds ratios for latent TB and lower odds ratios for acute
      diarrhea and dermatologic illness. CONCLUSIONS: Ill returned expatriates differ
      from other travelers in travel characteristics and proportionate morbidity for
      specific diseases, based on the region of exposure and travel reason. They are
      more likely to present with more serious illness.

AB  - Kobe-Indonesia Collaborative Research Center was established in Institute of
      Tropical Disease (ITD), Airlangga University, Surabaya, Indonesia in 2007 under
      the program of ''Founding Research Centers for Emerging and Reemerging Infectious
      Diseases'' supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and
      Technology, Japan, and then it has been under the Japan Initiative for Global
      Research Network on Infectious Diseases (J-GRID) since 2010. Japanese researchers
      have been stationed at ITD, conducting joint researches on influenza, viral
      hepatitis, dengue and infectious diarrhea. Also, another Japanese researcher has 
      been stationed at Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia, Jakarta, carrying
      out joint researches on'' Identification of anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      substances and development of HCV and dengue vaccines'' in collaboration with
      University of Indonesia and Airlangga University through the Science and
      Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) supported
      by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and Japan International
      Cooperation Agency (JICA) since 2009. In this article, we briefly introduce the
      background history of Kobe University Research Center in Indonesia, and discuss
      the research themes and outcomes of J-GRID and SATREPS activities.

AB  - Regulated by pH, membrane-anchored proteins E and M function during dengue virus 
      maturation and membrane fusion. Our atomic model of the whole virion from
      cryo-electron microscopy at 3.5-A resolution reveals that in the mature virus at 
      neutral extracellular pH, the N-terminal 20-amino-acid segment of M (involving
      three pH-sensing histidines) latches and thereby prevents spring-loaded E fusion 
      protein from prematurely exposing its fusion peptide. This M latch is fastened at
      an earlier stage, during maturation at acidic pH in the trans-Golgi network. At a
      later stage, to initiate infection in response to acidic pH in the late endosome,
      M releases the latch and exposes the fusion peptide. Thus, M serves as a
      multistep chaperone of E to control the conformational changes accompanying
      maturation and infection. These pH-sensitive interactions could serve as targets 
      for drug discovery.

TI  - Gene flow networks among American Aedes aegypti populations.
PG  - 664-76
LID - 10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00244.x [doi]
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti, the dengue virus vector, has spread throughout the
      tropics in historical times. While this suggests man-mediated dispersal,
      estimating contemporary connectivity among populations has remained elusive.
      Here, we use a large mtDNA dataset and a Bayesian coalescent framework to test a 
      set of hypotheses about gene flow among American Ae. aegypti populations. We
      assessed gene flow patterns at the continental and subregional (Amazon basin)
      scales. For the Americas, our data favor a stepping-stone model in which gene
      flow is higher among adjacent populations but in which, at the same time, North
      American and southeastern Brazilian populations are directly connected, likely
      via sea trade. Within Amazonia, the model with highest support suggests extensive
      gene flow among major cities; Manaus, located at the center of the subregional
      transport network, emerges as a potentially important connecting hub. Our results
      suggest substantial connectivity across Ae. aegypti populations in the Americas. 
      As long-distance active dispersal has not been observed in this species, our data
      support man-mediated dispersal as a major determinant of the genetic structure of
      American Ae. aegypti populations. The inferred topology of interpopulation
      connectivity can inform network models of Ae. aegypti and dengue spread.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the quantity and distribution of evidence from randomised
      controlled trials for the treatment of the major neglected tropical diseases and 
      to identify gaps in the evidence with network analysis. DESIGN: Systematic review
      and network analysis. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
      Trials and PubMed from inception to 31 August 2011. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised
      controlled trials that examined treatment of 16 neglected tropical diseases or
      complications thereof published in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, 
      or Dutch. RESULTS: We identified 971 eligible randomised trials. Leishmaniasis
      (184 trials, 23,039 participants) and geohelminth infections; 160 trials, 46,887 
      participants) were the most studied, while dracunculiasis (nine trials, 798
      participants) and Buruli ulcer (five trials, 337 participants) were least
      studied. Relative to its global burden of disease, lymphatic filariasis had the
      fewest trials and participants. Only 11% of trials were industry funded. Either a
      single trial or trials with fewer than 100 participants comprised the randomised 
      evidence for first or second line treatments for Buruli ulcer, human African
      trypanosomiasis, American trypanosomiasis, cysticercosis, rabies, echinococcosis,
      New World cutaneous leishmaniasis, and each of the foodborne trematode
      infections. Among the 10 disease categories with more than 40 trials, five lacked
      sufficient head to head comparisons between first or second line treatments.
      CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable variation in the amount of evidence from
      randomised controlled trials for each of the 16 major neglected tropical
      diseases. Even in diseases with substantial evidence, such as leishmaniasis and
      geohelminth infections, some recommended treatments have limited supporting data 
      and lack head to head comparisons.

TI  - Rapid intraspecific evolution of miRNA and siRNA genes in the mosquito Aedes
      aegypti.
PG  - e44198
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0044198 [doi]
AB  - RNA silencing, or RNA interference (RNAi) in metazoans mediates development,
      reduces viral infection and limits transposon mobility. RNA silencing involves
      21-30 nucleotide RNAs classified into microRNA (miRNA), exogenous and endogenous 
      small interfering RNAs (siRNA), and Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA). Knock-out,
      silencing and mutagenesis of genes in the exogenous siRNA (exo-siRNA) regulatory 
      network demonstrate the importance of this RNAi pathway in antiviral immunity in 
      Drosophila and mosquitoes. In Drosophila, genes encoding components for
      processing exo-siRNAs are among the fastest evolving 3% of all genes, suggesting 
      that infection with pathogenic RNA viruses may drive diversifying selection in
      their host. In contrast, paralogous miRNA pathway genes do not evolve more
      rapidly than the genome average. Silencing of exo-siRNA pathway genes in
      mosquitoes orally infected with arboviruses leads to increased viral replication,
      but little is known about the comparative patterns of molecular evolution among
      the exo-siRNA and miRNA pathways genes in mosquitoes. We generated nearly
      complete sequences of all exons of major miRNA and siRNA pathway genes dicer-1
      and dicer-2, argonaute-1 and argonaute-2, and r3d1 and r2d2 in 104 Aedes aegypti 
      mosquitoes collected from six distinct geographic populations and analyzed their 
      genetic diversity. The ratio of replacement to silent amino acid substitutions
      was 1.4 fold higher in dicer-2 than in dicer-1, 27.4 fold higher in argonaute-2
      than in argonaute-1 and similar in r2d2 and r3d1. Positive selection was
      supported in 32% of non-synonymous sites in dicer-1, in 47% of sites in dicer-2, 
      in 30% of sites in argonaute-1, in all sites in argonaute-2, in 22% of sites in
      r3d1 and in 55% of sites in r2d2. Unlike Drosophila, in Ae. aegypti, both
      exo-siRNA and miRNA pathway genes appear to be undergoing rapid, positive,
      diversifying selection. Furthermore, refractoriness of mosquitoes to infection
      with dengue virus was significantly positively correlated for nucleotide
      diversity indices in dicer-2.

TI  - Transplantation of a hydrogen bonding network from West Nile virus protease onto 
      Dengue-2 protease improves catalytic efficiency and sheds light on substrate
      specificity.
PG  - 843-50
LID - 10.1093/protein/gzs049 [doi]
AB  - The two-component serine protease of flaviviruses such as Dengue virus (DENV) and
      West Nile virus (WNV) are attractive targets for inhibitor/therapeutic design.
      Peptide aldehyde inhibitors that bind to the covalently tethered two-component
      WNV protease (WNVpro) with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) at
      sub-micromolar concentrations, bind the equivalent DENV-2 protease (DEN2pro) with
      IC(50) of micromolar concentrations at best. Conversely, the protease inhibitor
      aprotinin binds DEN2pro approximately 1000-fold more tightly than WNVpro. To
      investigate the residues that are crucial for binding specificity differences, a 
      binding-site network of hydrogen bonds was transplanted from WNVpro onto DEN2pro.
      The transplantations were a combination of single, double and triple mutations
      involving S79D, S83N and S85Q. The mutant DENV proteases, except those involving 
      S85Q, proved to be more efficient enzymes, as measured by their kinetic
      parameters. The binding affinities of the mutants to peptide inhibitors however
      showed only marginal improvement. Protein structure modeling suggests that the
      negatively charged residue cluster, Glu89-Glu92, of the NS2B cofactor may play an
      important role in determining substrate/inhibitor-binding specificity. These same
      residues may also explain why aprotinin binds more tightly to DEN2pro than
      WNVpro. Our results suggest that structure-based inhibitor design experiments
      need to explicitly consider/include this C-terminal region whose negative charge 
      is conserved across the four DENV serotypes and also among the flavivirus family 
      of proteases.

TI  - Open field release of genetically engineered sterile male Aedes aegypti in
      Malaysia.
PG  - e42771
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0042771 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease. In the
      absence of specific drugs or vaccines, control focuses on suppressing the
      principal mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, yet current methods have not proven
      adequate to control the disease. New methods are therefore urgently needed, for
      example genetics-based sterile-male-release methods. However, this requires that 
      lab-reared, modified mosquitoes be able to survive and disperse adequately in the
      field. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Adult male mosquitoes were released into
      an uninhabited forested area of Pahang, Malaysia. Their survival and dispersal
      was assessed by use of a network of traps. Two strains were used, an engineered
      'genetically sterile' (OX513A) and a wild-type laboratory strain, to give both
      absolute and relative data about the performance of the modified mosquitoes. The 
      two strains had similar maximum dispersal distances (220 m), but mean distance
      travelled of the OX513A strain was lower (52 vs. 100 m). Life expectancy was
      similar (2.0 vs. 2.2 days). Recapture rates were high for both strains, possibly 
      because of the uninhabited nature of the site. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: After
      extensive contained studies and regulatory scrutiny, a field release of
      engineered mosquitoes was safely and successfully conducted in Malaysia. The
      engineered strain showed similar field longevity to an unmodified counterpart,
      though in this setting dispersal was reduced relative to the unmodified strain.
      These data are encouraging for the future testing and implementation of genetic
      control strategies and will help guide future field use of this and other
      engineered strains.

TI  - Web-based GIS: the vector-borne disease airline importation risk (VBD-AIR) tool.
PG  - 33
LID - 10.1186/1476-072X-11-33 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past century, the size and complexity of the air travel
      network has increased dramatically. Nowadays, there are 29.6 million scheduled
      flights per year and around 2.7 billion passengers are transported annually. The 
      rapid expansion of the network increasingly connects regions of endemic
      vector-borne disease with the rest of the world, resulting in challenges to
      health systems worldwide in terms of vector-borne pathogen importation and
      disease vector invasion events. Here we describe the development of a
      user-friendly Web-based GIS tool: the Vector-Borne Disease Airline Importation
      Risk Tool (VBD-AIR), to help better define the roles of airports and airlines in 
      the transmission and spread of vector-borne diseases. METHODS: Spatial datasets
      on modeled global disease and vector distributions, as well as climatic and air
      network traffic data were assembled. These were combined to derive relative risk 
      metrics via air travel for imported infections, imported vectors and onward
      transmission, and incorporated into a three-tier server architecture in a
      Model-View-Controller framework with distributed GIS components. A user-friendly 
      web-portal was built that enables dynamic querying of the spatial databases to
      provide relevant information. RESULTS: The VBD-AIR tool constructed enables the
      user to explore the interrelationships among modeled global distributions of
      vector-borne infectious diseases (malaria. dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya) 
      and international air service routes to quantify seasonally changing risks of
      vector and vector-borne disease importation and spread by air travel, forming an 
      evidence base to help plan mitigation strategies. The VBD-AIR tool is available
      at http://www.vbd-air.com. CONCLUSIONS: VBD-AIR supports a data flow that
      generates analytical results from disparate but complementary datasets into an
      organized cartographical presentation on a web map for the assessment of
      vector-borne disease movements on the air travel network. The framework built
      provides a flexible and robust informatics infrastructure by separating the
      modules of functionality through an ontological model for vector-borne disease.
      The VBDAIR tool is designed as an evidence base for visualizing the risks of
      vector-borne disease by air travel for a wide range of users, including planners 
      and decisions makers based in state and local government, and in particular,
      those at international and domestic airports tasked with planning for health
      risks and allocating limited resources.

TI  - Elevated serum levels of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein in
      dengue-infected patients are associated with disease symptoms and secondary
      infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) is described as the most prevalent arbovirus,
      infecting at least 50 million people worldwide. During infection, an intricate
      network of cytokines, a group of substances closely related to disease severity, 
      is released. Recently, it was observed that both DENV-infected epithelial cells
      undergoing necrosis and dendritic cells (DCs) are able to release a non-classical
      pro-inflammatory cytokine called high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). OBJECTIVES:
      The aim of this study was to evaluate whether HMGB1 levels were altered in
      DENV-infected patients' sera and whether this augment correlated with disease
      pathogenesis. STUDY DESIGN: Samples from DENV-infected patients were collected
      from different days after the onset of symptoms and from patients experiencing
      primary or secondary infection. The circulating HMGB1 concentration was measured 
      in healthy blood donors as well as in donors with primary and secondary cases of 
      DENV infection by a quantitative capture ELISA assay. RESULTS: We observed that
      the HMGB1 concentration in DENV-infected patients was significantly higher than
      in healthy patients. HMGB1 levels reached the highest concentration in the first 
      day after the onset of symptoms and decreased throughout the course of the
      infection. Moreover, we observed that the HMGB1 concentration was augmented
      during secondary infection as well. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that HMGB1 levels 
      correlate with disease pathogenesis, specifically with the clinical symptoms and 
      secondary infection, implicating a pro-inflammatory cytokine role for HMGB1 in
      DENV infection. This is the first report assessing the circulating levels of
      HMGB1 during DENV infection.

LID - 10.1007/s12098-012-0791-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence, etiology, short term outcome and
      predictors of mortality in hospitalized children aged 1 mo to 13 y with Acute
      Kidney Injury (AKI). METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted 
      in the pediatric wards and the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary
      hospital in southern India, to study the clinico-etiological profile of AKI
      (defined according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria). From June 2010
      through March 2011, 2376 children were included in the study. RESULTS: The
      incidence of AKI was 5.2 % in the pediatric wards and 25.1 % in the PICU. AKI
      occurred in association with infections (55.4 %), acute glomerulonephritis (16.9 
      %), cardiac disease (4.8 %), envenomations (4.2 %) and hemolytic uremic syndrome 
      (3.6 %). Pneumonia constituted 26.1 % of the infections. Tropical febrile
      illnesses (dengue, scrub typhus, enteric fever, cholera, tuberculosis, malaria
      and leptospirosis) constituted 15.6 % of children with AKI. Dialysis was required
      in 14.5 % of patients; mortality was 17.5 %. A significant proportion of children
      (17.5 % of survivors) had partial renal recovery at discharge. On multivariate
      logistic regression, dysnatremia and meningoencephalitis were independent
      predictors of mortality in AKI. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AKI is high in the 
      patient population, including the non-critically ill children. AKI continues to
      be associated with adverse outcomes. Presence of dysnatremia and
      meningoencephalitis are poor predictors of outcome in AKI.

AB  - Dengue has been designated a major international public health problem by the
      World Health Organization (WHO). It is endemic in most tropical and sub-tropical 
      countries, which are also popular tourist destinations. Travellers are not only
      at significant risk of acquiring dengue but they also contribute to its spread to
      non-endemic regions. Furthermore, they may serve as sentinels to alert the
      international community to epidemics in dengue-endemic regions. GeoSentinel, a
      global surveillance network, monitors all travel-related illnesses and estimates 
      that dengue accounts for 2% of all illness in travellers returning from
      dengue-endemic regions. In fact, in travellers returning from South-east Asia,
      dengue is now a more frequent cause of febrile illness than malaria.
      Dengue-infected travellers returning home to countries where the vector exists
      can place the local population at risk of further spread of the disease with
      subsequent autochthonous cycles of infection. The true incidence of dengue
      amongst travellers may be underestimated because of variability in reporting
      requirements in different countries and under-diagnosis owing to the non-specific
      clinical presentation of the disease. Risk factors for acquiring dengue include
      duration of stay, season of travel and epidemic activity at the destination. Any 
      pre-travel advice on the risks of developing dengue infections should consider
      these factors.

AB  - The number of travel-acquired dengue infections has been on a constant rise in
      the United States and Europe over the past decade. An increased volume of
      international passenger air traffic originating from regions with endemic dengue 
      contributes to the increasing number of dengue cases. This paper reports results 
      from a network-based regression model which uses international passenger travel
      volumes, travel distances, predictive species distribution models (for the vector
      species), and infection data to quantify the relative risk of importing
      travel-acquired dengue infections into the US and Europe from dengue-endemic
      regions. Given the necessary data, this model can be used to identify optimal
      locations (origin cities, destination airports, etc.) for dengue surveillance.
      The model can be extended to other geographical regions and vector-borne
      diseases, as well as other network-based processes.

TI  - Dengue and soluble mediators of the innate immune system.
PG  - 53-62
LID - 10.2149/tmh.2011-S06 [doi]
AB  - Huge emphasis has been placed on the role of the adaptive immune system in dengue
      pathogenesis. Yet there is increasing evidence for the importance of the innate
      immune system in regulating dengue infection and possibly influencing the
      disease. This review focuses on the interplay between the innate immune system
      and dengue and highlights the role of soluble immunological mediators. Type I and
      type II interferons of the innate immune system demonstrate non-overlapping roles
      in dengue infection. Furthermore, while some IFN responses to dengue are
      protective, others may exert disease-related effects on the host. But aside from 
      interferons, a number of cytokines have also been implicated in dengue
      pathogenesis. Our expanding knowledge of cytokines indicates that these soluble
      mediators act upon a complicated network of events to provoke the disease. This
      cytokine storm is generally attributed to massive T cell activation as an outcome
      of secondary infection. However, there is reason to believe that innate immune
      response-derived cytokines also have contributory effects, especially in the
      context of severe cases of primary dengue infection. Another less popular but
      interesting perspective on dengue pathogenesis is the effect of mosquito feeding 
      on host immune responses and viral infection. Various studies have shown that
      soluble factors from vector saliva have the capacity to alter immune reactions
      and thereby influence pathogen transmission and establishment. Hence, modulation 
      of the innate immune system at various levels of infection is a critical
      component of dengue disease. In the absence of an approved drug or vaccine for
      dengue, soluble mediators of the innate immune system could be a strategic
      foothold for developing anti-viral therapeutics and improving clinical
      management.

TI  - Acute kidney injury in dengue fever using Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria:
      incidence and risk factors.
PG  - 160-2
LID - 10.1258/td.2012.120023 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess incidence and risk factors for acute kidney
      injury (AKI) in patients with dengue fever (DF). A total of 223 patients (males, 
      130; females, 93; mean age, 26.2 +/- 18.2 years) from a tertiary care centre in
      southern India were retrospectively analysed. Acute renal failure (ARF) developed
      in 24 (10.8%) patients. Based on the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria,
      the results revealed that: 12 (5.4%) had mild AKI; seven (3.1%) had moderate AKI;
      and five (2.2%) had severe AKI. A further 54 (24%) were diagnosed with dengue
      haemorrhagic fever (DHF); 11 (5%) were co-infected with leptospirosis;
      thrombocytopenia was present in 157 (70%); and 64 (29%) were hypotensive.
      Patients were divided into either group A (with AKI) or group B (without AKI),
      and group A was divided into mild (A1), moderate (A2) and severe (A3) subgroups. 
      We recorded: a higher total white count (A = 9824; B = 6706; P = 0.01); serum
      glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT; A = 450; B = 144; P = 0.001); alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP) levels (A = 207; B = 42; P = 0.001); lower albumin (A = 2.65; B
      = 3.09; P < 0.001); and serum bicarbonate (A = 20.57; B = 23.21; P = 0.009).
      Hypotension (P = 0.01), coexisting viral hepatitis (P < 0.001), sepsis (P <
      0.001), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS; P < 0.001) and the need for
      inotropes (P < 0.001) were associated with DF. Total white count (P = 0.038),
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) on discharge (P = 0.034), specific gravity of
      urine (P = 0.006), ALP (P = 0.013), SGPT (P = 0.042), MODS (P = 0.05) and use of 
      platelet fresh frozen plasma (FFP; P = 0.007) were significantly different
      between mild, moderate and severe AKI subgroups. Twenty-two (9%) died. AKI is
      associated with an increased mortality in DF (P = 0.005).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Mesoamerican Public Health Institute (IMSP) was constituted in
      2009 as the technical organ of the Mesoamerican Public Health System (SMSP) and
      the Virtual Network of Academic Institutions. Health system capacity
      strengthening needs and preliminary training results were assessed in the first
      phase. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The SMSP Master Plans were content-analyzed for each
      priority and members of the Malaria and Dengue Working Group were surveyed.
      RESULTS: The training needs required for each SMSP priority area were identified 
      and knowledge management needs for malaria and dengue analyzed. Competencies were
      mapped across strategic, tactical and operative personnel that will be requiring 
      them. IMSP trained in its first year 91 persons in eight countries. CONCLUSIONS: 
      IMSP is responding to the Mesoamerican region's public health needs.

TI  - Media scanning and verification system as a supplemental tool to disease outbreak
      detection & reporting at National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi.
PG  - 9-14
AB  - Media scanning for unusual health events can efficiently supplement conventional 
      communicable disease surveillance systems for early detection and response to
      outbreaks. There is a need to rapidly process and appropriately disseminate the
      media reports on unusual health events for timely action. Hence to address this
      need in India a Media Scanning & Verification Cell (MSVC) was established in July
      2008 at the National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi. MSVC is supervised by
      Epidemiologists working in Central Surveillance Unit of IDSP. This unique system 
      monitors Global and National Media sources such as National and Regional print
      media, news on internet, news wires and websites, news channels and news shared
      by partners like Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), Canada, WHO
      and other International and national agencies. The information is shared to the
      districts affected and District Surveillance Officer (DSO) and his team is
      expected to investigate and revert through the internet about the correctness and
      action taken. A mean number of 4 Media Alert reports are generated each day. A
      total of 1685 alerts were reported in a period between July 2008 to December
      2011. Of these 1241 (73.7%) were verified as real events and 183 (10.9%) were
      considered outbreaks by local health officials. Most events were captured through
      internet (57%) followed by the print media (24%). The most common disease events 
      identified were food-borne and diarrhea (29.1%), dengue (10.68%), influenza &
      respiratory disease (8.1%) and malaria (7.4%). The sensitivity of MSVC to detect 
      outbreaks was 14.8% with more than half of outbreaks detected before they were
      identified by the conventional surveillance system. It has proven to be a highly 
      effective supplemental tool to official surveillance system in the detection of
      early warning signals and hence timely detection and management of public health 
      threats in India.

TI  - Characteristics and spectrum of disease among ill returned travelers from pre-
      and post-earthquake Haiti: The GeoSentinel experience.
PG  - 23-8

AB  - To describe patient characteristics and disease spectrum among foreign visitors
      to Haiti before and after the 2010 earthquake, we used GeoSentinel Global
      Surveillance Network data and compared 1 year post-earthquake versus 3 years
      pre-earthquake. Post-earthquake travelers were younger, predominantly from the
      United States, more frequently international assistance workers, and more often
      medically counseled before their trip than pre-earthquake travelers. Work-related
      stress and upper respiratory tract infections were more frequent post-earthquake;
      acute diarrhea, dengue, and Plasmodium falciparum malaria were important
      contributors of morbidity both pre- and post-earthquake. These data highlight the
      importance of providing destination- and disaster-specific pre-travel counseling 
      and post-travel evaluation and medical management to persons traveling to or
      returning from a disaster location, and evaluations should include attention to
      the psychological wellbeing of these travelers. For travel to Haiti, focus should
      be on mosquito-borne illnesses (dengue and P. falciparum malaria) and travelers' 
      diarrhea.

TI  - Establishing a community of practice of researchers, practitioners, policy-makers
      and communities to sustainably manage environmental health risks in Ecuador.
PG  - S5
LID - 10.1186/1472-698X-11-S2-S5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Sustainably Managing Environmental Health Risk in Ecuador project
      was launched in 2004 as a partnership linking a large Canadian university with
      leading Cuban and Mexican institutes to strengthen the capacities of four
      Ecuadorian universities for leading community-based learning and research in
      areas as diverse as pesticide poisoning, dengue control, water and sanitation,
      and disaster preparedness. METHODS: In implementing curriculum and complementary 
      innovations through application of an ecosystem approach to health, our
      interdisciplinary international team focused on the question: "Can strengthening 
      of institutional capacities to support a community of practice of researchers,
      practitioners, policy-makers and communities produce positive health outcomes and
      improved capacities to sustainably translate knowledge?" To assess progress in
      achieving desired outcomes, we review results associated with the logic framework
      analysis used to guide the project, focusing on how a community of practice
      network has strengthened implementation, including follow-up tracking of program 
      trainees and presentation of two specific case studies. RESULTS: By 2009,
      train-the-trainer project initiation involved 27 participatory action research
      Master's theses in 15 communities where 1200 community learners participated in
      the implementation of associated interventions. This led to establishment of
      innovative Ecuadorian-led master's and doctoral programs, and a Population Health
      Observatory on Collective Health, Environment and Society for the Andean region
      based at the Universidad Andina Simon Bolivar. Building on this network, numerous
      initiatives were begun, such as an internationally funded research project to
      strengthen dengue control in the coastal community of Machala, and establishment 
      of a local community eco-health centre focusing on determinants of health near
      Cuenca. DISCUSSION: Strengthening capabilities for producing and applying
      knowledge through direct engagement with affected populations and decision-makers
      provides a fertile basis for consolidating capacities to act on a larger scale.
      This can facilitate the capturing of benefits from the "top down" (in
      consolidating institutional commitments) and the "bottom up" (to achieve local
      results). CONCLUSIONS: Alliances of academic and non-academic partners from the
      South and North provide a promising orientation for learning together about ways 
      of addressing negative trends of development. Assessing the impacts and
      sustainability of such processes, however, requires longer term monitoring of
      results and related challenges.

AB  - The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC), Division of Global Emerging 
      Infections Surveillance and Response System conducts disease surveillance through
      a global network of US Department of Defense research laboratories and
      partnerships with foreign ministries of agriculture, health and livestock
      development in over 90 countries worldwide. In 2010, AFHSC supported zoonosis
      survey efforts were organized into four main categories: (i) development of field
      assays for animal disease surveillance during deployments and in resource limited
      environments, (ii) determining zoonotic disease prevalence in high-contact
      species which may serve as important reservoirs of diseases and sources of
      transmission, (iii) surveillance in high-risk human populations which are more
      likely to become exposed and subsequently infected with zoonotic pathogens and
      (iv) surveillance at the human-animal interface examining zoonotic disease
      prevalence and transmission within and between human and animal populations.
      These efforts have aided in the detection, identification and quantification of
      the burden of zoonotic diseases such as anthrax, brucellosis, Crimean Congo
      haemorrhagic fever, dengue fever, Hantaan virus, influenza, Lassa fever,
      leptospirosis, melioidosis, Q fever, Rift Valley fever, sandfly fever Sicilian
      virus, sandfly fever Naples virus, tuberculosis and West Nile virus, which are of
      military and public health importance. Future zoonotic surveillance efforts will 
      seek to develop local capacity for zoonotic surveillance focusing on high risk
      populations at the human-animal interface.

TI  - Global cross-talk of genes of the mosquito Aedes aegypti in response to dengue
      virus infection.
PG  - e1385
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001385 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of dengue virus
      (DENV) infection in humans, and DENV is the most important arbovirus across most 
      of the subtropics and tropics worldwide. The early time periods after infection
      with DENV define critical cellular processes that determine ultimate success or
      failure of the virus to establish infection in the mosquito. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      To identify genes involved in these processes, we performed genome-wide
      transcriptome profiling between susceptible and refractory A. aegypti strains at 
      two critical early periods after challenging them with DENV. Genes that responded
      coordinately to DENV infection in the susceptible strain were largely clustered
      in one specific expression module, whereas in the refractory strain they were
      distributed in four distinct modules. The susceptible response module in the
      global transcriptional network showed significant biased representation with
      genes related to energy metabolism and DNA replication, whereas the refractory
      response modules showed biased representation across different metabolism pathway
      genes including cytochrome P450 and DDT [1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) 
      ethane] degradation genes, and genes associated with cell growth and death. A
      common core set of coordinately expressed genes was observed in both the
      susceptible and refractory mosquitoes and included genes related to the Wnt (Wnt:
      wingless [wg] and integration 1 [int1] pathway), MAPK (Mitogen-activated protein 
      kinase), mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and JAK-STAT (Janus Kinase - Signal
      Transducer and Activator of Transcription) pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our data
      revealed extensive transcriptional networks of mosquito genes that are expressed 
      in modular manners in response to DENV infection, and indicated that successfully
      defending against viral infection requires more elaborate gene networks than
      hosting the virus. These likely play important roles in the global-cross talk
      among the mosquito host factors during the critical early DENV infection periods 
      that trigger the appropriate host action in susceptible vs. refractory
      mosquitoes.

TI  - Flavivirus NS3 and NS5 proteins interaction network: a high-throughput yeast
      two-hybrid screen.
PG  - 234
LID - 10.1186/1471-2180-11-234 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genus Flavivirus encompasses more than 50 distinct species of
      arthropod-borne viruses, including several major human pathogens, such as West
      Nile virus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and the four
      serotypes of dengue viruses (DENV type 1-4). Each year, flaviviruses cause more
      than 100 million infections worldwide, some of which lead to life-threatening
      conditions such as encephalitis or haemorrhagic fever. Among the viral proteins, 
      NS3 and NS5 proteins constitute the major enzymatic components of the viral
      replication complex and are essential to the flavivirus life cycle. RESULTS: We
      report here the results of a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screen to identify 
      the interactions between human host proteins and the flavivirus NS3 and NS5
      proteins. Using our screen results and literature curation, we performed a global
      analysis of the NS3 and NS5 cellular targets based on functional annotation with 
      the Gene Ontology features. We finally created the first flavivirus NS3 and NS5
      proteins interaction network and analysed the topological features of this
      network. Our proteome mapping screen identified 108 human proteins interacting
      with NS3 or NS5 proteins or both. The global analysis of the cellular targets
      revealed the enrichment of host proteins involved in RNA binding, transcription
      regulation, vesicular transport or innate immune response regulation.
      CONCLUSIONS: We proposed that the selective disruption of these newly identified 
      host/virus interactions could represent a novel and attractive therapeutic
      strategy in treating flavivirus infections. Our virus-host interaction map
      provides a basis to unravel fundamental processes about flavivirus subversion of 
      the host replication machinery and/or immune defence strategy.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), an emerging mosquito-transmitted pathogen capable of causing
      severe disease in humans, interacts with host cell factors to create a more
      favorable environment for replication. However, few interactions between DENV and
      human proteins have been reported to date. To identify DENV-human protein
      interactions, we used high-throughput yeast two-hybrid assays to screen the 10
      DENV proteins against a human liver activation domain library. From 45
      DNA-binding domain clones containing either full-length viral genes or partially 
      overlapping gene fragments, we identified 139 interactions between DENV and human
      proteins, the vast majority of which are novel. These interactions involved 105
      human proteins, including six previously implicated in DENV infection and 45
      linked to the replication of other viruses. Human proteins with functions related
      to the complement and coagulation cascade, the centrosome, and the cytoskeleton
      were enriched among the DENV interaction partners. To determine if the cellular
      proteins were required for DENV infection, we used small interfering RNAs to
      inhibit their expression. Six of 12 proteins targeted (CALR, DDX3X, ERC1, GOLGA2,
      TRIP11, and UBE2I) caused a significant decrease in the replication of a DENV
      replicon. We further showed that calreticulin colocalized with viral dsRNA and
      with the viral NS3 and NS5 proteins in DENV-infected cells, consistent with a
      direct role for calreticulin in DENV replication. Human proteins that interacted 
      with DENV had significantly higher average degree and betweenness than expected
      by chance, which provides additional support for the hypothesis that viruses
      preferentially target cellular proteins that occupy central position in the human
      protein interaction network. This study provides a valuable starting point for
      additional investigations into the roles of human proteins in DENV infection.

TI  - The kinase inhibitor SFV785 dislocates dengue virus envelope protein from the
      replication complex and blocks virus assembly.
PG  - e23246
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0023246 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the etiologic agent for dengue fever, for which there is
      no approved vaccine or specific anti-viral drug. As a remedy for this, we
      explored the use of compounds that interfere with the action of required host
      factors and describe here the characterization of a kinase inhibitor (SFV785),
      which has selective effects on NTRK1 and MAPKAPK5 kinase activity, and anti-viral
      activity on Hepatitis C, DENV and yellow fever viruses. SFV785 inhibited DENV
      propagation without inhibiting DENV RNA synthesis or translation. The compound
      did not cause any changes in the cellular distribution of non-structural 3, a
      protein critical for DENV RNA synthesis, but altered the distribution of the
      structural envelope protein from a reticulate network to enlarged discrete
      vesicles, which altered the co-localization with the DENV replication complex.
      Ultrastructural electron microscopy analyses of DENV-infected SFV785-treated
      cells showed the presence of viral particles that were distinctly different from 
      viable enveloped virions within enlarged ER cisternae. These viral particles were
      devoid of the dense nucleocapsid. The secretion of the viral particles was not
      inhibited by SFV785, however a reduction in the amount of secreted infectious
      virions, DENV RNA and capsid were observed. Collectively, these observations
      suggest that SFV785 inhibited the recruitment and assembly of the nucleocapsid in
      specific ER compartments during the DENV assembly process and hence the
      production of infectious DENV. SFV785 and derivative compounds could be useful
      biochemical probes to explore the DENV lifecycle and could also represent a new
      class of anti-virals.

TI  - Patterns of illness in travelers visiting Mexico and Central America: the
      GeoSentinel experience.
PG  - 523-31
LID - 10.1093/cid/cir468 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mexico and Central America are important travel destinations for
      North American and European travelers. There is limited information on regional
      differences in travel related morbidity. METHODS: We describe the morbidity among
      4779 ill travelers returned from Mexico and Central America who were evaluated at
      GeoSentinel network clinics during December 1996 to February 2010. RESULTS: The
      most frequent presenting syndromes included acute and chronic diarrhea,
      dermatologic diseases, febrile systemic illness, and respiratory disease. A
      higher proportion of ill travelers from the United States had acute diarrhea,
      compared with their Canadian and European counterparts (odds ratio, 1.9; P <
      .0001). During the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak from March 2009 through February 
      2010, the proportionate morbidity (PM) associated with respiratory illnesses in
      ill travelers increased among those returned from Mexico, compared with prior
      years (196.0 cases per 1000 ill returned travelers vs 53.7 cases per 1000 ill
      returned travelers; P < .0001); the PM remained constant in the rest of Central
      America (57.3 cases per 1000 ill returned travelers). We identified 50 travelers 
      returned from Mexico and Central America who developed influenza, including
      infection due to 2009 H1N1 strains and influenza-like illness. The overall risk
      of malaria was low; only 4 cases of malaria were acquired in Mexico (PM, 2.2
      cases per 1000 ill returned travelers) in 13 years, compared with 18 from
      Honduras (PM, 79.6 cases per 1000 ill returned travelers) and 14 from Guatemala
      (PM, 34.4 cases per 1000 ill returned travelers) during the same period.
      Plasmodium vivax malaria was the most frequent malaria diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS:
      Travel medicine practitioners advising and treating travelers visiting these
      regions should dedicate special attention to vaccine-preventable illnesses and
      should consider the uncommon occurrence of acute hepatitis A, leptospirosis,
      neurocysticercosis, acute Chagas disease, onchocerciasis, mucocutaneous
      leishmaniasis, neurocysticercosis, HIV, malaria, and brucellosis.

      humans. Here, the genetic relatedness among autochthonous DENV Mexican isolates
      was assessed. Phylogenetic and median-joining network analyses showed that viral 
      strains recovered from different geographic locations are genetically related and
      relatively homogeneous, exhibiting limited nucleotide diversity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dengue infection demonstrates a wide spectrum of clinical
      manifestations from mild disease (dengue fever) to severe dengue hemorrhagic
      fever, but the immunopathogenic mechanisms involved in disease severity are not
      clear. OBJECTIVE: Differentially expressed genes associated to immune response
      were identified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Colombian children
      with dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microarray
      analysis was used as a tool to establish and compare transcriptional profiles of 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells of six children in acute phase of dengue fever
      and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The commercial gene chip used was Affymnetrix
      GeneChip HG_U133_Plus_2. RESULTS: Dengue hemorrhagic fever patients expressed
      interleukin 6, chemokines, complement proteins and pentraxin 3, along with the
      lymphocyte inhibitors lymphocyte-activation gene 3 and cathepsin L1. An
      interaction model for these genes showed tissue factor playing a central role in 
      the network generated. In contrast, dengue fever patients expressed cytokines,
      complement and the leukotrienes inhibitors lactotransferrin, C1 inhibitor, and
      leukotriene-B (4-omega-hydroxylase 2). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that
      in dengue fever, cytokine and complement inhibitors are able to limit endothelial
      damage and prevent increases in vascular permeability, whereas dengue-
      hemorrhagic fever patients have immune cell dysfunction and unregulated
      complement and cytokine action. This leads to "hypercoagulation" and endothelial 
      damage, thereby increasing disease severity. Verification of the pathogenic role 
      of the identified molecules will contribute to understanding of dengue
      pathogenesis and lead to rational development of therapeutic drugs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is an increasingly significant arthropod-borne viral
      disease, with at least 50 million cases per year worldwide. As with other viral
      pathogens, dengue virus is dependent on its host to perform the bulk of functions
      necessary for viral survival and replication. To be successful, dengue must
      manipulate host cell biological processes towards its own ends, while avoiding
      elimination by the immune system. Protein-protein interactions between the virus 
      and its host are one avenue through which dengue can connect and exploit these
      host cellular pathways and processes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We
      implemented a computational approach to predict interactions between Dengue virus
      (DENV) and both of its hosts, Homo sapiens and the insect vector Aedes aegypti.
      Our approach is based on structural similarity between DENV and host proteins and
      incorporates knowledge from the literature to further support a subset of the
      predictions. We predict over 4,000 interactions between DENV and humans, as well 
      as 176 interactions between DENV and A. aegypti. Additional filtering based on
      shared Gene Ontology cellular component annotation reduced the number of
      predictions to approximately 2,000 for humans and 18 for A. aegypti. Of 19
      experimentally validated interactions between DENV and humans extracted from the 
      literature, this method was able to predict nearly half (9). Additional
      predictions suggest specific interactions between virus and host proteins
      relevant to interferon signaling, transcriptional regulation, stress, and the
      unfolded protein response. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Dengue virus manipulates
      cellular processes to its advantage through specific interactions with the host's
      protein interaction network. The interaction networks presented here provide a
      set of hypothesis for further experimental investigation into the DENV life cycle
      as well as potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus infection is a public health threat to hundreds of
      millions of individuals in the tropical regions of the globe. Although Dengue
      infection usually manifests itself in its mildest, though often debilitating
      clinical form, dengue fever, life-threatening complications commonly arise in the
      form of hemorrhagic shock and encephalitis. The etiological basis for the
      virus-induced pathology in general, and the different clinical manifestations in 
      particular, are not well understood. We reasoned that a detailed knowledge of the
      global biological processes affected by virus entry into a cell might help shed
      new light on this long-standing problem. METHODS: A bacterial two-hybrid screen
      using DENV2 structural proteins as bait was performed, and the results were used 
      to feed a manually curated, global dengue-human protein interaction network. Gene
      ontology and pathway enrichment, along with network topology and microarray
      meta-analysis, were used to generate hypothesis regarding dengue disease biology.
      RESULTS: Combining bioinformatic tools with two-hybrid technology, we screened
      human cDNA libraries to catalogue proteins physically interacting with the DENV2 
      virus structural proteins, Env, cap and PrM. We identified 31 interacting human
      proteins representing distinct biological processes that are closely related to
      the major clinical diagnostic feature of dengue infection: haemostatic imbalance.
      In addition, we found dengue-binding human proteins involved with additional key 
      aspects, previously described as fundamental for virus entry into cells and the
      innate immune response to infection. Construction of a DENV2-human global protein
      interaction network revealed interesting biological properties suggested by
      simple network topology analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our experimental strategy revealed
      that dengue structural proteins interact with human protein targets involved in
      the maintenance of blood coagulation and innate anti-viral response processes,
      and predicts that the interaction of dengue proteins with a proposed human
      protein interaction network produces a modified biological outcome that may be
      behind the hallmark pathologies of dengue infection.

AB  - Dengue fever, including dengue hemorrhagic fever, has become a re-emerging public
      health threat in the Caribbean in the absence of a comprehensive regional
      surveillance system. In this deficiency, a project entitled ARICABA, strives to
      implement a pilot surveillance system across three islands: Martinique, St.
      Lucia, and Dominica. The aim of this project is to establish a network for
      epidemiological surveillance of infectious diseases, utilizing information and
      communication technology. This paper describes the system design and development 
      strategies of a "network of networks" surveillance system for infectious diseases
      in the Caribbean. Also described are benefits, challenges, and limitations of
      this approach across the three island nations identified through direct
      observation, open-ended interviews, and email communications with an on-site IT
      consultant, key informants, and the project director. Identified core systems
      design of the ARICABA data warehouse include a disease monitoring system and a
      syndromic surveillance system. Three components comprise the development
      strategy: the data warehouse server, the geographical information system, and
      forecasting algorithms; these are recognized technical priorities of the
      surveillance system. A main benefit of the ARICABA surveillance system is
      improving responsiveness and representativeness of existing health systems
      through automated data collection, process, and transmission of information from 
      various sources. Challenges include overcoming technology gaps between countries;
      real-time data collection points; multiple language support; and
      "component-oriented" development approaches.

AB  - Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, St. Martin and St. Barthelemy were the
      French territories most exposed to the new influenza A(H1N1)v, and adequate
      epidemiological surveillance tools were promptly developed in order to detect its
      emergence. The first stage, "containment phase", consisted in detection and
      management of individual cases. Then, when an autochthonous A(H1N1)v circulation 
      was confirmed, its evolution has been monitored within the whole population,
      mainly through data collected from sentinel doctors' networks and virological
      surveillance. This allowed to detect very early the occurrence of epidemics, and 
      to follow their evolution until they were over. Like all the other Caribbean
      countries, the five French overseas territories were hit by an outbreak of
      influenza A(H1N1)v. Although they had globally similar characteristics, each
      epidemic had its specificity in terms of scale and severity. They started between
      August and September 2009 in four of the five territories, while the last one,
      St. Barthelemy, was not affected until the end of the year. Attack rate estimates
      varied from 28 to 70 per 1000 inhabitants according to the territory, and
      hospitalisation rate varied from 4.3 to 10.3 per 1000 cases. Severity rate didn't
      reach 1 per 1000 cases in any of the territories. Compared to metropolitan
      France, the surveillance system presented several strengths, including the
      pre-existence of both an active sentinel network and an expert committee on
      emerging diseases in each territory. On the other hand, specific difficulties
      appeared, notably linked with logistical aspects of virological surveillance and 
      the co-circulation of dengue virus in Guadeloupe and St. Barthelemy. Despite
      these difficulties, the different tools allowed early detection of the epidemics 
      and follow-up of their evolution. All of them lead to very concordant results,
      suggesting that they are completely appropriate to monitor a potential new
      epidemic wave.

TI  - The early whole-blood transcriptional signature of dengue virus and features
      associated with progression to dengue shock syndrome in Vietnamese children and
      young adults.
PG  - 12982-94
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01224-10 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a pantropic public health problem. In children, dengue shock syndrome
      (DSS) is the most common life-threatening complication. The ability to predict
      which patients may develop DSS may improve triage and treatment. To this end, we 
      conducted a nested case-control comparison of the early host transcriptional
      features in 24 DSS patients and 56 sex-, age-, and virus serotype-matched
      uncomplicated (UC) dengue patients. In the first instance, we defined the "early 
      dengue" profile. The transcriptional signature in acute rather than convalescent 
      samples (</=72 h post-illness onset) was defined by an overabundance of
      interferon-inducible transcripts (31% of the 551 overabundant transcripts) and
      canonical gene ontology terms that included the following: response to virus,
      immune response, innate immune response, and inflammatory response. Pathway and
      network analyses identified STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, IRF7, IRF9, IRF1, CEBPB, and SP1
      as key transcriptional factors mediating the early response. Strikingly, the only
      difference in the transcriptional signatures of early DSS and UC dengue cases was
      the greater abundance of several neutrophil-associated transcripts in patients
      who progressed to DSS, a finding supported by higher plasma concentrations of
      several canonical proteins associated with neutrophil degranulation
      (bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein [BPI], elastase 2 [ELA2], and
      defensin 1 alpha [DEF1A]). Elevated levels of neutrophil-associated transcripts
      were independent of the neutrophil count and also of the genotype of the
      infecting virus, as genome-length sequences of dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1)
      (n = 15) and DENV-2 (n = 3) sampled from DSS patients were phylogenetically
      indistinguishable from those sampled from uncomplicated dengue patients (32
      DENV-1 and 9 DENV-2 sequences). Collectively, these data suggest a hitherto
      unrecognized association between neutrophil activation, pathogenesis, and the
      development of DSS and point to future strategies for guiding prognosis.

TI  - [Operation to promote use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) in French
      Guiana in 2006: design, implementation and results].
PG  - 249-54
AB  - In 2006, the Regional Health Office (DSDS) in French Guiana undertook a major
      operation involving importation and distribution of long-lasting insecticide
      treated nets (LLIN/ITN). In collaboration with the WHO, a Vietnamese manufacturer
      of LLINs suited to the requirements of French Guiana was sourced. With the help
      of a dynamic local importer and dealer, a sales network was developed through
      chemist shops located all over French Guiana. This network provided wide coverage
      since these outlets can be found in all large communities. The selling price
      ranged from 15 to 23 euros depending on the model, i.e., hammock or bed size. In 
      addition, LLINs were distributed within the framework of two special programs.
      First they are given to women giving birth in French Guiana and undergoing
      medical surveillance as part of the Mother and Child Protection program by public
      healthcare system. Second they are distributed in case of natural disaster or
      other events that could lead to an increased risk of vector-borne outbreaks.
      Thanks to this operation, a total of 13,882 LLINs were delivered in French Guiana
      from July 2006 to December 2008. This milestone operation in the fight against
      malaria was made possible thanks to funding granted on a one-time basis after the
      outbreak of dengue in 2005-2006. The structure of this operation and its survival
      will depend on the continued goodwill and determination of a small group of local
      partners who created this successful distribution campaign with no specific
      guidance or program from the national authorities.

TI  - Neural network diagnostic system for dengue patients risk classification.
PG  - 661-76
LID - 10.1007/s10916-010-9532-x [doi]
AB  - With the dramatic increase of the worldwide threat of dengue disease, it has been
      very crucial to correctly diagnose the dengue patients in order to decrease the
      disease severity. However, it has been a great challenge for the physicians to
      identify the level of risk in dengue patients due to overlapping of the medical
      classification criteria. Therefore, this study aims to construct a noninvasive
      diagnostic system to assist the physicians for classifying the risk in dengue
      patients. Systematic producers have been followed to develop the system. Firstly,
      the assessment of the significant predictors associated with the level of risk in
      dengue patients was carried out utilizing the statistical analyses technique.
      Secondly, Multilayer perceptron neural network models trained via
      Levenberg-Marquardt and Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithms was employed for
      constructing the diagnostic system. Finally, precise tuning for the models'
      parameters was conducted in order to achieve the optimal performance. As a
      result, 9 noninvasive predictors were found to be significantly associated with
      the level of risk in dengue patients. By employing those predictors, 75%
      prediction accuracy has been achieved for classifying the risk in dengue patients
      using Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithm while 70.7% prediction accuracy were
      achieved by using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

TI  - Non-invasive diagnosis of risk in dengue patients using bioelectrical impedance
      analysis and artificial neural network.
PG  - 1141-8
LID - 10.1007/s11517-010-0669-z [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a new approach to diagnose and classify early risk in dengue 
      patients using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and artificial neural
      network (ANN). A total of 223 healthy subjects and 207 hospitalized dengue
      patients were prospectively studied. The dengue risk severity criteria was
      determined and grouped based on three blood investigations, namely, platelet
      (PLT) count (less than or equal to 30,000 cells per mm(3)), hematocrit (HCT)
      (increase by more than or equal to 20%), and either aspartate aminotransferase
      (AST) level (raised by fivefold the normal upper limit) or alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) level (raised by fivefold the normal upper limit). The
      dengue patients were classified according to their risk groups and the
      corresponding BIA parameters were subsequently obtained and quantified. Four
      parameters were used for training and testing the ANN which are day of fever,
      reactance, gender, and risk group's quantification. Day of fever was defined as
      the day of fever subsided, i.e., when the body temperature fell below 37.5
      degrees C. The blood investigation and the BIA data were taken for 5 days. The
      ANN was trained via the steepest descent back propagation with momentum algorithm
      using the log-sigmoid transfer function while the sum-squared error was used as
      the network's performance indicator. The best ANN architecture of 3-6-1 (3
      inputs, 6 neurons in the hidden layer, and 1 output), learning rate of 0.1,
      momentum constant of 0.2, and iteration rate of 20,000 was pruned using a
      weight-eliminating method. Eliminating a weight of 0.05 enhances the dengue's
      prediction risk classification accuracy of 95.88% for high risk and 96.83% for
      low risk groups. As a result, the system is able to classify and diagnose the
      risk in the dengue patients with an overall prediction accuracy of 96.27%.

PG  - 380
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-11-380 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two fifths of the world's population is at risk from dengue. The
      absence of effective drugs and vaccines leaves vector control as the primary
      intervention tool. Understanding dengue virus (DENV) host interactions is
      essential for the development of novel control strategies. The availability of
      genome sequences for both human and mosquito host greatly facilitates genome-wide
      studies of DENV-host interactions. RESULTS: We developed the first draft of the
      mosquito protein interaction network using a computational approach. The weighted
      network includes 4,214 Aedes aegypti proteins with 10,209 interactions, among
      which 3,500 proteins are connected into an interconnected scale-free network. We 
      demonstrated the application of this network for the further annotation of
      mosquito proteins and dissection of pathway crosstalk. Using three datasets based
      on physical interaction assays, genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens and
      microarray assays, we identified 714 putative DENV-associated mosquito proteins. 
      An integrated analysis of these proteins in the network highlighted four regions 
      consisting of highly interconnected proteins with closely related functions in
      each of replication/transcription/translation (RTT), immunity, transport and
      metabolism. Putative DENV-associated proteins were further selected for
      validation by RNAi-mediated gene silencing, and dengue viral titer in mosquito
      midguts was significantly reduced for five out of ten (50.0%) randomly selected
      genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the presence of common host requirements
      for DENV in mosquitoes and humans. We discuss the significance of our findings
      for pharmacological intervention and genetic modification of mosquitoes for
      blocking dengue transmission.

TI  - Intrinsic disorder in the core proteins of flaviviruses.
PG  - 1019-25
AB  - Hepatitis C virus and related viruses in the Flaviviridae family (such as dengue 
      virus, yellow fever virus or West Nile virus) are amongst the most important
      human pathogens, causing substantial morbidity and mortality world-wide. The
      production of viral progeny in Flaviviridae is orchestrated by the small,
      multifunctional core protein, which coats and condenses the viral genomic RNA
      during Nucleocapsid formation. In addition to their structural role, mounting
      experimental evidence links core proteins to viral persistence and pathogenesis, 
      by virtue of their promiscuous interactions with host cell factors. In this
      review, we summarize the present knowledge about the structure of Flaviviridae
      core proteins and discuss the importance of flexible, intrinsically unstructured 
      protein regions in viral assembly and hub formation in the virus-host
      protein-protein interaction network (infection network).

TI  - Operational vector-borne disease surveillance and control: closing the
      capabilities gap through research at overseas military laboratories.
PG  - 16-27
AB  - Malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya virus, leishmaniasis, and a myriad of other
      vector-borne diseases pose significant threats to the warfighter and to the
      overall combat effectiveness of units. Military preventive medicine (PM) assets
      must accurately evaluate the vector-borne disease threat and then implement
      and/or advise the commander on countermeasures to reduce a particular threat. The
      success of these measures is contingent upon the biology of the disease vector
      and on the tools or methods used to conduct vector/pathogen surveillance and
      vector control. There is a significant gap between the tools available and those 
      required for operational PM assets to provide real-time, effective surveillance
      and control. A network of US Army and US Navy overseas laboratories is focused on
      closing the current capabilities gap. Their mission is to develop and field test 
      tools and methods to enhance the combatant commander's ability to identify and
      mitigate the threat posed by these vector-borne diseases.

TI  - Two different routes of colonization of Aedes aegypti in Argentina from
      neighboring countries.
PG  - 1344-54
AB  - Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera, Culicidae) is the main vector of dengue and yellow
      fever. In Argentina, the species was apparently eradicated approximately in 1964;
      by 1986, it was reintroduced. To identify different gene pools in geographical
      populations of the species and to ascertain the possible routes of colonization, 
      we analyzed the diversity of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in 572 specimens from
      Argentina and neighboring countries. We found that the restriction fragment
      length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction screening of a large DNA fragment
      including the A+T-rich region was the best strategy to reconstruct the
      colonization pattern ofAe. aegypti in Argentina. Twenty haplotypes were
      recognized; levels of genetic similarity varied among populations from different 
      geographical locations. The haplotype network constructed on the basis of genetic
      distances showed three well differentiated groups. Two of them exhibited a well
      defined spatial distribution and populations in these groups presented an
      isolation-by-distance pattern. The persistence of relictual populations after the
      last eradication campaigns would explain the high levels of haplotype diversity
      and the presence of exclusive haplotypes in urban centers from northwestern
      Argentina. Eastern Argentine populations showed one prevalent haplotype, also
      predominant in Brazil and Paraguay. Our results highlight the need for efficient 
      surveys and control campaigns, given the strong effect of land trade on genetic
      exchange among mosquito populations from Argentina and neighboring countries
      where dengue is endemic.

TI  - Association of the pr peptides with dengue virus at acidic pH blocks membrane
      fusion.
PG  - 12101-7
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01637-09 [doi]
AB  - Flavivirus assembles into an inert particle that requires proteolytic activation 
      by furin to enable transmission to other hosts. We previously showed that
      immature virus undergoes a conformational change at low pH that renders it
      accessible to furin (I. M. Yu, W. Zhang, H. A. Holdaway, L. Li, V. A.
      Kostyuchenko, P. R. Chipman, R. J. Kuhn, M. G. Rossmann, and J. Chen, Science
      319:1834-1837, 2008). Here we show, using cryoelectron microscopy, that the
      structure of immature dengue virus at pH 6.0 is essentially the same before and
      after the cleavage of prM. The structure shows that after cleavage, the
      proteolytic product pr remains associated with the virion at acidic pH, and that 
      furin cleavage by itself does not induce any major conformational changes. We
      also show by liposome cofloatation experiments that pr retention prevents
      membrane insertion, suggesting that pr is present on the virion in the
      trans-Golgi network to protect the progeny virus from fusion within the host
      cell.

TI  - An analysis of a short-lived outbreak of dengue fever in Mauritius.
LID - 19314 [pii]
AB  - During the month of June 2009, Mauritius experienced a short-lived outbreak of
      dengue fever localised in its capital city Port Louis. Aedes albopictus, a
      secondary vector of dengue viruses, was the probable vector. We introduce a
      method which combines Google Earth images, stochastic cellular automata and scale
      free network ideas to map this outbreak. The method could complement other
      techniques to forecast the evolution of potential localised mosquito-borne viral 
      outbreaks in Mauritius and in at-risk locations elsewhere for public health
      planning purposes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the dengue epidemic in relation to the socioeconomic
      context according to geographical areas. METHODS: An ecological study was
      conducted in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro (Southeastern Brazil), in areas
      delimited as neighborhoods, based on information about notified dengue cases
      concerning residents in the municipality. The average incidence rate of dengue
      was calculated between the epidemiological weeks: 48th of 2001 and 20th of 2002. 
      The occurrence of dengue was correlated with socioeconomic variables through
      Pearsons' correlation coefficient. Moran's global and local indexes were used to 
      assess the spatial auto-correlation between dengue and the variables that
      significantly correlated with the disease. The multiple linear regression model
      and the conditional auto-regression spatial model were used to analyze the
      relationship between dengue and socioeconomic context. RESULTS: The neighborhoods
      located in the west zone of the municipality presented high rates of average
      dengue incidence. The variables presenting significant correlation were:
      percentage of households connected with the general sanitary network, households 
      with washing machines, and population density per urban area. Moran's spatial
      auto-correlation index revealed spatial dependence between dengue and the
      selected variables. The utilized models indicated percentage of households
      connected with the general sanitary network as the sole variable significantly
      associated with the disease. The residual figures in both models revealed
      significant spatial auto-correlation, with a positive Moran Index (p<0.001) for
      linear regression model, and a negative one (p=0.005) for the conditional
      auto-regression one. CONCLUSIONS: Problems related to basic sanitation contribute
      decisively to increase the risk of the disease.

PG  - 575-82
LID - 10.1097/MBC.0b013e32832fb1cf [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne human viral pathogen that has recently become a 
      major public health concern particularly in tropical and subtropical countries,
      predominantly in urban and periurban areas. Plasma from five patients infected by
      the virus was selected since they have in different degrees prolonged thrombin
      times: +2.1, +3.4, +5.7, +7.1 and +18.5 s, like a transitory acquired
      dysfibrinogenemia. The serotype could be determined in only two patients, being
      DEN-1 and DEN-3. The fibrinogen concentration was normal ranging from 2.5 to 3.2 
      g/l. In general, the fibrin degradation products of the patients were high,
      reaching values of 6000 ng/ml. The polymerization process was quite similar to
      that of the control, except in two cases where the final turbidity was almost
      half the control value. In one of these patients, the fibrinogen was purified and
      mixed with normal fibrinogen (v: v); the patients' fibrinogen impaired normal
      fibrin polymerization. Studies of the fibrinolytic process revealed that clots
      from dengue patients started to lyze before they have reached the maximum
      turbidity, although this was not reflected in the time needed for complete clot
      dissolution, which was similar to that of the control for all the patients.
      Fibrinolysis of clots made by mixing normal and patient purified fibrinogen (2.5:
      1) was impaired. Clot images obtained by scanning electron microscopy showed that
      the patients' fibrin network had some degree of degradation and the fibers were
      thicker than those of the control (P < 0.05). This preliminary study seems to
      indicate that the dengue virus infection modifies the balance of
      coagulation-fibrinolysis toward hyperfibrinolysis and could modify the normal
      fibrinogen molecule.

PG  - 42-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of imported cases of
      dengue fever in Guangdong province (GD) and in Hong Kong (HK) during 2004-2006 to
      provide evidence for further cooperation in the prevention and control programs
      on dengue fever in the two places. METHODS: Descriptive statistical analysis was 
      performed on data obtained from dengue fever surveillance and reporting network
      in GD and from Centre for Health Protection, Department of Health, HK. RESULTS:
      Both from GD and HK 44 and 93 imported cases of Dengue fever were reported during
      2004-2006. Most patients from GD acquired their infection from Singapore (13
      cases), Indonesia (9 cases) or Cambodia (6 cases) while patients in HK mainly
      were imported from Indonesia (31 cases), the Philippines (16 cases) and Thailand 
      (15 cases). The peak seasons of the two places were both from July to September. 
      During the non-peak season period, the number of cases in Hong Kong was higher
      than that in Guangdong. Male/ female ratio was 1.2:1 in GD and 1.1:1 in HK. Age
      of patients in GD appeared to range from 6-80 years, with 63.6% (28/44) of them
      aged 20-39 years. 40.9% (18/44) of the cases were engaged in business, services, 
      housework or unemployed. Those cases in HK were between 10-72 years of age, with 
      63.6% (28/ 44) of them aged 20-39 years while 47.3% (44/93) of the patients were 
      with the occupation of business, services and industry. More cases in GD had a
      onset of disease before entering the border (27:17) than the cases in HK (35:57).
      The average time interval between onset and diagnosis were 7 and 9 days for GD
      and HK respectively. CONCLUSION: Frequent travel between Southeast Asia in summer
      among the working class appeared to be the main factor, causing imported cases of
      dengue fever in GD and HK. It is crucial to provide health education targeted at 
      these high risk groups in order to prevent importation of dengue fever in the two
      areas.

AB  - Positive-strand RNA viruses are known to rearrange cellular membranes to
      facilitate viral genome replication. The biogenesis and three-dimensional
      organization of these membranes and the link between replication and virus
      assembly sites is not fully clear. Using electron microscopy, we find Dengue
      virus (DENV)-induced vesicles, convoluted membranes, and virus particles to be
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived, and we detect double-stranded RNA, a presumed
      marker of RNA replication, inside virus-induced vesicles. Electron tomography
      (ET) shows DENV-induced membrane structures to be part of one ER-derived network.
      Furthermore, ET reveals vesicle pores that could enable release of newly
      synthesized viral RNA and reveals budding of DENV particles on ER membranes
      directly apposed to vesicle pores. Thus, DENV modifies ER membrane structure to
      promote replication and efficient encapsidation of the genome into progeny virus.
      This architecture of DENV replication and assembly sites could explain the
      coordination of distinct steps of the flavivirus replication cycle.

TI  - Characterization of dengue complex-reactive epitopes on dengue 3 virus envelope
      protein domain III.
PG  - 16-20
LID - 10.1016/j.virol.2008.11.013 [doi]
AB  - The disease dengue (DEN) is caused by four genetically and serologically related 
      viruses termed DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4. The DENV envelope (E) protein ectodomain
      can be divided into three structural domains designated ED1, ED2, and ED3. The
      ED3 contains the DENV type-specific and DENV complex-reactive (epitopes shared by
      DENV 1-4) antigenic sites. In this study the epitopes recognized by four DENV
      complex-reactive monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with neutralizing activity were
      mapped on the DENV-3 ED3 using a combination of physical and biological
      techniques. Amino acid residues L306, K308, G381, I387, and W389 were critical
      for all four MAbs, with residues V305, E309, V310, K325, D382, A384, K386, and
      R391 being critical for various subsets of the MAbs. A previous study by our
      group (Gromowski, G.D., Barrett, N.D., Barrett, A.D., 2008. Characterization of
      dengue complex-specific neutralizing epitopes on the envelope protein domain III 
      of dengue 2 virus. J. Virol 82, 8828-8837) characterized the same panel of MAbs
      with DENV-2. The location of the DENV complex-reactive antigenic site on the
      DENV-2 and DENV-3 ED3s is similar; however, the critical residues for binding are
      not identical. Overall, this indicates that the DENV complex-reactive antigenic
      site on ED3 may be similar in location, but the surprising result is that DENV 2 
      and 3 exhibit unique sets of residues defining the energetics of interaction to
      the same panel of MAbs. These results imply that the amino acid sequences of DENV
      define a unique interaction network among these residues in spite of the fact
      that all flavivirus ED3s to date assume the same structural fold.

AB  - We examined seasonality and annual trends for dengue cases among 522 returned
      travelers reported to the international GeoSentinel Surveillance Network. Dengue 
      cases showed region-specific peaks for Southeast Asia (June, September), South
      Central Asia (October), South America (March), and the Caribbean (August,
      October). Travel-related dengue exhibited annual oscillations with several
      epidemics occurring during the study period. In Southeast Asia, annual
      proportionate morbidity increased from 50 dengue cases per 1,000 ill returned
      travelers in nonepidemic years to an average of 159 cases per 1,000 travelers
      during epidemic years. Dengue can thus be added to the list of diseases for which
      pretravel advice should include information on relative risk according to season.
      Also, dengue cases detected at atypical times in sentinel travelers may inform
      the international community of the onset of epidemic activity in specific areas.

      Committee annual report, 2006-07.

AB  - This report describes the epidemiology of mosquito-borne disease in Australia for
      the mosquito-borne disease season 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007, which was
      moderately low compared to previous seasons. Ross River virus (RRV) infections
      (55%), Barmah Forest virus (BFV) infections (29%) and overseas acquired malaria
      (11%) were the most common mosquito-borne diseases reported in 2006-07. The
      number, proportion and rate of national BFV notifications were the second highest
      on record since 1998-99. The Northern Territory reported the highest BFV
      notification rate this season. BFV notification rates were the highest in the
      40-59 year age groups when compared to other age groups. The number, proportion
      and rate of RRV notifications were moderately low this season compared with
      previous seasons. The highest RRV rate was reported by Western Australia from the
      Kimberley region. The highest age-specific RRV notification rate was observed in 
      the 40-59 year age groups. Locally acquired dengue virus notifications were low
      this season compared to previous seasons, with a small outbreak of dengue
      serotype 3 in 39 cases confined to the greater Townsville region. There were 640 
      notifications of malaria in 2006-07 of which none were reported as locally
      acquired. This was the third highest number of malaria notifications since 2001. 
      Plasmodium falciparum was reported as the infecting species in 47% of the malaria
      notifications and Plasmodium vivax for 40% of cases. Young adolescents and adults
      in the 15-29 year age group had the highest number of cases accounting for 32% of
      notifications. Sentinel chicken surveillance data for flaviviruses and sentinel
      pig surveillance data for Japanese encephalitis virus are also reported.

TI  - Structure of the immature dengue virus at low pH primes proteolytic maturation.
PG  - 1834-7
LID - 10.1126/science.1153264 [doi]
AB  - Intracellular cleavage of immature flaviviruses is a critical step in assembly
      that generates the membrane fusion potential of the E glycoprotein. With
      cryo-electron microscopy we show that the immature dengue particles undergo a
      reversible conformational change at low pH that renders them accessible to furin 
      cleavage. At a pH of 6.0, the E proteins are arranged in a herringbone pattern
      with the pr peptides docked onto the fusion loops, a configuration similar to
      that of the mature virion. After cleavage, the dissociation of pr is
      pH-dependent, suggesting that in the acidic environment of the trans-Golgi
      network pr is retained on the virion to prevent membrane fusion. These results
      suggest a mechanism by which flaviviruses are processed and stabilized in the
      host cell secretory pathway.

TI  - [Electronic transmission of epidemiologic data and monitoring of the chikungunya 
      virus epidemic in Reunion Island, 2006].
PG  - 593-9
LID - 10.1016/j.lpm.2007.12.006 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: When the first cases of the 2005-2006 chikungunya epidemic struck
      Reunion Island, local health authorities set up an island-wide operational
      epidemiologic surveillance system for these infections. This system relied on
      vector control teams, which conducted active case-finding around the reported
      cases, and on a sentinel physician network. In addition, in March 2006, the
      Sephira and Reunion-Telecom companies, in partnership with the Reunion-Mayotte
      interregional epidemiology bureau (CIRE), developed an innovative system of
      epidemiologic monitoring by electronic data transmission. METHODS: This system
      relied on the participation of volunteer physicians who transmitted epidemiologic
      data through the data terminals used for the transmission of electronic treatment
      forms to the health insurance funds. Using the patient's insurance identification
      card, each physician provided information about consultations related to
      chikungunya. This information was transmitted, via the Sephira server in France
      to Reunion-Telecom, which processed, aggregated and transmitted these data weekly
      to the CIRE. This network was separate from and independent of the sentinel
      physician network, RESULTS: In all, 44 physicians, accounting for 6% of the
      general practitioners in Reunion, participated in this system, which went into
      operation during week 14 of 2006. The data collected allowed an assessment of the
      trends in the epidemic incidence rate by calculating the percentage of
      consultations related to chikungunya among all consultations (office visits and
      house calls). For weeks 14-26 of 2006, when the epidemic transmission had spread 
      across the entire island, the Reunion-Telecom health network data proved to be
      closely correlated with the results of the sentinel physician network
      surveillance system used to monitor the epidemic trends (correlation
      coefficient=0.97). CONCLUSION: The system provided very encouraging results in
      monitoring disease time trends in a period of massive epidemic. Its simplicity of
      use and the speed of data transmission are undeniable assets for its future
      development. Because it offers the possibility of monitoring other diseases with 
      epidemic potential, such as dengue and influenza, it opens new prospects for
      infectious disease surveillance.

TI  - Dengue in the Pacific--an update of the current situation.
PG  - 111-9
AB  - Dengue continues to be a threat to Pacific Island countries and territories
      (PICTs). The last DEN-1 epidemic reached 16 PICTs and in some of them it affected
      as much as 20 per cent of the population, aside from the massive impact on their 
      fragile economies. Dengue is mostly introduced into PICTs from global travel, and
      many experts believe that it has a 3-4 year cyclical pattern of occurrence. All
      four virus serotypes (DEN-1, 2, 3 and 4) have caused epidemics, but those caused 
      by DEN-1 and 2 have been somewhat larger. In light of this, dengue rightly
      remains a priority for the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network (PPHSN).
      The paper updates the situation regarding dengue outbreaks in PICTs over the last
      four decades, describes the pattern of presentations in the recent past, and
      provides an update on the potential risk to PICTs for the near future. It follows
      on from an earlier dengue update written in 1998. The utility of PPHSN services
      is also demonstrated in the paper: PacNet for alerts and communication about
      dengue outbreaks (raising awareness and preparedness levels in the region) and
      LabNet for investigations relating to dengue. Creative interventions towards
      dengue control and prevention are being tried in PICTs and early assessment and
      evaluations of their effectiveness in the field are being examined.

TI  - An outbreak of dengue fever in Yap State.
PG  - 99-102
AB  - Between May and December 2004,Yap State experienced an outbreak of Dengue Fever, 
      type 1 with a final total of 658 recorded clinically compatible cases, including 
      42 hospitalisations and 12 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome.
      There were no fatalities. Lessons learned from this outbreak include: the
      importance maintaining a high index of suspicion and on-site diagnostic
      capability for dengue fever, the importance of prompt in-service training for
      health care workers, the danger posed to neighbors by local lapses in outbreak
      prone disease surveillance and the utility of the Pacific Public Health
      Surveillance Network in responding to such diseases, the importance of active
      disease surveillance in outer island populations, and the importance of
      instituting preventive measures against the nosocomial spread of dengue fever.

TI  - Laboratory-based dengue fever surveillance in Tamil Nadu, India.
PG  - 112-5
AB  - Dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) have become a serious public 
      health problem in many parts of India in recent years. Several vertical national 
      programmes for communicable diseases, which include vector-borne diseases such as
      malaria and filariasis have been in operation for over five decades in India. The
      remarkable increase in dengue fever and DHF related deaths during the last decade
      has necessitated an effective surveillance system to detect the cases and adopt
      appropriate control measures against dengue vectors. Although the existence of
      all the four serotypes of dengue virus was proved as early as in 1960s, it was
      only after 1990, several outbreaks of DF/DHF were reported in Tamil Nadu.
      Further, dengue, once considered as urban problem has now penetrated into rural
      areas also, due to various changes in the environment. The geographic spread,
      increase in number of cases, reporting system, laboratory diagnosis, monitoring
      of vector density and investigation of outbreaks in Tamil Nadu during the last
      decade are comprehensively documented and discussed here to further strengthen
      the surveillance network to prevent possible major outbreaks of DF/DHF.

TI  - Critical behavior of the contact process in a multiscale network.
PG  - 036112
AB  - Inspired by dengue and yellow fever epidemics, we investigated the contact
      process (CP) in a multiscale network constituted by one-dimensional chains
      connected through a Barabasi-Albert scale-free network. In addition to the CP
      dynamics inside the chains, the exchange of individuals between connected chains 
      (travels) occurs at a constant rate. A finite epidemic threshold and an epidemic 
      mean lifetime diverging exponentially in the subcritical phase, concomitantly
      with a power law divergence of the outbreak's duration, were found. A generalized
      scaling function involving both regular and SF components was proposed for the
      quasistationary analysis and the associated critical exponents determined,
      demonstrating that the CP on this hybrid network and nonvanishing travel rates
      establishes a new universality class.

TI  - [Human leptospirosis in French Polynesia. Epidemiological, clinical and
      bacteriological features].
PG  - 137-44
AB  - Leptospirosis is a severe zoonotic disease that constitutes a major public health
      problem for the island populations of French Polynesia. Due to protean clinical
      manifestations and the risk of misdiagnosis with dengue fever, endemic viral
      disease, laboratory studies are necessary to confirm diagnosis of leptospirosis. 
      At the request of the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network, a prospective
      study was conducted in the population of Raieatea in the Windward Islands and the
      Marquis Islands to determine the epidemiological features of the disease and to
      define appropriate control measures. A total of 113 patients were enrolled in
      study between March 2004 and March 2005. Thirty-three cases were confirmed based 
      on demonstration of serum DNA or seroconversion. The estimated annual incidence
      of leptospirosis was 1.7 per 1000 inhabitants. Cases involved mainly (75%) young 
      men (mean age, 30.5 years) and occurred predominantly during the rainy season.
      Swimming in fresh water was the only factor showing significant correlation (p < 
      0.02) with positive diagnosis of leptospirosis. The most frequently identified
      serotype was Leptospira icterohemorrahgiae (43% of strains), thus suggesting that
      the rat was the most common human transmission vector. However other serotypes
      were found, underlining the presence of diverse reservoirs and casting doubt on
      the efficacy of immunization using a monovalent vaccine. These findings also
      indicate that enhancement of prevention and control measures for leptospirosis is
      needed.

TI  - Low gene flow of Aedes aegypti between dengue-endemic and dengue-free areas in
      southeastern and southern Brazil.
PG  - 303-9
AB  - We present a population genetic study of Aedes aegypti in Brazil using isoenzyme 
      markers. Four polymorphic loci were used to examine 11 mosquito collections at
      four periods in 2003. Samples from a dengue-endemic area (southeastern region)
      and a dengue-free area (southern region) connected by an important network of
      roads and railways were analyzed. The degree of genetic differentiation observed 
      between populations is consistent with limited gene flow between them. There was 
      no evidence of passive dispersion of Ae. aegypti by vehicles among the different 
      routes linking metropolitan areas.

TI  - Structure of immature West Nile virus.
PG  - 6141-5
AB  - The structure of immature West Nile virus particles, propagated in the presence
      of ammonium chloride to block virus maturation in the low-pH environment of the
      trans-Golgi network, was determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The
      structure of these particles was similar to that of immature West Nile virus
      particles found as a minor component of mature virus samples (naturally occurring
      immature particles [NOIPs]). The structures of mature infectious flaviviruses are
      radically different from those of the immature particles. The similarity of the
      ammonium chloride-treated particles and NOIPs suggests either that the NOIPs have
      not undergone any conformational change during maturation or that the
      conformational change is reversible. Comparison with the cryo-EM reconstruction
      of immature dengue virus established the locations of the N-linked glycosylation 
      sites of these viruses, verifying the interpretation of the reconstructions of
      the immature flaviviruses.

TI  - Severe dengue virus infection in travelers: risk factors and laboratory
      indicators.
PG  - 1089-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is the most common arboviral disease in travelers. In
      countries where dengue virus is endemic, sequential (secondary) infections with
      different dengue virus serotypes are associated with disease severity. Data on
      severity and secondary infection rates in a population of travelers are lacking. 
      METHODS: Intensified surveillance of dengue fever in travelers was performed
      within the European Network on Surveillance of Imported Infectious Diseases. Data
      were collected at 14 European clinical referral centers between 2003 and 2005.
      RESULTS: A total of 219 dengue virus infections imported from various regions of 
      endemicity were reported. Serological analysis revealed a secondary immune
      response in 17%. Spontaneous bleeding was observed in 17 (8%) patients and was
      associated with increased serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels and
      lower median platelet counts. Two (0.9%) patients fulfilled the World Health
      Organization (WHO) case definition for dengue hemorrhagic fever. However, 23
      (11%) travelers had severe clinical manifestations (internal hemorrhage, plasma
      leakage, shock, or marked thrombocytopenia). A secondary immune response was
      significantly associated with both spontaneous bleeding and other severe clinical
      manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: In travelers, severe dengue virus infections are not
      uncommon but may be missed if the WHO classification is strictly applied. High
      liver enzyme levels and low platelet counts could serve as indicators of disease 
      severity.

      Committee annual report, 2005-06.
PG  - 411-29
AB  - This report describes the epidemiology of mosquito-borne disease in Australia for
      the mosquito-borne disease season 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, in which the
      second largest number of notifications since 1995-96 was reported. Ross River
      virus (RRV) infections (66%), Barmah Forest virus (BFV) infections (23%) and
      malaria (9%) were the most common mosquito-borne diseases reported in 2005-06.
      National RRV notifications were the fifth largest on record. The Northern
      Territory had the highest rate of RRV notifications and the peak notification
      rate (in January 2006) was the third highest since 2000. National BFV
      notification rates were the highest on record. The Northern Territory also
      reported the highest BFV notification rate this season, peaking in February-March
      2006, which was the highest reported BFV notification rate on record. BFV
      notification rates were significantly higher in teenagers compared to previous
      seasons. There were 731 notifications of malaria in 2005-06 of which none was
      reported as locally acquired. This was the third highest reporting period for
      malaria notifications since 2000. In contrast to previous years in which
      Plasmodium vivax was the predominant species, Plasmodium falciparum was reported 
      as the infecting species in 45 per cent of the malaria notifications and
      Plasmodium vivax for 42 per cent of cases. Young adults in the 20-24 year age
      group had the highest number of cases and children in the 5-9 year age group
      accounted for 22 per cent of notifications. There were two cases of Kunjin virus 
      (KUNV) infection and one case of Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV)
      infection reported in 2005-06, all from Western Australia. Sentinel chicken
      surveillance data for flaviviruses and sentinel pig surveillance data for
      Japanese encephalitis virus are reported. There were 200 notifications of dengue 
      virus (DENV) infection in 2005-06, of which 46 per cent (n = 92) was reported as 
      having been acquired overseas. Dengue serotypes 2 and 3 were detected in two
      outbreaks of locally-acquired dengue in Queensland this season.

TI  - Aedes aegypti survival and dengue transmission patterns in French Guiana.
PG  - 390-9
AB  - Field survival of Aedes aegypti females is a key parameter for estimating the
      dengue transmission potential of a mosquito population. The objectives of this
      study were to explore the dynamics of these survival rates at different times of 
      the year in French Guiana and to analyze the results from the perspective of
      dengue patterns. The mosquitoes were captured, marked, released, and recaptured
      during four consecutive days in six houses every month, for three to 24 months,
      from January 1997 to December 1998. Laboratory experiments showed no effects on
      female survival but some effect on the survival of males. Females' daily survival
      in the field varied from 0.525 to 1 but was mostly between 0.8 and 0.95 during
      the entire year, with a mean value of 0.913. The field survival of Ae. aegypti
      females in French Guiana was thus in agreement with the likely transmission of
      dengue and the dengue endemic patterns throughout the year. On the other hand,
      heavy rainfalls during this time were less favorable to Ae. aegypti survival,
      which may explain part of the El Nino effect on dengue epidemics in French
      Guiana. The methods and results on Ae. aegypti survival will be implemented in a 
      global dengue surveillance network in French Guiana.

TI  - Learning together: a Canada-Cuba research collaboration to improve the
      sustainable management of environmental health risks.
PG  - 50-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To build a national Cuban capacity for training environmental health
      professionals directly linked to the needs of policy-makers and communities.
      PARTICIPANTS: The University of Manitoba and University of British Columbia
      collaborated with an established training centre in Cuba (the Instituto Nacional 
      de Higiene y Epidemiologia--INHEM) and new centres in the Central (Santa Clara)
      and Eastern (Santiago) regions of the country. SETTING: Cuba. INTERVENTION: In
      the mid-1990s, a comprehensive curriculum (masters and diploma programs) was
      collaboratively developed, applying interactive teaching methods, and was
      delivered through a series of workshops and other interactions in Cuba, and
      short-term visits to Canada by Cuban PhD students. OUTCOMES: The collaboration
      was successful in fulfilling capacity-building targets (over 50 Masters
      graduates, 467 Diploma graduates, over 30 trained core faculty in all regional
      centres as well as new curriculum and new accredited regional programs).
      Alongside this, a number of collaborative community-based research projects were 
      undertaken in all three regions (drinking water in Santiago; housing and urban
      renewal, and dengue control in Havana; and tourism-related effects, and effective
      intersectoral management of population health determinants in Santa Clara).
      CONCLUSION: The collaboration led to adopting new strategies for challenges such 
      as a dengue epidemic in 2002, and new research on the effectiveness of
      intersectoral management of risks of particular interest to both Cuban and
      Canadian policy-makers. It triggered an ambitious collaboration between the
      Canadian-Cuban team and colleagues in Ecuador in order to build a similar
      national network there, built on South-South and North-South links.

PG  - 341-57
AB  - This report describes the epidemiology of mosquito-borne disease in Australia for
      the mosquito-borne disease season 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005. Ross River virus
      (RRV) infections (45%), Barmah Forest virus (BFV) infections (30%) and malaria
      (19%) were the most common mosquito-borne diseases reported in 2004-05. The
      Northern Territory had the highest rate of RRV notifications and the peak
      notification rate (in February 2005) was 54 per cent less than the previous
      season. The Northern Territory also reported the highest BFV notification rate
      this season, peaking in April 2005, which was the second highest reported BFV
      notification rate since 1998. National RRV and BFV notification rates were
      highest in the 45-49 year age group. There were 799 notifications of malaria in
      2004-05 of which none were reported as locally acquired. This was the third
      highest reporting season for malaria notifications since 1998. In contrast to
      previous years in which Plasmodium vivax was the predominant species, Plasmodium 
      falciparum was reported as the infecting species in 57 per cent of the malaria
      notifications and Plasmodium vivax for 34 per cent of cases. Children in the 5-9 
      year age group had the highest number of cases compared to previous years in
      which the peak number of cases tended to be in young adult age groups. There were
      four cases of Kunjin virus (KUNV) and two cases of Murray Valley encephalitis
      virus (MVEV) reported in 2004-05. Sentinel chicken surveillance data for
      flaviviruses and sentinel pig surveillance data for Japanese encephalitis virus
      are reported. There were 188 notifications of dengue virus infection (DENV) in
      2004-05, of which 46 per cent (n=86) were reported as having been acquired
      overseas. Dengue serotype 4 was the most frequently reported type, accounting for
      32 per cent of cases (n=60).

AB  - In order to address the vitality of the microbial world, to detect emerging
      infectious diseases, to determine their potential threat to public health, and to
      establish effective interventions, the World Health Organization (WHO) has
      developed and coordinates the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) 
      which connects several surveillance networks. Some of these networks are specific
      to epidemic-prone diseases, such as influenza, dengue, yellow fever or
      meningitis. Others were especially designed to track unusual events--such as the 
      emergence of SARS--that are naturally-occurring, accidental, or deliberately
      created (biological weapons, bio-terrorism). Lastly, a special effort is being
      made at the international level to modernize the International Health
      Regulations, now obsolete, and to support all the countries in the reinforcement 
      of their outbreak alert and response capacity.

TI  - Quality assurance for the diagnostics of viral diseases to enhance the emergency 
      preparedness in Europe.
PG  - 102-6
AB  - The threat posed by emerging and re-emerging communicable diseases and, more
      recently, by the intentional release of infectious agents in a susceptible
      population, has been receiving considerable attention at the national and
      international levels. Public health efforts to strengthen disease detection,
      surveillance and control have been intensified. However, clinicians and clinical 
      microbiology laboratories play an important role in the early detection of
      disease, the identification of the putative agent, and notification of the
      appropriate authorities. To be effective in this role, laboratories must be
      specially prepared to handle viral agents safely, and need, among other things,
      the appropriate rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests. In 1998 the European
      Network for Diagnostics of 'Imported' Viral Diseases (ENIVD) was established.
      ENIVD presently comprises, as permanent members, 44 expert laboratories in 21
      European Union (EU) member states and 4 non-EU countries and is one of the
      networks on infectious diseases funded by the European Commission. ENIVD fulfils 
      many of the important tasks required for the surveillance and control of
      imported, rare and emerging viral infections such as the exchange of expertise
      and the organisation of external quality assurance (EQA) programmes, both of
      which are needed to improve diagnostics. Here, we summarise the data generated by
      recent EQA activities focussed on the diagnostics of infections with hantavirus, 
      dengue virus, filovirus, Lassa virus, orthopox virus and the SARS-coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV). These were carried out between 1999 and 2004 and involved 93
      laboratories from 41 countries, including laboratories from additional countries 
      outside of Europe. Particularly the EU-candidate countries and Eastern
      neighbouring countries will be invited to join the network in the near future. A 
      public website is available at http://www.enivd.de.

TI  - A novel dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) analysis using
      artificial neural network (ANN).
PG  - 273-81
AB  - Dengue fever (DF) is an acute febrile viral disease frequently presented with
      headache, bone or joint and muscular pains, and rash. A significant percentage of
      DF patients develop a more severe form of disease, known as dengue haemorrhagic
      fever (DHF). DHF is the complication of DF. The main pathophysiology of DHF is
      the development of plasma leakage from the capillary, resulting in
      haemoconcentration, ascites, and pleural effusion that may lead to shock
      following defervescence of fever. Therefore, accurate prediction of the day of
      defervescence of fever is critical for clinician to decide on patient management 
      strategy. To date, no known literature describes of any attempt to predict the
      day of defervescence of fever in DF patients. This paper describes a non-invasive
      prediction system for predicting the day of defervescence of fever in dengue
      patients using artificial neural network. The developed system bases its
      prediction solely on the clinical symptoms and signs and uses the multilayer
      feed-forward neural networks (MFNN). The results show that the proposed system is
      able to predict the day of defervescence in dengue patients with 90% prediction
      accuracy.

PG  - 1-3
AB  - In November 2004, sponsored by the World Bank, the Venezuelan Foundation of
      Science, Technology and Innovation (Fonacit) and the Venezuelan Institute of
      Scientific Research (IVIC), delegates from the different virology research groups
      of the country, met in Caracas-Venezuela, with the aim to establish the
      "Venezuelan Virology Network". The symposium entitled "Molecular biology applied 
      to virus of health importance in Venezuela", was divided into three areas,
      including human and animals viruses related to public health: 1) Dengue, others
      arboviruses and Hemorrhagic Fevers; 2) diarrhea-related and others veterinary
      viruses and 3) Hepatitis, HIV and others sexually transmitted viruses. This
      symposium allowed the delegates to evaluate the current strengths, weaknesses and
      needs of the different laboratories, becoming evident the necessity of developing
      collaborative work between the groups that share the same interests or lines of
      research; and also their need to exchange technical resources, human and
      bibliographical material and consequently, avoiding the duplication of efforts
      and the unnecessary cost of resources. One of the main strengths of Venezuelan
      virology is the presence, in most laboratories, of researchers with studies of
      fourth level and multidisciplinary teams of work. We aspire to achieve the raised
      objectives in the event, to the benefit of our virology and even more important, 
      of our people.

TI  - Surveillance of imported diseases as a window to travel health risks.
PG  - 1-13
AB  - When using all its advantages of clinical vigilance, direct communication,and
      fast feedback, a clinical surveillance network can be remarkably effective in
      detecting sentinel events and in translating the new information into
      modifications of clinical practice. Travelers have great advantage when serving
      as surveillance tools for imported diseases. They travel widely and potentially
      expose themselves to all types of infectious diseases, they are very mobile, and 
      they return during the incubation period of most diseases to a medical system
      that is capable of achieving fast and definitive diagnosis. Clustering of
      infections in returnees can be used immediately to warn outbound travelers of a
      particular risk and to increase their protection. In addition, travelers can also
      serve as "canary birds" for disease outbreaks in developing countries that might 
      not be able to provide facilities for fast diagnosis. Information derived from
      returning travelers can be invaluable for the host country if channeled back to
      the medical authorities. TropNetEurop screening for increases in unexpected
      notifications has proved to be a sensitive early warning tool for the detection
      of increased transmission rates in endemic countries. For the future, it is hoped
      that traditional surveillance systems and recently introduced networks will be
      able to cooperate more fully. All systems have strengths and weaknesses and can
      gain from information provided by each other. Linkage of existing networks, which
      avoids duplication of work and fully exploits the information potential of all
      combined systems, should be targeted.

PG  - 145-52
AB  - The genomic sequences of the Envelope-Non-Structural protein 1 junction region
      (E/NS1) of 84 DEN-1 and 22 DEN-2 isolates from Brazil were determined. Most of
      these strains were isolated in the period from 1995 to 2001 in endemic and
      regions of recent dengue transmission in Sao Paulo State. Sequence data for DEN-1
      and DEN-2 utilized in phylogenetic and split decomposition analyses also include 
      sequences deposited in GenBank from different regions of Brazil and of the world.
      Phylogenetic analyses were done using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian
      approaches. Results for both DEN-1 and DEN-2 data are ambiguous, and support for 
      most tree bipartitions are generally poor, suggesting that E/NS1 region does not 
      contain enough information for recovering phylogenetic relationships among DEN-1 
      and DEN-2 sequences used in this study. The network graph generated in the split 
      decomposition analysis of DEN-1 does not show evidence of grouping sequences
      according to country, region and clades. While the network for DEN-2 also shows
      ambiguities among DEN-2 sequences, it suggests that Brazilian sequences may
      belong to distinct subtypes of genotype III.

TI  - [Comparison of serological procedures used for the diagnosis of viral exanthema
      in laboratories participating in the measles elimination plan].
PG  - 319-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The comparison of serological methods used by the laboratories
      participating in the Network for the Elimination of Measles to diagnose measles
      virus infection as well as differential diagnosis with other exanthematic
      diseases are compared. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One panel of 20 serum samples
      including measles (12), rubella (4), parvovirus B19 (2) and dengue (2) infections
      was established. All cases were diagnosed by detection of specific IgM. The panel
      was sent to the laboratories of the Network. The results were compared with those
      obtained at the reference laboratory. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Regarding measles, 
      IgM response from 20 laboratories (19 by ELISA and 1 by indirect
      immunofluorescence) was obtained, with an agreement of 91.5%. Related to rubella 
      IgM, replay from 6 laboratories, using ELISA, was received, with an agreement of 
      98.7%. With respect to parvovirus B19 IgM, response from 10 laboratories (8 by
      ELISA and 2 by indirect immunofluorescence) was obtained, with an agreement of
      94.6%. Results about dengue virus were not reported by any laboratory.
      CONCLUSION: Some laboratories from the network should review the methods used for
      the diagnosis of measles and other exanthematic diseases. The results reassert
      the need for a reference laboratory to support confirmation of the results.

TI  - External quality control assessment in PCR diagnostics of dengue virus
      infections.
PG  - 291-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased travelling to countries endemic for dengue fever (DF)
      demands efficient laboratory diagnostics. Nucleic acid amplification techniques
      (NAT) are now frequently used for rapid diagnosis of imported viral diseases.
      Different PCR systems are available. OBJECTIVES: In order to assess the quality
      of molecular diagnostics of dengue virus infections, an external quality
      assurance (EQA) in PCR diagnostics was conducted. STUDY DESIGN: A panel of 10
      human plasma samples was prepared and spiked with dengue virus types DEN-1 to
      DEN-4. In addition, a 10-fold dilution series (1:10-1:10(4) ) of DEN-3 virus was 
      included. The panel was pre-tested by nested RT-PCR, in-house real-time PCR, and 
      a commercial real-time PCR kit. The samples were inactivated by gamma irradiation
      and shipped in freeze dried state. Thirteen laboratories, within the European
      network for the diagnostics of imported viral diseases (ENIVD) took part using
      either single-round, nested, or real-time RT-PCR methods. Two laboratories used
      two methods in parallel, summarising up to 15 comparable results. RESULTS:
      33-100% correct results were achieved. All laboratories detected DEN-2 correctly,
      followed by DEN-1 (14 positive results of 15), DEN-3 (12/15) and DEN-4 (11/15).
      Testing of the serial dilution revealed low sensitivity in many labs, with
      results ranging from 33 to 80% of correctly tested samples. CONCLUSION: The EQA
      gives a feedback of the quality of the RT-PCR system used by each respective
      laboratory. The different test systems and amplification conditions demonstrate
      the importance of external quality control measures.

TI  - Illness in returned travellers presenting at GeoSentinel sites in New Zealand.
PG  - 82-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe illnesses of returned travellers presenting at GeoSentinel
      sites in New Zealand. METHODS: Record data for all patients presenting for
      travel-related illnesses seen at two GeoSentinel sites, operating as commercial
      travel clinics, in Auckland and Hamilton, NZ, were extracted for the period
      November 1997 to December 2001. RESULTS: 205 patients were identified with 262
      diagnoses. Just over half were females (54.21%) and nearly half were in the 25-35
      years age group (47.3%). About two-fifths of patients reported a pre-travel
      health consultation (41.0%). The commonest diseases diagnosed were diarrhoeal
      illnesses (23%), dermatological diagnoses (16%, excluding animal bites), animal
      bites (10%), and non-specific viral illnesses (8%), many of which manifest as
      respiratory infections. Tropical diseases, such as schistosomiasis (4%) malaria
      (2%) and dengue fever (0.5%), were not common. CONCLUSIONS: Information on
      travel-related illnesses, when reported through a global reporting system, can be
      useful for the travel health adviser in identifying issues of current concern.
      Although the frequency of tropical disease is low, it remains important to
      prevent these potentially fatal diseases. IMPLICATIONS: GeoSentinel makes a
      global contribution to the surveillance of emerging and re-emerging infectious
      diseases through a network of individual sites in various countries including New
      Zealand. This information can be used to help provide preventive advice for
      travellers as well as help in assessing illness in post-travel patients and
      potentially assist in preventing the secondary spread of some diseases acquired
      abroad following return.

TI  - The U.S.-Mexico Border Infectious Disease Surveillance project: establishing
      bi-national border surveillance.
PG  - 97-102
AB  - In 1997, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Mexican Secretariat 
      of Health, and border health officials began the development of the Border
      Infectious Disease Surveillance (BIDS) project, a surveillance system for
      infectious diseases along the U.S.-Mexico border. During a 3-year period, a
      binational team implemented an active, sentinel surveillance system for hepatitis
      and febrile exanthems at 13 clinical sites. The network developed surveillance
      protocols, trained nine surveillance coordinators, established serologic testing 
      at four Mexican border laboratories, and created agreements for data sharing and 
      notification of selected diseases and outbreaks. BIDS facilitated investigations 
      of dengue fever in Texas-Tamaulipas and measles in California-Baja California.
      BIDS demonstrates that a binational effort with local, state, and federal
      participation can create a regional surveillance system that crosses an
      international border. Reducing administrative, infrastructure, and political
      barriers to cross-border public health collaboration will enhance the
      effectiveness of disease prevention projects such as BIDS.

TI  - Epidemiology and clinical features of imported dengue fever in Europe: sentinel
      surveillance data from TropNetEurop.
PG  - 1047-52
AB  - Travelers have the potential both to acquire and to spread dengue virus
      infection. The incidence of dengue fever (DF) among European travelers certainly 
      is underestimated, because few centers use standardized diagnostic procedures for
      febrile patients. In addition, DF is currently not reported in most European
      public health systems. Surveillance has commenced within the framework of a
      European Network on Imported Infectious Disease Surveillance (TropNetEurop) to
      gain information on the quantity and severity of cases of dengue imported into
      Europe. Descriptions of 294 patients with DF were analyzed for epidemiological
      information and clinical features. By far the most infections were imported from 
      Asia, which suggests a high risk of DF for travelers to that region. Dengue
      hemorrhagic fever occurred in 7 patients (2.4%) all of whom recovered. Data
      reported by member sites of the TropNetEurop can contribute to understanding the 
      epidemiology and clinical characteristics of imported DF.

TI  - A method for active surveillance of selected communicable diseases.
PG  - 118-21
AB  - In 1991, an initiative was launched in the Western Pacific Region of WHO to
      eradicate poliomyelitis by the year 2000. Confirmation of eradication requires a 
      certification process, in which specific criteria must be met. A hospital-based
      surveillance system was developed. It was sensitive enough to detect, at least
      one case of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) per 100,000 children under age 15 per
      year, which is considered the "background rate" of AFP. This system was
      instituted in 1997 in most countries in the Pacific, and included measles and
      neonatal tetanus as well as AFP. By mid-1998, 53 hospitals in the Pacific were
      submitting monthly forms indicating whether or not AFP, suspect measles, or
      neonatal tetanus had been seen in the preceding month. Compliance was excellent, 
      with over 80% of forms submitted to WHO in 1998, thus meeting the certification
      standard. In 1999 a proposal was made to expand this method, in selected
      countries, to encompass most conditions presenting with acute fever plus rash,
      thus including, for example, cases of rubella and dengue. Important aspects of
      such surveillance include the capacity to confirm diagnoses in the laboratory,
      and to take effective public health action. A coordinated laboratory network had 
      been established previously for virological analysis of stool specimens for
      conditions causing AFP, but laboratory support for other conditions is currently 
      the responsibility of individual hospitals to arrange.

PG  - 69-78
AB  - This paper discusses popular participation in health from the point of view of an
      experience in dengue epidemic control in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the
      city of Rio de Janeiro. It refers specifically to a social movement called "Se
      Liga, Leopoldina", combining professionals (from health services and public
      schools) and members of popular organizations from the suburban neighborhoods
      served by the Leopoldina railway. The paper reviews the ideas motivating actions 
      undertaken by the movement, principally the role of popular organizations in the 
      control of endemics. It calls attention to the danger of preconceived notions
      when analyzing participation by members of popular organizations in the social
      movement. The author also calls attention to the fact that social scientists
      researching social movements should focus on being part of a wider social network
      of conviviality rather than seeing their role as educating members of the popular
      organization. Such networks should seek to strengthen and expand social support
      for the endemic control process.

AB  - The local Welfare and Health Authorities together with the country council of
      Reunion Island set up a medical supervision network for influenza and dengue
      fever in March 1996. Influenza of which the spreading over the island has never
      been well-researched is anticipated by a vaccination campaign organised in an
      empirical way after a model from the mother country (France). Dengue fever of
      which one of the vectors is omnipresent on the island ranged in an epidemic way
      in 1978. The aim of this network based on watching doctors, the laboratories of
      the island as well as the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar, is to adapt the
      prevention (Flu) and alert the Health Authorities in case of epidemic (Dengue).
      The article shows the results of 1996 observation and touches on the future of
      this type of supervision in a tropical environment.

      aspects].
PG  - 71-6
AB  - The epidemiology of dengue fever is changing dramatically. The worldwide
      incidence is rising and clinical symptoms are worsening. Reports describing forms
      associated with hemorrhage or shock syndrome involving both children and adults
      are increasingly frequent in regions beyond Southeast Asia where the first cases 
      were observed. Many mechanisms could be implicated in these changes including
      modifications of the virus, host, vector, or socioeconomic factors. Since no
      current model allows laboratory analysis of these mechanisms, observation of
      epidemics is still a major source of data. The findings of well conducted
      epidemiological studies allow not only assessment of morbidity and mortality in
      endemic areas and early detection of epidemic outbreaks but also evaluation of
      socioeconomic impact and effectiveness of control measures. Surveillance
      techniques must be chosen in function of prevailing local conditions. To ensure
      reliable results studies should be carried out in collaboration with an
      international network and a simple and accurate method of disease identification 
      should be used.

TI  - Dengue virus envelope glycoprotein can be secreted from insect cells as a fusion 
      with the maltose-binding protein.
PG  - 179-89
AB  - The maltose-binding protein (MalE) contains a signal sequence which allows its
      translocation in the periplasm of prokaryotic microorganisms. In this study, MalE
      was produced in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) lepidopterian cells using the
      baculovirus expression system. The secretion of MalE, following cleavage of its
      signal sequence, to the supernatant fluid of recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9
      cells and its affinity for maltodextrin polymers allowed recovery of significant 
      amounts (> or = 10 micrograms per 10(6) cells) of highly purified protein. The
      gene encoding the envelope glycoprotein E of the dengue (DEN) type 2 virus
      deleted of its C-terminal 102 amino acids (D2E delta 102) was fused to the MalE
      gene. The resulting hybrid MalE-D2E delta 102 glycoprotein was processed through 
      the Golgi network of Sf9 cells and was secreted. It was retained on a
      maltodextrin column and was eluted with maltose. Antigenic and immunogenic
      properties dependent on the three-dimensional structure in the native E protein
      were preserved in the recombinant MalE-D2E delta 102 protein. Thus MalE with its 
      signal sequence may be used as a carrier protein for production in the
      baculovirus system and purification of proteins which require transportation
      through intracellular compartments for correct folding and processing.

OAB - Environmental demography deals with socioenvironmental determinants of
      demographic processes. The fertility decline of recent years in Mexico is not
      associated with economic transformation, as the economic crisis, poverty,
      unemployment, and social inequality have been barely mitigated. Mexico is mainly 
      urban: 51% of the population lived in cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants
      in 1990 taking an increasing toll on the environment. The metropolitan area of
      Mexico City has 50% of industrial production with 36,000 industrial plants, 2100 
      of all 5400 chemical plants, 22% of total population, and 25% of economically
      active population. There are 3 million cars. 11,000 tons of solid waste is
      generated daily (75% domestic and 25% industrial), and 5 million tons of
      contaminants are emitted annually. Sulphur, dioxide, nitrogen, ozone, and
      suspended particulate levels often exceed international standards. In the federal
      district more than 1000 squatter colonies are without drainage that affects 5
      million people; and 30% of the population is without a sewage network. There are 
      35 cities with over 100,000 population that cannot meet their needs of drinking
      water with the result of a high level of gastrointestinal ailments, enteritis,
      diarrhea, rabies, and dengue fever caused by pathogenic microorganisms, the major
      cause of mortality. The degradation of the environment produces a pathological
      environmental emergency from chemical contamination of the air and from exposure 
      to industrial emissions, to agrochemical products and toxic substances, to lead, 
      insecticides, arsenic, and asbestos. Mexico has one of the highest levels of lead
      in the blood and DDT in mother's milk. In Mexico City lead concentration of 5
      mg/cubic meter in the air, 20 mg/100 ml in maternal blood, and 13 mg/100 ml in
      the umbilical cord was detected associated with retardation of mental development
      in the 1st year of life and chronic lead poisoning.

TI  - [The ocular fundus findings in dengue fever].
PG  - 24-30
AB  - From September to December of 1988, 24 cases of clinical diagnosed dengue fever
      accompanied by visual disturbances were studied. A detailed history and a
      detailed ocular examination including visual acuity, slit lamp examination,
      fundus examination through dilated pupil and fluorescein angiography were
      conducted. In some cases, Amsler grid, visual field, visual evoked potential and 
      color vision test were also evaluated. The chief complaints of these 24 patients 
      were blurred vision, central scotoma, floaters, photophobia and halo vision. The 
      intervals between onset of fever and awareness of blurred vision were 2 to 15
      days with an average of 7.26 days. The ocular fundus changes included macular
      hemorrhage, retinal hemorrhage, maculopathy, Roth's spot, diffuse retinal edema, 
      peripapillary hemorrhage vitreous cells and blurring optic disc. The fluorescein 
      angiographic findings included poor choroidal flushing, delayed disc filling,
      disc extravasation, block fluorescence, capillary obliteration, non filling of
      macular network, capillary leakage and window defect. Seventeen cases (30 eyes)
      were followed-up for 2 weeks to 3 months. Visual recovery was good in most of the
      cases. However, 2 cases (4 eyes) showed poor visual outcome. In this series
      studied, the principle ocular fundus change caused by dengue fever was macular
      hemorrhage. This may be due to the capillary changes near the macular area. But
      in some of the cases, the direct viral invasion and/or indirect changes of the
      optic nerve, the retinal pigment epithelium or photoreceptors should be
      considered.

TI  - Rational design of vaccines against enveloped RNA viruses.
PG  - 69-72
AB  - The enveloped RNA viruses are responsible for many important infectious diseases 
      both in the UK and worldwide. The most familiar of these would probably be
      influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, rabies, dengue and yellow fever. Conventional
      vaccines against all of the most widespread diseases have been available for
      several years, although with widely varying degrees of safety and efficacy.
      Although vaccines against diseases such as measles, rubella, and yellow fever
      have been fairly successful, all vaccines against diseases caused by this group
      of viruses still have several drawbacks and are in need of improvement for a
      variety of reasons. During the past decade our knowledge in several diverse areas
      of the biological sciences has expanded to the extent that it can now be combined
      and serious attempts made to design and engineer biological molecules with
      immunogenic potential. First, significant advances have been made in elucidating 
      the mechanisms operating in the immune defence network and in determining the
      structure of both immunogenic molecules and the components of the immune system
      with which they interact. Second, the development of recombinant DNA technology
      has enabled biological molecules to be synthesized under conditions not
      restricted by the characteristics of their parent organism. Such molecules can
      then be altered in such a way as to improve their efficiency and their level of
      production. It is the purpose of this paper to outline the problems associated
      with the production of vaccines against enveloped RNA viruses and to discuss how 
      recent advances in knowledge and techniques can help to overcome these problems.

TI  - Ultrastructural changes in skeletal muscles in dengue virus-infected mice.
PG  - 301-5
AB  - Dengue type 2 virus was inoculated intracerebrally in 20 adult swiss albino mice.
      Thigh muscles were removed after 24 h 3, 5 and 7 days after virus inoculation.
      Electron microscopic studies of the striated muscles show destruction of
      myofibrils, rarification of the sarcoplasmic reticulum network and changes in the
      mitochondria. Aggregates of electron-dense material as well as glycogen particles
      were also seen in the cytoplasm.
