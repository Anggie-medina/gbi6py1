TI  - Dynamics of Microbial Communities during the Removal of Copper and Zinc in a
      Sulfate-Reducing Bioreactor with a Limestone Pre-Column System.
LID - 1484 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031484 [doi]
AB  - Biological treatment using sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) is a promising
      approach to remediate acid rock drainage (ARD). Our purpose was to assess the
      performance of a sequential system consisting of a limestone bed filter followed 
      by a sulfate-reducing bioreactor treating synthetic ARD for 375 days and to
      evaluate changes in microbial composition. The treatment system was effective in 
      increasing the pH of the ARD from 2.7 to 7.5 and removed total Cu(II) and Zn(II) 
      concentrations by up to 99.8% and 99.9%, respectively. The presence of sulfate in
      ARD promoted sulfidogenesis and changed the diversity and structure of the
      microbial communities. Methansarcina spp. was the most abundant amplicon sequence
      variant (ASV); however, methane production was not detected. Biodiversity indexes
      decreased over time with the bioreactor operation, whereas SRB abundance remained
      stable. Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfocurvus, Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfovibrio
      became more abundant, while Desulfuromonadales, Desulfotomaculum and Desulfobacca
      decreased. Geobacter and Syntrophobacter were enriched with bioreactor operation 
      time. At the beginning, ASVs with relative abundance <2% represented 65% of the
      microbial community and 21% at the end of the study period. Thus, the results
      show that the microbial community gradually lost diversity while the treatment
      system was highly efficient in remediating ARD.

TI  - Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 supplementation modifies the fecal resistome
      during Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy.
PG  - e12870
LID - 10.1111/hel.12870 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota is a significant reservoir of antimicrobial
      resistance genes (ARGs). The use and misuse of antimicrobials can select
      multi-resistant bacteria and modify the repertoire of ARGs in the gut. Developing
      effective interventions to manipulate the intestinal resistome would allow us to 
      modify the antimicrobial resistance risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Applying shotgun
      metagenomics, we compared the composition of fecal resistome from individuals
      treated with triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori plus Saccharomyces boulardii 
      CNCM-I 745 (Sb) versus triple antibiotherapy without S. boulardii (control)
      before, after, and one month after treatments. DNA samples were sequenced on an
      Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. Reads were trimmed and filtered for quality, and 
      the reads classified as host genome were removed from further analysis. We used
      the ResFinder database for resistome analysis and the web-based tool
      ResistoXplorer and RStudio for graphical representation and statistical analysis.
      RESULTS: We identified 641 unique ARGs in all fecal samples, conferring
      resistance to 18 classes of antibiotics. The most prevalent ARGs found in at
      least 90% of the samples before the treatments were against tetracyclines, MLS-B 
      (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B), beta-lactams, and aminoglycosides.
      Differential abundance analysis allowed the identification of ARGs significantly 
      different between treatment groups. Thus, immediately after the treatments, the
      abundance of ARGs that confer resistance to lincosamides, tetracyclines, MLS-B,
      and two genes in the beta-lactam class (cfxA2 and cfxA3) was significantly lower 
      in the group that received Sb than in the control group (edgeR, FDR <0.05).
      CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the addition of S. boulardii CNCM-I 745
      to the conventional antibiotic eradication therapy for H. pylori reduced the
      abundance of ARGs, particularly those genes that confer resistance to
      lincosamides, tetracyclines, MLS-B, and a few genes in the beta-lactams class.

TI  - Proteorhodopsin Phototrophy in Antarctic Coastal Waters.
PG  - e0052521
LID - 10.1128/mSphere.00525-21 [doi]
AB  - Microbial proton-pumping rhodopsins are considered the simplest strategy among
      phototrophs to conserve energy from light. Proteorhodopsins are the most studied 
      rhodopsins thus far because of their ubiquitous presence in the ocean, except in 
      Antarctica, where they remain understudied. We analyzed proteorhodopsin abundance
      and transcriptional activity in the Western Antarctic coastal seawaters.
      Combining quantitative PCR (qPCR) and metagenomics, the relative abundance of
      proteorhodopsin-bearing bacteria accounted on average for 17, 3.5, and 29.7% of
      the bacterial community in Chile Bay (South Shetland Islands) during 2014, 2016, 
      and 2017 summer-autumn, respectively. The abundance of proteorhodopsin-bearing
      bacteria changed in relation to environmental conditions such as chlorophyll a
      and temperature. Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Flavobacteriia
      were the main bacteria that transcribed the proteorhodopsin gene during day and
      night. Although green light-absorbing proteorhodopsin genes were more abundant
      than blue-absorbing ones, the latter were transcribed more intensely, resulting
      in >50% of the proteorhodopsin transcripts during the day and night.
      Flavobacteriia were the most abundant proteorhodopsin-bearing bacteria in the
      metagenomes; however, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were more
      represented in the metatranscriptomes, with qPCR quantification suggesting the
      dominance of the active SAR11 clade. Our results show that
      proteorhodopsin-bearing bacteria are prevalent in Antarctic coastal waters in
      late austral summer and early autumn, and their ecological relevance needs to be 
      elucidated to better understand how sunlight energy is used in this marine
      ecosystem. IMPORTANCE Proteorhodopsin-bearing microorganisms in the Southern
      Ocean have been overlooked since their discovery in 2000. The present study
      identify taxonomy and quantify the relative abundance of proteorhodopsin-bearing 
      bacteria and proteorhodopsin gene transcription in the West Antarctic Peninsula's
      coastal waters. This information is crucial to understand better how sunlight
      enters this marine environment through alternative ways unrelated to
      chlorophyll-based strategies. The relative abundance of proteorhodopsin-bearing
      bacteria seems to be related to environmental parameters (e.g., chlorophyll a,
      temperature) that change yearly at the coastal water of the West Antarctic
      Peninsula during the austral late summers and early autumns.
      Proteorhodopsin-bearing bacteria from Antarctic coastal waters are potentially
      able to exploit both the green and blue spectrum of sunlight and are a prevalent 
      group during the summer in this polar environment.

TI  - Microbial community characterization of shrimp survivors to AHPND challenge test 
      treated with an effective shrimp probiotic (Vibrio diabolicus).
PG  - 88
LID - 10.1186/s40168-021-01043-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is an important
      shrimp bacterial disease caused by some Vibrio species. The severity of the
      impact of this disease on aquaculture worldwide has made it necessary to develop 
      alternatives to prophylactic antibiotics use, such as the application of
      probiotics. To assess the potential to use probiotics in order to limit the
      detrimental effects of AHNPD, we evaluated the effect of the ILI strain, a Vibrio
      sp. bacterium and efficient shrimp probiotic, using metabarcoding (16S rRNA gene)
      on the gastrointestinal microbiota of shrimp after being challenged with
      AHPND-causing V. parahaemolyticus. RESULTS: We showed how the gastrointestinal
      microbiome of shrimp varied between healthy and infected organisms. Nevertheless,
      a challenge of working with AHPND-causing Vibrio pathogens and Vibrio-related
      bacteria as probiotics is the potential risk of the probiotic strain becoming
      pathogenic. Consequently, we evaluated whether ILI strain can acquire the plasmid
      pV-AHPND via horizontal transfer and further cause the disease in shrimp.
      Conjugation assays were performed resulting in a high frequency (70%) of colonies
      harboring the pv-AHPND. However, no shrimp mortality was observed when
      transconjugant colonies of the ILI strain were used in a challenge test using
      healthy shrimp. We sequenced the genome of the ILI strain and performed
      comparative genomics analyses using AHPND and non-AHPND Vibrio isolates. Using
      available phylogenetic and phylogenomics analyses, we reclassified the ILI strain
      as Vibrio diabolicus. In summary, this work represents an effort to study the
      role that probiotics play in the normal gastrointestinal shrimp microbiome and in
      AHPND-infected shrimp, showing that the ILI probiotic was able to control
      pathogenic bacterial populations in the host's gastrointestinal tract and
      stimulate the shrimp's survival. The identification of probiotic bacterial
      species that are effective in the host's colonization is important to promote
      animal health and prevent disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes probiotic
      bacteria capable of controlling pathogenic populations of bacteria in the shrimp 
      gastrointestinal tract. Our work provides new insights into the complex dynamics 
      between shrimp and the changes in the microbiota. It also addresses the practical
      application of probiotics to solve problems with pathogens that cause high
      mortality-rate in shrimp farming around the world. Video Abstract.

TI  - Comparative Metagenomics of Palearctic and Neotropical Avian Cloacal Viromes
      Reveal Geographic Bias in Virus Discovery.

AB  - Our understanding about viruses carried by wild animals is still scarce. The
      viral diversity of wildlife may be best described with discovery-driven
      approaches to the study of viral diversity that broaden research efforts towards 
      non-canonical hosts and remote geographic regions. Birds have been key organisms 
      in the transmission of viruses causing important diseases, and wild birds are
      threatened by viral spillovers associated with human activities. However, our
      knowledge of the avian virome may be biased towards poultry and highly pathogenic
      diseases. We describe and compare the fecal virome of two passerine-dominated
      bird assemblages sampled in a remote Neotropical rainforest in French Guiana
      (Nouragues Natural Reserve) and a Mediterranean forest in central Spain (La
      Herreria). We used metagenomic data to quantify the degree of functional and
      genetic novelty of viruses recovered by examining if the similarity of the
      contigs we obtained to reference sequences differed between both locations. In
      general, contigs from Nouragues were significantly less similar to viruses in
      databases than contigs from La Herreria using Blastn but not for Blastx,
      suggesting that pristine regions harbor a yet unknown viral diversity with
      genetically more singular viruses than more studied areas. Additionally, we
      describe putative novel viruses of the families Picornaviridae, Reoviridae and
      Hepeviridae. These results highlight the importance of wild animals and remote
      regions as sources of novel viruses that substantially broaden the current
      knowledge of the global diversity of viruses.

TI  - Metagenomic Signatures of Gut Infections Caused by Different Escherichia coli
      Pathotypes.
LID - e01820-19 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01820-19 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli is a leading contributor to infectious diarrhea and child
      mortality worldwide, but it remains unknown how alterations in the gut microbiome
      vary for distinct E. coli pathotype infections and whether these signatures can
      be used for diagnostic purposes. Further, the majority of enteric diarrheal
      infections are not diagnosed with respect to their etiological agent(s) due to
      technical challenges. To address these issues, we devised a novel approach that
      combined traditional, isolate-based and molecular-biology techniques with
      metagenomics analysis of stool samples and epidemiological data. Application of
      this pipeline to children enrolled in a case-control study of diarrhea in Ecuador
      showed that, in about half of the cases where an E. coli pathotype was detected
      by culture and PCR, E. coli was likely not the causative agent based on the
      metagenome-derived low relative abundance, the level of clonality, and/or the
      virulence gene content. Our results also showed that diffuse adherent E. coli
      (DAEC), a pathotype that is generally underrepresented in previous studies of
      diarrhea and thus, thought not to be highly virulent, caused several small-scale 
      diarrheal outbreaks across a rural to urban gradient in Ecuador. DAEC infections 
      were uniquely accompanied by coelution of large amounts of human DNA and
      conferred significant shifts in the gut microbiome composition relative to
      controls or infections caused by other E. coli pathotypes. Our study shows that
      diarrheal infections can be efficiently diagnosed for their etiological agent and
      categorized based on their effects on the gut microbiome using metagenomic tools,
      which opens new possibilities for diagnostics and treatment.IMPORTANCE E. coli
      infectious diarrhea is an important contributor to child mortality worldwide.
      However, diagnosing and thus treating E. coli infections remain challenging due
      to technical and other reasons associated with the limitations of the traditional
      culture-based techniques and the requirement to apply Koch's postulates. In this 
      study, we integrated traditional microbiology techniques with metagenomics and
      epidemiological data in order to identify cases of diarrhea where E. coli was
      most likely the causative disease agent and evaluate specific signatures in the
      disease-state gut microbiome that distinguish between diffuse adherent,
      enterotoxigenic, and enteropathogenic E. coli pathotypes. Therefore, our
      methodology and results should be highly relevant for diagnosing and treating
      diarrheal infections and have important applications in public health.

AB  - In Quito, the microbiological contamination of surface water represents a public 
      health problem, mainly due to the lack of sewage treatment from urban wastewater.
      Contaminated water contributes to the transmission of many enteric pathogens
      through direct consumption, agricultural and recreational use. Among the
      different pathogens present in urban discharges, viruses play an important role
      on disease, being causes of gastroenteritis, hepatitis, meningitis, respiratory
      infections, among others. This study analyzes the presence of viruses in highly
      impacted surface waters of urban rivers using next-generation sequencing
      techniques. Three representative locations of urban rivers, receiving the main
      discharges from Quito sewerage system, were selected. Water samples of 500mL were
      concentrated by skimmed-milk flocculation method and the viral nucleic acid was
      extracted and processed for high throughput sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. The 
      results yielded very relevant data of circulating viruses in the capital of
      Ecuador. A total of 29 viral families were obtained, of which 26 species were
      associated with infections in humans. Among the 26 species identified, several
      were related to gastroenteritis: Human Mastadenovirus F, Bufavirus, Sapporovirus,
      Norwalk virus and Mamastrovirus 1. Also detected were: Gammapapillomavirus
      associated with skin infections, Polyomavirus 1 related to cases of kidney
      damage, Parechovirus A described as cause of neonatal sepsis with neurological
      affectations and Hepatovirus A, the etiologic agent of Hepatitis A. Other
      emergent viruses identified, of which its pathogenicity remains to be fully
      clarified, were: Bocavirus, Circovirus, Aichi Virus and Cosavirus. The wide
      diversity of species detected through metagenomics gives us key information about
      the public health risks present in the urban rivers of Quito. In addition, this
      study describes for the first time the presence of important infectious agents
      not previously reported in Ecuador and with very little reports in Latin America.

AB  - Symbionts (e.g., endoparasites and commensals) play an integral role in their
      host's ecology, yet in many cases their diversity is likely underestimated.
      Although endoparasites are traditionally characterized using morphology,
      sequences of conserved genes, and shotgun metagenomics, host transcriptomes
      constitute an underused resource to identify these organisms' diversity. By
      isolating non-host transcripts from host transcriptomes, individual host tissues 
      can now simultaneously reveal their endoparasite species richness (i.e., number
      of different taxa) and provide insights into parasite gene expression. These
      approaches can be used in host taxa whose endoparasites are mostly unknown, such 
      as those of tropical amphibians. Here, we focus on the poison frogs
      (Dendrobatidae) as hosts, which are a Neotropical clade known for their bright
      coloration and defensive alkaloids. These toxins are an effective protection
      against vertebrate predators (e.g., snakes and birds), bacteria, and skin-biting 
      ectoparasites (e.g., mosquitoes); however, little is known about their deterrence
      against eukaryotic endoparasites. With de novo transcriptomes of dendrobatids, we
      developed a bioinformatics pipeline for endoparasite identification that uses
      host annotated RNA-seq data and set of a priori parasite taxonomic terms, which
      are used to mine for specific endoparasites. We found a large community of
      helminths and protozoans that were mostly restricted to the digestive tract and a
      few systemic parasites (e.g., Trypanosoma). Contrary to our expectations, all
      dendrobatid frogs regardless of the presence of alkaloid defenses have
      endoparasites, with their highest species richness located in the frog digestive 
      tract. Some of these organisms (e.g., roundworms) might prove to be generalists, 
      as they were not found to be co-diversifying with their frog hosts. We propose
      that endoparasites may escape poison frogs' chemical defenses by colonizing
      tissues with fewer alkaloids than the frog's skin, where most toxins are stored.

AB  - Polluted environments are a reservoir of microbial species able to degrade or to 
      convert pollutants to harmless compounds. The proper management of microbial
      resources requires a comprehensive characterization of their genetic pool to
      assess the fate of contaminants and increase the efficiency of bioremediation
      processes. Metagenomics offers appropriate tools to describe microbial
      communities in their whole complexity without lab-based cultivation of individual
      strains. After a decade of use of metagenomics to study microbiomes, the
      scientific community has made significant progress in this field. In this review,
      we survey the main steps of metagenomics applied to environments contaminated
      with organic compounds or heavy metals. We emphasize technical solutions proposed
      to overcome encountered obstacles. We then compare two metagenomic approaches,
      i.e. library-based targeted metagenomics and direct sequencing of metagenomes. In
      the former, environmental DNA is cloned inside a host, and then clones of
      interest are selected based on (i) their expression of biodegradative functions
      or (ii) sequence homology with probes and primers designed from relevant, already
      known sequences. The highest score for the discovery of novel genes and
      degradation pathways has been achieved so far by functional screening of large
      clone libraries. On the other hand, direct sequencing of metagenomes without a
      cloning step has been more often applied to polluted environments for
      characterization of the taxonomic and functional composition of microbial
      communities and their dynamics. In this case, the analysis has focused on 16S
      rRNA genes and marker genes of biodegradation. Advances in next generation
      sequencing and in bioinformatic analysis of sequencing data have opened up new
      opportunities for assessing the potential of biodegradation by microbes, but
      annotation of collected genes is still hampered by a limited number of available 
      reference sequences in databases. Although metagenomics is still facing technical
      and computational challenges, our review of the recent literature highlights its 
      value as an aid to efficiently monitor the clean-up of contaminated environments 
      and develop successful strategies to mitigate the impact of pollutants on
      ecosystems.

TI  - Identification of novel toluene monooxygenase genes in a hydrocarbon-polluted
      sediment using sequence- and function-based screening of metagenomic libraries.
PG  - 797-808

AB  - The microbial potential for toluene degradation within sediments from a tar
      oil-contaminated site in Flingern, Germany, was assessed using a metagenomic
      approach. High molecular weight environmental DNA from contaminated sediments was
      extracted, purified, and cloned into fosmid and BAC vectors and transformed into 
      Escherichia coli. The fosmid library was screened by hybridization with a PCR
      amplicon of the alpha-subunit of the toluene 4-monooxygenase gene to identify
      genes and pathways encoding toluene degradation. Fourteen clones were recovered
      from the fosmid library, among which 13 were highly divergent from known tmoA
      genes and several had the closest relatives among Acinetobacter species. The BAC 
      library was transferred to the heterologous hosts Cupriavidus metallidurans
      (phylum Proteobacteria) and Edaphobacter aggregans (phylum Acidobacteria). The
      resulting libraries were screened for expression of toluene degradation in the
      non-degradative hosts. From expression in C. metallidurans, three novel toluene
      monooxygenase-encoding operons were identified that were located on IncP1
      plasmids. The E. aggregans-hosted BAC library led to the isolation of a cloned
      genetic locus putatively derived from an Acidobacteria taxon that contained genes
      involved in aerobic and anaerobic toluene degradation. These data suggest the
      important role of plasmids in the spread of toluene degradative capacity and
      indicate putative novel tmoA genes present in this hydrocarbon-polluted
      environment.
